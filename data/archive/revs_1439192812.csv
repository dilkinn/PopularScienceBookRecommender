The book was released on 15 September 2011 in the United Kingdom, and on 4 October 2011 in the United States. It is a graphic science book aimed primarily at children and young adults. Dawkins has stated that the book is intended for those aged around 12 years and upwards, and that when trialling the book prior to publishing, younger readers were able to understand its content with additional adult assistance.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هجدهم ماه فوریه سال 2017 میلادیعنوان: جادوی واقعیت، چطور میدانیم چه چیزی واقعا درست است؟؛ نویسنده: ریچارد داوکینز (داکینز)؛ تصویرگر: دیو مک‌کین؛ ترجمه و تنظیم: مینا خبوشانی، ویراستار: آرش حسینیان؛ ناشر: اینترنتی، 1392؛ فهرست کتاب: یک: واقعیت چیست؟ دو: اولین انسان چه کسی بود؟ سه: تنوع گونه‌ های جانوری به چه دلیل است؟ چهار: چیزها از چه ساخته شده‌ اند؟ پنج: چرا شب و روز، تابستان و زمستان داریم؟ شش: خورشید چیست؟ هفت: رنگین کمان چیست؟ هشت: چیزها چه زمانی و چگونه آغاز شدند؟ نه: آیا ما تنها هستیم؟ ده: زلزله چیست؟ یازده: چرا چیزهای بد اتفاق می‌افتند؟ دوازده: معجزه چیستبرخلاف کتاب ساعت‌ساز نابینا؛ و ژن خودخواه؛ که برای مخاطبان نسبتا سطح بالا نوشته شده، این‌بار قلم «ریچارد داکینز(داوکینز)» دارای زبانی ساده است و گویا، همگان آن را میفهمند. ایشان اینبار تلاش می‌کنند، تا شگفتی‌های علم را توضیح دهند. «ریچارد داوکینز»، مشهورترین زیست‌ شناس تکاملی با همکاری «دیو مک‌کین» هنرمند برجسته ی طراحی، با به‌ کارگیری نوشتار، و تصاویر گرافیکی، یکی از زیباترین و خواناترین کتاب‌های علمی عمومی را گردآوری کرده‌ اند. کتاب «جادوی واقعیت»، پاسخهایی ساده به پرسش‌هایی دشوار است. در این کتاب، «داکینز» کوشش می‌کنند، با ترکیب عقلانیت و شواهد موجود، پاسخی درست به پرسشها ارائه دهند. مسائلی که «داکینز» طرح می‌کنند، هم برای بزرگسالان جالب است و هم مورد علاقه ی نوجوانان است. مثلا در بخش نخستین: انسان چه کسی بود، نویسنده که خود از طرفداران فرگشت است، با بیانی ساده و جذاب نحوه ی فرگشت (تکامل) را شرح می‌دهد. یا مثلا در بخش: خورشید چیست، از داستان اسطوره‌ ها آغاز می‌کنند، و نهایتا به این می‌رسند که خورشید نه یک خدا، که یک ستاره است! نکته کتاب اینجاست، که تنها به علم زیست‌ شناسی (تخصص خود داکینز) و فرگشت محدود نمی‌شود. از فیزیک تا نجوم بحث می‌شوند. به‌ نوعی می‌توان گفت «ریچارد داکینز» سعی دارند در «جادوی واقعیت»، عقاید خرافی را از منطق علمی پاک کنند. ا. شربیانی"
1,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"To be sure, I need to be clear as to WHY I like this book. It's not like any of the science or reasoning in it is new or unusual, or that I haven't heard many similar reasonings here or there all the way from high school physics courses all the way to certain and strange movies I've enjoyed.Why I do love this book is simple: it's clear, concise, and it does a very admirable job of setting up magical thinking in all its flavors against the fundamentals of science.It's a great primer. I think I would have loved reading this when I was 13 or 14. It might have even sparked my interest in science even more than I had been sparked... but that might not be possible. Science Fiction did a perfectly admirable job in that department, with Heinlein and Asimov as my tutors.Even so, apart from the things I've heard about of Dawkins, this is relatively mild in the religion bashing. He uses logic and reasoning, postulating clearly and setting up the universe as it is, not as we wish it would be. He also makes sure that Occam's Razor is quite sharp.I certainly have no complaints about this book, assuming I wanted a basic primer, of course.As for being an adult reading this? It's charming. It's somewhat magical in the sense that I draw a sense of wonder about the universe and our living within it. For that alone I would recommend it as a bit of light reading, assuming you're up to your science snuff. :)"
2,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,5,"A surprising number of scientists feel that Richard Dawkins does the public understanding of science real harm through his belligerent attacks on religion, which turn off a good half of his potential audience, but no one can doubt that he has a talent for getting science, particularly biology, across to a general readership. This is his first attempt at a children's book (or rather a 'family' book as it is aimed at a wider readership) and it has much to praise.The Magic of Reality is a solid feeling hardback, half way between an ordinary non-fiction book and a coffee table book in format. Every page is illustrated by Dave McKean, with a mix of full colour photographs and diagrams, and heavily stylised line drawings - these last were perhaps a little angular and abstract for the younger audience, but overall the illustration is a good balance of supporting the text without overwhelming the page.The approach that Dawkins takes is an excellent one, picking up on ten key questions of science - 'What is reality? Who was the first person? Why are there so many different kinds of animals? What are things made of? Why do we have night and day, winter and summer? What is the sun? What is a rainbow? When and how did everything begin? Are we alone? and What is an Earthquake?' Each of these starts with ancient mythical explanations (where there are any) then goes on to detail the way that science answers the questions, using the starting point of the basic question to explore many different aspects of science that can be sensibly linked to it.All this works superbly well. Although it seems slightly odd that biology comes before the more fundamental physics and cosmology chapters, the absolute gem of the book (as you might expect) is the way that Dawkins handles 'Who was the first person?' His use of a stack of photographs, stretching back into the past, one of each generation, is masterful, inventive and wonderfully eye-opening. I love the way he really pushes the paradox that every creature in every generation is the same species as the previous generation's photograph - yet over the millions of years we can see a progression from fish-like creature to modern human. If ever there was a single bit of writing that could totally wipe out anyone's objections to evolution it's this chapter. I loved it. It will really challenge the readers to think and will open their eyes.However, it's important not to let the brilliance of much of the book hide a couple of significant flaws. In terms of science content, the huge disappointment is that Dawkins doesn't mention much modern physics. Both quantum theory and relativity really don't get any coverage. Particle physics only gets a passing reference with a wimp-out about the author not really understanding quarks. This isn't good enough. Omitting quantum theory and relativity from physics is like missing evolution out of biology - it's that significant an omission.The other problem I have is with the final two chapters. Because there aren't 10 questions, there are 12. The remaining two are 'Why do bad things happen?' and 'What is a miracle.' The first of these isn't too bad as it handles chance, but both are primarily Dawkins returning to his bugbear of attacking religion. I don't think this has a place in a science book, and it certainly shouldn't be given two chapters. I think this will confuse and quite probably bore younger readers, as after all the other wonders, these two chapters are, frankly, lacking in scientific joy. There is also one very dubious part. Dawkins suggests that readers use a method of assessing miracles that boils down to 'How do they stand up to common sense?' The trouble with this approach is much of modern physics doesn't fit with what common sense predicts. For that matter, most probability runs counter to common sense. As Dawkins himself points out, common sense expects that after a row of throwing heads, a coin is more likely to throw tails - but common sense gets it wrong. It seems highly spurious to use common sense as a scientific tool, when you've just shown it fails magnificently.I still think this is a great book, and I suspect many young readers will simply not bother with the last couple of chapters. Covering all of science is tricky, but despite the failings in physics, the rest of the book is good enough to make this, without doubt, one of the best children's science books of 2011.(Review originally posted on www.popularscience.co.uk - reproduced with permission)"
3,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,5,"I am still sizzling with delight over my latest Dawkins' read - having soaked up its information like a hungry sponge. It leaves the reader totally awed and dazzled with the world. I’m humming with it. The birds (plump with protons and neurons, atoms and molecules) are singing louder than ever in the garden, and that amazingly mysterious and wonderful star that we call the sun, (roaring away converting hydrogen to helium), shines even more brilliantly in the blue sky as we make a sedate path round it's circumference, twirling round and round on our axis at a giddy rate of 1000 miles per hour. Thank goodness for the stickiness of gravity, and Mother Earth's determination to keep us clasped to her bosom. Ahhhhh ...this book has made me so happy. At last, a book giving a fantastic overview of science that I can easily understand. I obviously have the science age of a 12 year old (the age group that everyone says the book is geared towards....)Something is wrong in my lauding of this book though. Dawkins wouldn’t like it. The term ""Mother Earth"" smacks of anthropomorphism, and he ain’t having any of it. In fact a good fifth of the book is dedicated to the recounting of various myths from around the world – including what he considers the Christian myth - and at the end of every segment on myths Dawkins goes on to show how science is better. Much much better than myth.In fact I mentioned I was reading this book to a neighbour, and he said “Yeah, Dawkins – that’s the guy who keeps banging on against God.” To have a scientist and communicator of the calibre of Dawkins referred to in those terms is I think terrible, but he has bought it upon himself. He just cannot live and let live. In fact I have changed my mind about what I said in the above paragraph... I have since read the Wikipedia article on Creationism (see the paragraphs headed ""Creationism internationally""). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CreationismGiven the large number of people who support the idea of Creationism - it is very good that Dawkins is arguing against it..... But I still don't like a lot of his other criticisms and quips against religion.

Taken from Richard Dawkins.net. Anyway, to get back to the science. This book is a.m.a.z.i.n.g. I learnt tons, and loved every minute of reading it. The chapters have headings which speak for themselves…and also illustrate well the age group Dawkins is appealing to.*Who was the first person?*Why are there so many different kinds of animals?*What are things made of?*Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?*What is the sun?*What is a rainbow?*When and how did everything begin?*Are we alone?*What is an earthquake?There isn’t one single diagram in the book. He does it all with words - but he is an incredibly brilliant writer, and it is utterly memorable and fascinating. Time and time again he wrote about things that I'd previously only half understood, and made them crystal clear. I feel hugely grateful to him. Highly recommended."
4,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4149976-emily,3,"I'm a big fan of Dawkins ever since reading The Selfish Gene many many years ago. However, I was very disppointed in this book, which is so basic that it shouldn't contain surprises for anyone who graduated from high school. There were no surprises and nothing really new - the most interesting part for me was how each chapter is introduced with an example of a myth that people have made up to explain some natural phenomenon, which the rest of the chapter then explains. I found the majority of it plodding, basic, and disappointing.HOWEVER ... on looking over some of the other reviews on Goodreads, I see several people saying this book is intended for younger readers. There was nothing at all in the book's description on Audible that indicated this. However, if that's the case then it's a good, clear, basic introduction for a kid around 8-12 years old. On that basis I'll give it 3 stars. As an adult book, which was my expectation of it, it was very basic stuff and came across rather condescending quite a lot of the time. Marks against the publisher for not making the intended audience extremely clear in the summary."
5,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1789091-noah,3,"I live in the United States in the 21st century. There is no greater danger to our species and our civilization right now than religious crazies. How can we ask our businesses to change the way they do business so as to prevent climate change if half of the country doesn't believe in scientific evidence? Or worse yet, if they expect a big bearded man to come down and bail us out if things get too bad?What about the people who believe that the world will end, in the next few years, with a war in the Middle East? What if their faith leads them to believe we should go to war to make this come about?Yes, these are scary people and there are a lot of them.I'd like to think that Mr. Dawkins had these people in mind when he wrote this book. It may be too late for the current generation who have turned their minds off and handed over their rational thought in exchange for ""faith."" But perhaps the next generation can be saved in time, and with their help we CAN actually do the work necessary to make the world a better place?From that perspective, this is an important and incredible book. It is a blow struck for logic over foolishness.But all the way through, I did find myself having mixed feelings. I don't think Mr. Dawkins really understands the purpose of the old myths and legends. The distinction between fairy tales and mythology seems to be missing from his understanding. When the old stories about the ""gods"" and nature of reality were written, they were neither meant to be ""just so stories"" nor were all of them intended to take the place of science. While he chooses to use the myths throughout his book to make his own book more entertaining, he clearly looks down on them and shows no consciousness that there is a deeper level of meaning to be found in mythology: the realm of the psychological. I would suggest he sit down and re-read his Joseph Campbell. The mythological creation of the world, the end of the world, the nature of mythological reality was never meant to be science. It was often meant to represent the internal journey of mankind.On page 202 he writes, ""We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories: we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy."" Why do we need to keep our imaginations in line? Can't we mature to the point at which we are able to partake in scientific investigation on Mondays and mythological investigation on Wednesdays? Can't we be trusted to learn the difference and keep them apart?Science cannot help us with questions of existence. It will never help us with ""How ought I act?"" or ""What meaning can I find in my life?"" ""What happens after we die?"" ""How can I find happiness?"" But perhaps the ancient knowledge, allied with philosophy, can be of some use with these (more important) problems?There are snide remarks here and there aimed at Astrology, aliens, and such. He may be right about many of them, but the attacks lack any logical depth.Overall, I would certainly recommend this book to any and all children of the right reading level, but I would also want to talk to that child as they were reading it. Maybe take them for a walk in the woods and teach them about talking to the trees. There certainly is more in the world we actually experience than is dreamnt of in Mr. Dawkins' science.Dave McKean, as always, is a master. His artwork is well worth the price of the book all by itself. He gets 16 stars. "
6,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12885473-darian-onaciu,5,"As a wee child - no, I'm not Scottish, I just like how 'wee' sounds - I was introverted and could rarely feel at ease while playing with other children.Unfortunately that was a problem because, being human, I also didn't enjoy being left out of activities. All that changed when I discovered the magic of reading books - no, I didn't turn into a robot from the Dungeon Dimensions.Now, don't get me wrong, I wasn't a hermit and got my periodic dose of socialization - yup, sounds cringeworthy - it's just that I felt more at ease with a book because I could travel to new worlds, identify with heroes and villains, see with my mind's eye fictitious or real wonders - yup, way more entertaining than the games children usually play.While in secondary school I started with reading folk and fairy tales and at some point got to a book whose title would be loosely translated as The Legends of the Olympus.I liked it a lot and started wondering about truth, gods, superpowers and religions - you know, as all children do at some point.So I started asking questions and the more answers I received, being born in a country where more than 80% are orthodox, the more I was convinced that one of the best ways someone could get closer to the Truth and be able to better understand the world around us would be to become a priest.Being a respectable goal to pursue, my mother and grandparents, although none were regular churchgoers, encouraged me to do so. So I picked up a Bible and started reading it, only to discover it was full of metaphors and words that as a child I couldn't understand - so I got bored and put it down, nonetheless retaining my faith in a higher power.Years passed by and after the 8th grade national exam I got in at a very good high-school in my small town, in a class with a STEM specialization focusing on Information Technology and Mathematics.I was the odd duck from the class who excelled at English - foreign language - and Romanian - the national language of the country I was born in. I wrote poems depicting my teenage angst and some short prose - speaking of which, I'm sure I'd get a good laugh if I'd discover my 'writings'.I still liked to read but my reading habits, as far as I can remember, just exited the era of Jules Verne's works and gravitated towards books like Oliver Twist, White Fang, Robinson Crusoe and so on. But my reading habits were about to change due to a totally unexpected factor: my new girlfriend. We were classmates and she was a rare combo: one of the smartest and cutest - the best, if you're perchance reading this review (she liked to argue a lot). She was way better than me in STEM but I had the edge in humanities. She introduced me to J. K. Rowling, Frank Herbert, Carl Sagan and more.I really looked up to her.So when she told me she was an atheist and I told her I was a believer, well, the two hormonal teenage universes clashed and although I can't exactly remember, there is about a 100% chance we had an expletive filled fight about it.But with all our differences we cared about each other and continued being together for a few years.More than her looks and academic smarts I appreciated the books we shared and her astuteness in conversation.We talked about anything and everything debating pros and cons. It didn't matter if the subject was asinine or something crucially important like 'would someone after being subjected to teleportation be the same person or merely a clone of the original?'She pushed me out of my comfort zone, stretched my mind and I loved her for it.But belief was a touchy subject. Although I went to church only at special occasions throughout the year, I considered myself a believer. But I also considered myself a smart person who liked to read and ask questions to better understand the Universe.But what if those questions started to elicit uncomfortable emotions?Which identity would prevail then?Questions like: ""Why is there more than one religion?""""How can you tell that you believe in the right one?""""Wouldn't the time of your existence in history, the place you were born in and/or your parents influence your choice of religion more than your free will?""""If there is a God then why are bad things happening to good people?"" and so on.Had it been out then, this book would have been the perfect gift for me.In fact, if I could travel back in time I'd gift it to my secondary school self - though I'm sure he would only partially understand it - then travel a bit forward and hand it to my high school self.Be a kind person and gift this book to people who are curious and like to ask questions.I had to realize on my own through reading books, having interesting conversations and just plain living, that people are creatures of habit, that we act more on an emotional than logical basis, that there are a throng of cognitive biases which continuously incapacitate our decision making and obstruct our evolution. And make no mistake, changing one's mind is strictly a personal journey. But should we tolerate our faults by recognizing our limitations we can make tremendous progress and see the beauty of the Universe not through n interpretations of unchanging ancient texts but through the lens of the only incrementally self actualizing instrument: science.Jesus, this turned out to be a bit personal."
7,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76465748-hanum-salsabila,4,"4.5 ⭐I already read too much fiction this month, so i would try with some academic book. This book is so good. Dawkins made it quite fun, most parts of this book aren’t boring at all. The way he narrated this book is really humble, he isn’t patronized us the reader, and he admitted that he still didn’t understand some part and somehow made himself equal to the reader (of course he isn’t).However, i found a few other parts of the book is a little bit boring. Like the atom part, the explanation is quite long.I found many interesting information in this book like how to measure time in fossils with radioactive clocks using uranium-238, sun and it’s mythology, and also the question i’ve always wanted to know : who is the first person on earth? And the idea that auto immune disease could be a weapon to fight cancer is really fascinating. This book ends with my favorite chapter about several miracles and the possibility that really happened at that time. Well done, Dawkins. I would totally read all of your books."
8,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74466071-charlie-hasler,5,"I enjoyed this read very much. I have read The God Delusion but that is the only other Dawkins book I have read.I enjoy Dawkins ""right between the eyes"" style of writing. This is a superb read, very interesting and complicated science is broken down so even knuckle draggers like me can understand it."
9,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18959010-nihal-vrana,1,"This was the worst popular science book that I have read. It was lazily-written with no real structure rather than flimsy chapter beginnings with myths. The information in it was extremely random and superficial. I'm sorry to say this but it is nothing more than a rant of a famous person than a popular science book with an aim to inform its audience. I used to enjoy Dawkins' books back in the day; when they were about topics which he has a good grasp of (i.e. evolution). But I really don't like what he has become since then, a figurehead basically who does not refrain from giving his opinion on any topic at all. For example, his ""speculation"" about auto-immune diseases in the book shows that he really did not understand them very well, yet it did not stop him from talking about them. The beauty of science is that it never really needs to defend itself. The proofs it comes up with always speak for themselves. When you understand them thoroughly, you will be convinced anyway. So the science does not need ""Champions"", it convinces by evidence. But somehow over the last 10 years, Mr. Dawkins became a self-proclaimed champion of science which, as a professional researcher, irks me. The language, content and style of this book added to my dislike of him as a popular figure."
10,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1575042-antonia,3,"Great book: clear and accessible (not sure of the best age group, though). Kids are naturally curious and fascinated by how the world works. They're also susceptible to all kinds of nonsense, of course. This much-needed book fill s a gap between simplistic kids' books and adult science books. Also, we need books that help kids understand, not just the facts of the world, but how we know them and, more generally, how do we know whether something's true or not? And I should think this book would be invaluable to parents, a good many of whom could probably not explain natural selection, DNA, plate tectonics, or probability.Where else could one find so much in one book? And the illustrations by Dave McKean are astonishing —though somewhat overwhelming. Sometimes too large and distracting. I don't like the weirdly formatted titles with mixed, funky fonts in different colors and sizes (within the same title, that is). But that's me.I couldn't tell what age group he's addressing. I read somewhere that he's said about age 12 and up. But sometimes he sounds he's talking to six-year-olds. At other times, he uses terms like ""the scientific method."" Huh, what? The tone bugged me all the way through. The best children's books are those that don't talk down, that adults can enjoy just as much as a 12-year-old. I didn't (always) find that to be true of this one. I had some mixed feelings about the content, though — not the scientific content, but the way he makes fun of myths, etc. Okay, they're not literally true, but. . . . There's a difference between fairytales and mythology. As another Goodreads reviewer (Noah) has said: ""When the old stories about the ""gods"" and nature of reality were written, they were neither meant to be ""just so stories"" nor were all of them intended to take the place of science.."" The tone bothered me a bit, too. I didn't care for the authorial intrusion. Noah also quotes Dawkins here: ""We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories: we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy."" Noah then asks, ""Why do we need to keep our imaginations in line?"" Good point. ""Science . . . will never help us with ""How ought I act?"" or ""What meaning can I find in my life?"" . . . ""How can I find happiness?"" But perhaps the ancient knowledge, allied with philosophy, can be of some use with these problems. . . . ""I have no sense at all of how kids would respond to this (don't have any). I would love to see this book reviewed by some 12-year-olds.Apparently, there's a very cool iPad version, which I haven't seen. "

Maybe i am to young to understand everything so i think i will try again in a couple of years!"
12,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-again,4,"A good dose of reality for any youngster patient enough to read it. It's written in a style that is meant to help early adolescents make sense of the things they've been taught, and determine which ones are fact-based. It's a nice introduction to critical thinking, with a lot of science, a little history, and a smattering of myth. Be prepared to have your religious teachings challenged. This IS Richard Dawkins, after all."

An excellent gift for all occasions.Negatives: 1. The book is intended for a younger audience and covers briefly a lot of topics. If you are expecting an in-depth analysis. This is not the book for you. 2. No bibliography.In summary, a fabulous book for all to enjoy. I usually limit my purchases to Kindle books because of the convenience but I'm glad I was ""forced"" to buy this book in hardcover binding. It's a beautiful book inside and out. Substance finally matches style and it's a science book for all to enjoy and for years to come. There is a sense of awe, a poetic magic for reality. For all his knowledge, Professor Dawkins is humbled by what little we do know and how much more we need to find out about the world. It's precisely this drive to know more and that hunger for knowledge that I always wanted to convey to my children. Finally, I have a book that expresses my sentiments and I have Richard Dawkins to thank!"

I am glad to have found The Magic of Reality : How We Know What's Really True. Richard Dawkins is a British biologist. The book includes 12 chapters. Topics include evolution, natural selection, biology, cosmology and physics, but mostly importantly, what is scientific reasoning and how to tell reality from myth and imaginations.The message is clear: the reality itself is beautiful; it is wonderful to pursue scientific truth; we do not need supernaturals to make us feel special. I think these messages are important and relevant in an age where anti-science and conspiracy theories taking hold of our political and daily life.Richard Dawkins is an atheist and a vocal critic of organized religions. There are several mentions of bible stories but his tone is very mild in this book."
16,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2892211-jason-mills,4,"Dawkins here seeks to enthuse young minds about science: not only with its discoveries but as an approach to the world that is far more thrilling and fascinating - not to say productive - than the idle stories and easy answers of myth and religion. Indeed, it is inherently an encouragement to learn and to challenge one's intellect, rather than to remain ignorant.Each chapter addresses a question about the world: What are things made of? What is a rainbow? Dawkins commences in each case by recounting myths from around the world. He acknowledges that these stories are enjoyable and interesting, but he does not need to work hard to show their inadequacies as explanations. (Dawkins bundles in the myths of current religions with those of ancient or 'minor' ones, which is perfectly legitimate, if a tad mischievous; but he does not hammer the reader over the head with that angle: the word ""atheist"", for instance, does not appear.)Then follows the scientific view of the phenomenon in question, carefully and clearly articulated. Although generally well pitched for an audience entering their teenage years, his prose is sometimes a little demanding:The Chumash people believed that they were created on their island (it obviously wasn't called Santa Cruz then, because that is a Spanish name) from the seeds of a magic plant by the Earth goddess Hutash, who was married to the Sky Snake (what we know as the Milky Way, which you can see on a really dark night in the country, but not if you live in a town where there is too much light pollution).Somebody should have told him not to squeeze two or three sentences into one! Such lapses are rare, however, and the text is a thoroughly engaging read.Of course, it's only half the story. It scarcely does justice to Dave McKean's contribution here to say that he ""illustrated"" The Magic Of Reality: he has designed the book from cover to cover, winding the text in and out of the art, playing visual games, creating pictures in ethnic styles corresponding to the cultures whose myths are under discussion, and eloquently illustrating the scientific ideas. Admirable as the text is, it would form a far less lively book without this consummate, diverse and colourful graphic enrichment.Putting both together, this is a splendid celebration. It may be an unusually large slab of non-fiction for the average teenager, but those with the appetite for it will be amply rewarded."
17,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11940616-james,5,"I don't think I can put it any better than the quote from Ricky Gervais on the back of this book:""I wanted to write this book, but I wasn't smart enough. Now that I've read it, I am.""This is an excellent book even for those who like me, were generally familiar with most of the concepts tackled within it already. The trick to knowing whether you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them understand it too. Before reading this book I'm not sure I could have done that, but now I'm pretty sure I can.The Magic of Reality is, as Dawkins describes in it's opening pages, an explanation of some of the most genuinely awe-inspiring things that science has discovered about both our world and the universe. From the first chapter on what exactly reality is (not as easy a concept as it appears) to it's final chapter entitled ""What is a miracle?"" (containing some well designed examples that link up neatly with the opening), it guides the reader through several concepts and discoveries including, but not limited to: who the first person was (spoiler: there wasn't one), why we have winter and summer (which was something I thought I knew but was completely wrong about), how the universe began and the misconception of asking why bad things happen.Most chapters open with some charming and interesting myths from various human tribes and civilisations throughout history about the subject that the chapter itself tackles. This is not only to show just what the human brain is capable of inventing (and believing), but to show that no matter what stories we may invent, the truth of what is really happening is far more enticing.Read it."
18,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10901897-alastair,2,"Whilst I would not dare to fault Dawkins' science, to describe his grasp of the role of myth and story in social evolution as 'limited' would, yet again, be generous. Philip Pullman is quoted in the cover: 'The clearest and most beautifully written introduction to science I've ever read.' Perhaps Mr Pullman read a pre-publication edition in which the writing wasn't dominated by a 1950's avuncular style, peppered with complex concepts and language, the understanding of which is assumed. Also to call this an introduction to science is, surely, to have misunderstood its purpose: demytholigisation. A task which I would actually have little problem with, were it not for the patronizingly simplistic approach to the myths themselves. Having said, that, the book is on my shelf (Dave McKean's illustrations, alone, make it worth keeping) and I will use it as a prompt for further thought on narrative approaches to the world - I will just have to fight the temptation to hurl it at the wall every six or so pages. "
19,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1026591-christian-mckay,2,"Hmm . . . Okay, let's get this out of the way first. Dave McKean's art is, as always, on point. It's worth the price of admission. I do find it strange to see a man, who brought so many of Neil Gaiman's fantastical works to life, turn around and help another guy DISPROVE FAIRIES FOR SOME REASON. But he's unbelievably good at lending visuals to big ideas. His illustrations of the myths Dawkins is shitting all over are just as captivating as his illustrations of scientific principles.Dawkins' prose is clear and concise, if a little stuffy. This is a perfectly fine refresher on the basics of the scientific laws that govern our universe. But when it comes to the beliefs of ""primitive"" people, he becomes patronizing, as if he's convinced that if he lived in ancient times, he would have solved the rules of the universe no problem. K, bro. And he sneakily weaves in his moralistic atheism throughout. I don't have a problem with atheism, but eh, it feels misplaced here.Finally, I'm confused as to who this is for. It's written like it's for children, but in a weighty package that feels better suited for adults. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I think I learned something new once every thirty pages or so. You'll know pretty early whether or not this book is for you."
20,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,4,"After a long period of time I picked up Dawkins's work and it was indeed a delightful reading. Though largely the book is catering to younger audiences but still has learning for all ages. He delves into the magic of reality which is indeed the science. Here is an opening to the book:-"" The third meaning of magic is the one I mean in my title: poetic magic. We are moved to tears by a beautiful piece of music and we describe the performance as ‘magical’. We gaze up at the stars on a dark night with no moon and no city lights and, breathless with joy, we say the sight is ‘pure magic’. We might use the same word to describe a gorgeous sunset, or an alpine landscape, or a rainbow against a dark sky. In this sense, ‘magical’ simply means deeply moving, exhilarating: something that gives us goose bumps, something that makes us feel more fully alive. What I hope to show you in this book is that reality – the facts of the real world as understood through the methods of science – is magical in this third sense, the poetic sense, the good to be alive sense."" Throughout the book there is immense amount of discussion on evolution. Evolution through natural selection is indeed one of the greatest ideas propounded and ofcourse established through ample evidences. Also Dawkins takes digs at various myths and religions and this is expected from the author."
21,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27781063-dyary-abubakr,4,"Magic is a slippery word:  Dawkins wrote it is commonly used in three different ways, and the first thing I must do is distinguish between them. I'll call the first one 'supernatural magic', the second one 'stage magic' and the third one (which is my favourite meaning, and the one I intend in my title) 'poetic magic' What I hope to show you in this book is that reality – the facts of the real world as understood through the methods of science – is magical in this third sense, the poetic sense, the good to be alive sense... the kind I call poetic magic: an inspiring beauty which is all the more magical because it is real and because we can understand how it works. This book, which has twelve chapters and each chapter starts with a question, a simple question that one day myths have been created to explain it, a question like "" Why are there so many different kinds of animal? may has many myths trying to explain them, and that's what dawkins shows in every chapter, he shows you the myths that have been created to explain a natural phenomenon, they may be cute, delightful, fun , but not real and that's what dawkins is trying to show, he is trying to show whats really real, by only science , science is the way to find answers to these questions, and when we do, when we finally know the answer the nature you normally see becomes a magic, a magic of reality."
22,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,2,"I didn't like the approach of this book. I liked the God Delusion and I liked some of his other books on evolution especially The Greatest Show on Earth, but this one is kind of a bad combo of the two. He basically pits Religious and Mythical tradition against ""the Magic of Science and the reality of Nature"". Whether he meant to do that or not this is definitely the way it comes across and I think this is a terrible approach. I am a great lover of reading religion and mythical tradition for what it teaches us about people, about history and about civilized thought. I also believe that you don't frankly need to pit anything against nature and science to see the beauty of it. They both have intrinsically fascinating qualities and bring people a lot of joy and happiness in the experience. Whether or not you believe myths/religions as actual truth I think is somewhat irrelevant, they are still valuable to culture, tradition, and interactions with other people, in finding the way that shapes human thought. I just didn't like the way he went about the subject/topic at all in this book. I thought it a bit in poor taste frankly. "
23,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I enjoy reading and learning about myths. I devour a good ghost story. I actively seek out tales of the supernatural. But I also believe that the greatest magic of all is the magic of reality, and for that reason, I love science.This was a library copy, but after reading, it's one I'll purchase if only so I can have it around for the kids to thumb through. In fact, it is written in such a basic and easily digestible format that I am considering using in my home school curriculum.This beautifully illustrated celebration of science and its role in solving the mysteries of the unknown will likely appeal to readers who appreciate that things don't have to be unexplainable to be magical. It's not so much that there is anything new here for the science reader. It's somewhat basic. But it does succeed at reminding us that not knowing isn't a justification for making things up. Most science lovers already know this, still it was fun(and somewhat poignant) to read the myths people created before we found the answers. It's clear that as far as we come, we've got a long, long way to go."
24,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36755002-kacey-kells,4,"« We should always be open-minded, but the only good reason to believe that something exists is if there is a real evidence that it does ». Richard Dawkins’ aim is to promote rationalism and the scientific method (i.e. proposing a model and then testing it), rejecting myths and the supernatural. Hence, he addresses key issues such as: the evolution of species and natural selection, organic chemistry and Carbon based life, atoms (“what things are made of”), rainbows and the dispersion of light, the nature (and evolution) of stars, planets, galaxies, and the universe…But don’t be afraid to read this book! In spite of the great complexity of these issues, it is EASY to read.Frankly, I read Richard Dawkins’ “Magic of Reality” with pleasure; is it because I’m the daughter of a physicist? I do not know… but I recommend it strongly."
25,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Another excellent book by Dawkins narrated by him & Lalla Ward, one of my favorite narrating teams. Dawkins covers a lot of basic science with its history. He tells a few of the legends about what various peoples around the globe have thought about natural phenomena & how science has found out what really takes place. It really is magical, in a poetic sense & he shows that very well. The universe is a fascinating place with a lot of questions remaining to be answered.He doesn't beat on religion too much in this book beyond pointing out how its explanations have been superseded by scientific discoveries. If you know someone who isn't well educated in science & wants to know a bit more, this is a great book to give them. That includes kids from about 12 & up. Dawkins is very clear & concise in his explanations. Highly recommended.Table of Contents:1. What is reality? What is magic?2. Who was the first person?3. Why are there so many different kinds of animals?4. What are things made of?5. Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?6. What is the sun?7. What is a rainbow?8. When and how did everything begin?9. Are we alone?10. What is an earthquake?11. Why do bad things happen?12. What is a miracle?"
26,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7006637-santhosh,4,"The book covers a lot of basic science topics in brief, serving as a good, clear, basic introduction to evolution, natural selection, genetics, molecular physics, cosmology, astronomy, plate tectonics and probability. While the stated audience for this book is 12-year olds, I would say it also makes a good read for intelligent adults whose science grounding is poor. The biggest current danger isn't kids not getting some education, but rather growing up into adults who falsely believe in religious dogma and wrongly assign the role of science only to laboratories and inventions - only to scientists. Adults would also do well to brush up their knowledge of the basics of our world and how these basics interact and add-up into the larger picture. To that order, this is an excellent book, one that I can ask anyone to be comfortable with first if they want to make conversation to me at the bar.As to be expected, Dawkins is in his element when speaking about his pet subject: evolutionary biology, where he draws a vivid and clear walk-through on evolution. The pieces on atoms and the forces that govern their world, speculations on extra-terrestrial life, cosmology, plate tectonics, and probability as related to 'life just is' are all excellent at what the essays set out to do: explain what they are. Overall, Dawkins is able to provide a simple and broken-down explanation of each of the topics, covering them from the individual components to the overall picture. I just wish Carl Sagan had been somehow involved in this, as he would have added his badly missed passion and child-like sense of wonder when explaining science - something which would have helped immensely to make this book, otherwise a little dry, more enjoyable.To me, Dawkins came across as fighting demons in his head while writing this book, by directing his answers toward an imagined audience holding on to their unscientific beliefs. The book thus comes across as a little contemptuous and confronting in its tone, which instead of being mildly mocking as intended, comes across as petulant and irksome while reading. For example, I'm sure that Dawkins understands what mythology is and its role in social evolution. To disdainfully table all of mythology as ignorant ramblings meant only to provide explanations of a particular natural phenomena is to underestimate and subvert the intelligence of our ancestors.In summary, an excellent idea behind the book, and in large parts follows through in the delivery as well."
27,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6068530-jim-whitefield,5,"Armed with the foreknowledge that this book is written to appeal to quite young readers as well as other ages, you will not feel Dawkins is as condescending in tone as you might otherwise be drawn to conclude. In my opinion, he does a marvellous job of writing in a fashion that will entertain and retain the interest of youngsters, whilst at the same time enthralling those of us who are of a much older generation. Beautifully illustrated throughout and with numerous wonderful photos as well, the book covers a dozen chapters on the reality of various interesting scientific aspects within which Dawkins also cunningly intertwines myths and legends surrounding them, including quite naturally, many biblical myths and legends which he phrases in ways that make them laughable rather than remotely plausible. Atheism permeates the book in a manner which is very hard to refute. He makes his readers 'think'. He is extremely adept at putting things into (simple) scientific perspective. He includes myths in pretty much every chapter, apart from the one on things so small you can't see them - and as he explains, there are no myths about them because, in terms of the evolution of human knowledge, until relatively recently, no one knew about them, so there are no myths or legends about them... simple when you think! He includes some internet links to YouTube material which are interesting, except unfortunately, the first one comes up with a notice that it is no longer available because of ""multiple third-party notifications of copyright infringement"" which is a shame as I am sure the publishers felt they had covered that. Perhaps it will get sorted out. Overall, whilst I already knew quite a lot of the things he talks about, even so, there was much I learned and I found the whole experience like being a young teenager again, learning from the best books, in the most interesting and informative - not to mention easy to understand - way imaginable. Well done Richard - I hope there will be more of these. Kids deserve such knowledge and perspective while they are as young as possible. This book should form part of the education curriculum worldwide. For me, this is yet another 'must read'. Brilliant."
28,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"I'm not entirely sure why I still read Dawkins' work. I think he's an extremely intelligent person, of course, and I've enjoyed reading books that focus on science by him -- I love The Ancestor's Tale, for example. But I hate the way that he cannot stop poking at religion, and I expected to hate it even more in a book called The Magic of Reality.Actually, he's more respectful than usual. It all seems rather toned down, since it's aimed at a younger audience than his other books (which is somewhat insulting in itself; I read and understood The Ancestor's Tale perfectly at the age of thirteen, and this book is aimed at 'ages twelve and up', I'm told). It can come across as condescending, though I rather appreciated the parts where he admits he doesn't know everything. It is accessible, for people of any age and any level of knowledge about science, covering basic topics like why we have seasons and what earthquakes are. It's quite enjoyable to read even though I don't think I learnt anything new, because it clarified things and connected ideas.He is, of course, scathing about religion and dismissive of any belief in the supernatural, but if you're planning to read Dawkins, you probably know that already."

With its lovely illustrations and clear explanations, it's an amazing gift for children.I didn't include adults because I assume they already know these basic facts of science. In reality though, I've encountered people, even some college graduates who don't know these basic stuff. And, frankly, I find it astonishing that many adults either don't know anything about or care about science. I'm not talking about rocket science. I'm talking about the fundamental questions of where we come from, our evolution, the planet we live on, what are stuff made of ... Generally things any conscious being should be interested in. We are incredibly lucky to know much more, and to have some exciting answers to these old questions. In my opinion, it's one of the great privileges we have compared to our early ancestors and indeed the rest of life on this earth that come and go without ever knowing the reason for their existence. Anyway, that's it for my rant. The point is, go get this book for any young person in your life because there's nothing grander than the Magic of Reality! ;)"

The book was released on 15 September 2011 in the United Kingdom, and on 4 October 2011 in the United States. It is a graphic science book aimed primarily at children and young adults. Dawkins has stated that the book is intended for those aged around 12 years and upwards, and that when trialling the book prior to publishing, younger readers were able to understand its content with additional adult assistance.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هجدهم ماه فوریه سال 2017 میلادیعنوان: جادوی واقعیت، چطور میدانیم چه چیزی واقعا درست است؟؛ نویسنده: ریچارد داوکینز (داکینز)؛ تصویرگر: دیو مک‌کین؛ ترجمه و تنظیم: مینا خبوشانی، ویراستار: آرش حسینیان؛ ناشر: اینترنتی، 1392؛ فهرست کتاب: یک: واقعیت چیست؟ دو: اولین انسان چه کسی بود؟ سه: تنوع گونه‌ های جانوری به چه دلیل است؟ چهار: چیزها از چه ساخته شده‌ اند؟ پنج: چرا شب و روز، تابستان و زمستان داریم؟ شش: خورشید چیست؟ هفت: رنگین کمان چیست؟ هشت: چیزها چه زمانی و چگونه آغاز شدند؟ نه: آیا ما تنها هستیم؟ ده: زلزله چیست؟ یازده: چرا چیزهای بد اتفاق می‌افتند؟ دوازده: معجزه چیستبرخلاف کتاب ساعت‌ساز نابینا؛ و ژن خودخواه؛ که برای مخاطبان نسبتا سطح بالا نوشته شده، این‌بار قلم «ریچارد داکینز(داوکینز)» دارای زبانی ساده است و گویا، همگان آن را میفهمند. ایشان اینبار تلاش می‌کنند، تا شگفتی‌های علم را توضیح دهند. «ریچارد داوکینز»، مشهورترین زیست‌ شناس تکاملی با همکاری «دیو مک‌کین» هنرمند برجسته ی طراحی، با به‌ کارگیری نوشتار، و تصاویر گرافیکی، یکی از زیباترین و خواناترین کتاب‌های علمی عمومی را گردآوری کرده‌ اند. کتاب «جادوی واقعیت»، پاسخهایی ساده به پرسش‌هایی دشوار است. در این کتاب، «داکینز» کوشش می‌کنند، با ترکیب عقلانیت و شواهد موجود، پاسخی درست به پرسشها ارائه دهند. مسائلی که «داکینز» طرح می‌کنند، هم برای بزرگسالان جالب است و هم مورد علاقه ی نوجوانان است. مثلا در بخش نخستین: انسان چه کسی بود، نویسنده که خود از طرفداران فرگشت است، با بیانی ساده و جذاب نحوه ی فرگشت (تکامل) را شرح می‌دهد. یا مثلا در بخش: خورشید چیست، از داستان اسطوره‌ ها آغاز می‌کنند، و نهایتا به این می‌رسند که خورشید نه یک خدا، که یک ستاره است! نکته کتاب اینجاست، که تنها به علم زیست‌ شناسی (تخصص خود داکینز) و فرگشت محدود نمی‌شود. از فیزیک تا نجوم بحث می‌شوند. به‌ نوعی می‌توان گفت «ریچارد داکینز» سعی دارند در «جادوی واقعیت»، عقاید خرافی را از منطق علمی پاک کنند. ا. شربیانی"
31,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"To be sure, I need to be clear as to WHY I like this book. It's not like any of the science or reasoning in it is new or unusual, or that I haven't heard many similar reasonings here or there all the way from high school physics courses all the way to certain and strange movies I've enjoyed.Why I do love this book is simple: it's clear, concise, and it does a very admirable job of setting up magical thinking in all its flavors against the fundamentals of science.It's a great primer. I think I would have loved reading this when I was 13 or 14. It might have even sparked my interest in science even more than I had been sparked... but that might not be possible. Science Fiction did a perfectly admirable job in that department, with Heinlein and Asimov as my tutors.Even so, apart from the things I've heard about of Dawkins, this is relatively mild in the religion bashing. He uses logic and reasoning, postulating clearly and setting up the universe as it is, not as we wish it would be. He also makes sure that Occam's Razor is quite sharp.I certainly have no complaints about this book, assuming I wanted a basic primer, of course.As for being an adult reading this? It's charming. It's somewhat magical in the sense that I draw a sense of wonder about the universe and our living within it. For that alone I would recommend it as a bit of light reading, assuming you're up to your science snuff. :)"
32,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,5,"A surprising number of scientists feel that Richard Dawkins does the public understanding of science real harm through his belligerent attacks on religion, which turn off a good half of his potential audience, but no one can doubt that he has a talent for getting science, particularly biology, across to a general readership. This is his first attempt at a children's book (or rather a 'family' book as it is aimed at a wider readership) and it has much to praise.The Magic of Reality is a solid feeling hardback, half way between an ordinary non-fiction book and a coffee table book in format. Every page is illustrated by Dave McKean, with a mix of full colour photographs and diagrams, and heavily stylised line drawings - these last were perhaps a little angular and abstract for the younger audience, but overall the illustration is a good balance of supporting the text without overwhelming the page.The approach that Dawkins takes is an excellent one, picking up on ten key questions of science - 'What is reality? Who was the first person? Why are there so many different kinds of animals? What are things made of? Why do we have night and day, winter and summer? What is the sun? What is a rainbow? When and how did everything begin? Are we alone? and What is an Earthquake?' Each of these starts with ancient mythical explanations (where there are any) then goes on to detail the way that science answers the questions, using the starting point of the basic question to explore many different aspects of science that can be sensibly linked to it.All this works superbly well. Although it seems slightly odd that biology comes before the more fundamental physics and cosmology chapters, the absolute gem of the book (as you might expect) is the way that Dawkins handles 'Who was the first person?' His use of a stack of photographs, stretching back into the past, one of each generation, is masterful, inventive and wonderfully eye-opening. I love the way he really pushes the paradox that every creature in every generation is the same species as the previous generation's photograph - yet over the millions of years we can see a progression from fish-like creature to modern human. If ever there was a single bit of writing that could totally wipe out anyone's objections to evolution it's this chapter. I loved it. It will really challenge the readers to think and will open their eyes.However, it's important not to let the brilliance of much of the book hide a couple of significant flaws. In terms of science content, the huge disappointment is that Dawkins doesn't mention much modern physics. Both quantum theory and relativity really don't get any coverage. Particle physics only gets a passing reference with a wimp-out about the author not really understanding quarks. This isn't good enough. Omitting quantum theory and relativity from physics is like missing evolution out of biology - it's that significant an omission.The other problem I have is with the final two chapters. Because there aren't 10 questions, there are 12. The remaining two are 'Why do bad things happen?' and 'What is a miracle.' The first of these isn't too bad as it handles chance, but both are primarily Dawkins returning to his bugbear of attacking religion. I don't think this has a place in a science book, and it certainly shouldn't be given two chapters. I think this will confuse and quite probably bore younger readers, as after all the other wonders, these two chapters are, frankly, lacking in scientific joy. There is also one very dubious part. Dawkins suggests that readers use a method of assessing miracles that boils down to 'How do they stand up to common sense?' The trouble with this approach is much of modern physics doesn't fit with what common sense predicts. For that matter, most probability runs counter to common sense. As Dawkins himself points out, common sense expects that after a row of throwing heads, a coin is more likely to throw tails - but common sense gets it wrong. It seems highly spurious to use common sense as a scientific tool, when you've just shown it fails magnificently.I still think this is a great book, and I suspect many young readers will simply not bother with the last couple of chapters. Covering all of science is tricky, but despite the failings in physics, the rest of the book is good enough to make this, without doubt, one of the best children's science books of 2011.(Review originally posted on www.popularscience.co.uk - reproduced with permission)"
33,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,5,"I am still sizzling with delight over my latest Dawkins' read - having soaked up its information like a hungry sponge. It leaves the reader totally awed and dazzled with the world. I’m humming with it. The birds (plump with protons and neurons, atoms and molecules) are singing louder than ever in the garden, and that amazingly mysterious and wonderful star that we call the sun, (roaring away converting hydrogen to helium), shines even more brilliantly in the blue sky as we make a sedate path round it's circumference, twirling round and round on our axis at a giddy rate of 1000 miles per hour. Thank goodness for the stickiness of gravity, and Mother Earth's determination to keep us clasped to her bosom. Ahhhhh ...this book has made me so happy. At last, a book giving a fantastic overview of science that I can easily understand. I obviously have the science age of a 12 year old (the age group that everyone says the book is geared towards....)Something is wrong in my lauding of this book though. Dawkins wouldn’t like it. The term ""Mother Earth"" smacks of anthropomorphism, and he ain’t having any of it. In fact a good fifth of the book is dedicated to the recounting of various myths from around the world – including what he considers the Christian myth - and at the end of every segment on myths Dawkins goes on to show how science is better. Much much better than myth.In fact I mentioned I was reading this book to a neighbour, and he said “Yeah, Dawkins – that’s the guy who keeps banging on against God.” To have a scientist and communicator of the calibre of Dawkins referred to in those terms is I think terrible, but he has bought it upon himself. He just cannot live and let live. In fact I have changed my mind about what I said in the above paragraph... I have since read the Wikipedia article on Creationism (see the paragraphs headed ""Creationism internationally""). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CreationismGiven the large number of people who support the idea of Creationism - it is very good that Dawkins is arguing against it..... But I still don't like a lot of his other criticisms and quips against religion.

Taken from Richard Dawkins.net. Anyway, to get back to the science. This book is a.m.a.z.i.n.g. I learnt tons, and loved every minute of reading it. The chapters have headings which speak for themselves…and also illustrate well the age group Dawkins is appealing to.*Who was the first person?*Why are there so many different kinds of animals?*What are things made of?*Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?*What is the sun?*What is a rainbow?*When and how did everything begin?*Are we alone?*What is an earthquake?There isn’t one single diagram in the book. He does it all with words - but he is an incredibly brilliant writer, and it is utterly memorable and fascinating. Time and time again he wrote about things that I'd previously only half understood, and made them crystal clear. I feel hugely grateful to him. Highly recommended."
34,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4149976-emily,3,"I'm a big fan of Dawkins ever since reading The Selfish Gene many many years ago. However, I was very disppointed in this book, which is so basic that it shouldn't contain surprises for anyone who graduated from high school. There were no surprises and nothing really new - the most interesting part for me was how each chapter is introduced with an example of a myth that people have made up to explain some natural phenomenon, which the rest of the chapter then explains. I found the majority of it plodding, basic, and disappointing.HOWEVER ... on looking over some of the other reviews on Goodreads, I see several people saying this book is intended for younger readers. There was nothing at all in the book's description on Audible that indicated this. However, if that's the case then it's a good, clear, basic introduction for a kid around 8-12 years old. On that basis I'll give it 3 stars. As an adult book, which was my expectation of it, it was very basic stuff and came across rather condescending quite a lot of the time. Marks against the publisher for not making the intended audience extremely clear in the summary."
35,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1789091-noah,3,"I live in the United States in the 21st century. There is no greater danger to our species and our civilization right now than religious crazies. How can we ask our businesses to change the way they do business so as to prevent climate change if half of the country doesn't believe in scientific evidence? Or worse yet, if they expect a big bearded man to come down and bail us out if things get too bad?What about the people who believe that the world will end, in the next few years, with a war in the Middle East? What if their faith leads them to believe we should go to war to make this come about?Yes, these are scary people and there are a lot of them.I'd like to think that Mr. Dawkins had these people in mind when he wrote this book. It may be too late for the current generation who have turned their minds off and handed over their rational thought in exchange for ""faith."" But perhaps the next generation can be saved in time, and with their help we CAN actually do the work necessary to make the world a better place?From that perspective, this is an important and incredible book. It is a blow struck for logic over foolishness.But all the way through, I did find myself having mixed feelings. I don't think Mr. Dawkins really understands the purpose of the old myths and legends. The distinction between fairy tales and mythology seems to be missing from his understanding. When the old stories about the ""gods"" and nature of reality were written, they were neither meant to be ""just so stories"" nor were all of them intended to take the place of science. While he chooses to use the myths throughout his book to make his own book more entertaining, he clearly looks down on them and shows no consciousness that there is a deeper level of meaning to be found in mythology: the realm of the psychological. I would suggest he sit down and re-read his Joseph Campbell. The mythological creation of the world, the end of the world, the nature of mythological reality was never meant to be science. It was often meant to represent the internal journey of mankind.On page 202 he writes, ""We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories: we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy."" Why do we need to keep our imaginations in line? Can't we mature to the point at which we are able to partake in scientific investigation on Mondays and mythological investigation on Wednesdays? Can't we be trusted to learn the difference and keep them apart?Science cannot help us with questions of existence. It will never help us with ""How ought I act?"" or ""What meaning can I find in my life?"" ""What happens after we die?"" ""How can I find happiness?"" But perhaps the ancient knowledge, allied with philosophy, can be of some use with these (more important) problems?There are snide remarks here and there aimed at Astrology, aliens, and such. He may be right about many of them, but the attacks lack any logical depth.Overall, I would certainly recommend this book to any and all children of the right reading level, but I would also want to talk to that child as they were reading it. Maybe take them for a walk in the woods and teach them about talking to the trees. There certainly is more in the world we actually experience than is dreamnt of in Mr. Dawkins' science.Dave McKean, as always, is a master. His artwork is well worth the price of the book all by itself. He gets 16 stars. "
36,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12885473-darian-onaciu,5,"As a wee child - no, I'm not Scottish, I just like how 'wee' sounds - I was introverted and could rarely feel at ease while playing with other children.Unfortunately that was a problem because, being human, I also didn't enjoy being left out of activities. All that changed when I discovered the magic of reading books - no, I didn't turn into a robot from the Dungeon Dimensions.Now, don't get me wrong, I wasn't a hermit and got my periodic dose of socialization - yup, sounds cringeworthy - it's just that I felt more at ease with a book because I could travel to new worlds, identify with heroes and villains, see with my mind's eye fictitious or real wonders - yup, way more entertaining than the games children usually play.While in secondary school I started with reading folk and fairy tales and at some point got to a book whose title would be loosely translated as The Legends of the Olympus.I liked it a lot and started wondering about truth, gods, superpowers and religions - you know, as all children do at some point.So I started asking questions and the more answers I received, being born in a country where more than 80% are orthodox, the more I was convinced that one of the best ways someone could get closer to the Truth and be able to better understand the world around us would be to become a priest.Being a respectable goal to pursue, my mother and grandparents, although none were regular churchgoers, encouraged me to do so. So I picked up a Bible and started reading it, only to discover it was full of metaphors and words that as a child I couldn't understand - so I got bored and put it down, nonetheless retaining my faith in a higher power.Years passed by and after the 8th grade national exam I got in at a very good high-school in my small town, in a class with a STEM specialization focusing on Information Technology and Mathematics.I was the odd duck from the class who excelled at English - foreign language - and Romanian - the national language of the country I was born in. I wrote poems depicting my teenage angst and some short prose - speaking of which, I'm sure I'd get a good laugh if I'd discover my 'writings'.I still liked to read but my reading habits, as far as I can remember, just exited the era of Jules Verne's works and gravitated towards books like Oliver Twist, White Fang, Robinson Crusoe and so on. But my reading habits were about to change due to a totally unexpected factor: my new girlfriend. We were classmates and she was a rare combo: one of the smartest and cutest - the best, if you're perchance reading this review (she liked to argue a lot). She was way better than me in STEM but I had the edge in humanities. She introduced me to J. K. Rowling, Frank Herbert, Carl Sagan and more.I really looked up to her.So when she told me she was an atheist and I told her I was a believer, well, the two hormonal teenage universes clashed and although I can't exactly remember, there is about a 100% chance we had an expletive filled fight about it.But with all our differences we cared about each other and continued being together for a few years.More than her looks and academic smarts I appreciated the books we shared and her astuteness in conversation.We talked about anything and everything debating pros and cons. It didn't matter if the subject was asinine or something crucially important like 'would someone after being subjected to teleportation be the same person or merely a clone of the original?'She pushed me out of my comfort zone, stretched my mind and I loved her for it.But belief was a touchy subject. Although I went to church only at special occasions throughout the year, I considered myself a believer. But I also considered myself a smart person who liked to read and ask questions to better understand the Universe.But what if those questions started to elicit uncomfortable emotions?Which identity would prevail then?Questions like: ""Why is there more than one religion?""""How can you tell that you believe in the right one?""""Wouldn't the time of your existence in history, the place you were born in and/or your parents influence your choice of religion more than your free will?""""If there is a God then why are bad things happening to good people?"" and so on.Had it been out then, this book would have been the perfect gift for me.In fact, if I could travel back in time I'd gift it to my secondary school self - though I'm sure he would only partially understand it - then travel a bit forward and hand it to my high school self.Be a kind person and gift this book to people who are curious and like to ask questions.I had to realize on my own through reading books, having interesting conversations and just plain living, that people are creatures of habit, that we act more on an emotional than logical basis, that there are a throng of cognitive biases which continuously incapacitate our decision making and obstruct our evolution. And make no mistake, changing one's mind is strictly a personal journey. But should we tolerate our faults by recognizing our limitations we can make tremendous progress and see the beauty of the Universe not through n interpretations of unchanging ancient texts but through the lens of the only incrementally self actualizing instrument: science.Jesus, this turned out to be a bit personal."

Dawkins made it quite fun, most parts of this book aren’t boring at all. The way he narrated this book is really humble, he isn’t patronized us the reader, and he admitted that he still didn’t understand some part and somehow made himself equal to the reader (of course he isn’t).However, i found a few other parts of the book is a little bit boring. Like the atom part, the explanation is quite long.I found many interesting information in this book like how to measure time in fossils with radioactive clocks using uranium-238, sun and it’s mythology, and also the question i’ve always wanted to know : who is the first person on earth? And the idea that auto immune disease could be a weapon to fight cancer is really fascinating. This book ends with my favorite chapter about several miracles and the possibility that really happened at that time. Well done, Dawkins. I would totally read all of your books."
38,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74466071-charlie-hasler,5,"I enjoyed this read very much. I have read The God Delusion but that is the only other Dawkins book I have read.I enjoy Dawkins ""right between the eyes"" style of writing. This is a superb read, very interesting and complicated science is broken down so even knuckle draggers like me can understand it."
39,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18959010-nihal-vrana,1,"This was the worst popular science book that I have read. It was lazily-written with no real structure rather than flimsy chapter beginnings with myths. The information in it was extremely random and superficial. I'm sorry to say this but it is nothing more than a rant of a famous person than a popular science book with an aim to inform its audience. I used to enjoy Dawkins' books back in the day; when they were about topics which he has a good grasp of (i.e. evolution). But I really don't like what he has become since then, a figurehead basically who does not refrain from giving his opinion on any topic at all. For example, his ""speculation"" about auto-immune diseases in the book shows that he really did not understand them very well, yet it did not stop him from talking about them. The beauty of science is that it never really needs to defend itself. The proofs it comes up with always speak for themselves. When you understand them thoroughly, you will be convinced anyway. So the science does not need ""Champions"", it convinces by evidence. But somehow over the last 10 years, Mr. Dawkins became a self-proclaimed champion of science which, as a professional researcher, irks me. The language, content and style of this book added to my dislike of him as a popular figure."
40,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1575042-antonia,3,"Great book: clear and accessible (not sure of the best age group, though). Kids are naturally curious and fascinated by how the world works. They're also susceptible to all kinds of nonsense, of course. This much-needed book fill s a gap between simplistic kids' books and adult science books. Also, we need books that help kids understand, not just the facts of the world, but how we know them and, more generally, how do we know whether something's true or not? And I should think this book would be invaluable to parents, a good many of whom could probably not explain natural selection, DNA, plate tectonics, or probability.Where else could one find so much in one book? And the illustrations by Dave McKean are astonishing —though somewhat overwhelming. Sometimes too large and distracting. I don't like the weirdly formatted titles with mixed, funky fonts in different colors and sizes (within the same title, that is). But that's me.I couldn't tell what age group he's addressing. I read somewhere that he's said about age 12 and up. But sometimes he sounds he's talking to six-year-olds. At other times, he uses terms like ""the scientific method."" Huh, what? The tone bugged me all the way through. The best children's books are those that don't talk down, that adults can enjoy just as much as a 12-year-old. I didn't (always) find that to be true of this one. I had some mixed feelings about the content, though — not the scientific content, but the way he makes fun of myths, etc. Okay, they're not literally true, but. . . . There's a difference between fairytales and mythology. As another Goodreads reviewer (Noah) has said: ""When the old stories about the ""gods"" and nature of reality were written, they were neither meant to be ""just so stories"" nor were all of them intended to take the place of science.."" The tone bothered me a bit, too. I didn't care for the authorial intrusion. Noah also quotes Dawkins here: ""We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories: we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy."" Noah then asks, ""Why do we need to keep our imaginations in line?"" Good point. ""Science . . . will never help us with ""How ought I act?"" or ""What meaning can I find in my life?"" . . . ""How can I find happiness?"" But perhaps the ancient knowledge, allied with philosophy, can be of some use with these problems. . . . ""I have no sense at all of how kids would respond to this (don't have any). I would love to see this book reviewed by some 12-year-olds.Apparently, there's a very cool iPad version, which I haven't seen. "

It's written in a style that is meant to help early adolescents make sense of the things they've been taught, and determine which ones are fact-based. It's a nice introduction to critical thinking, with a lot of science, a little history, and a smattering of myth. Be prepared to have your religious teachings challenged.

It would help my ""reviewer cred"". Thanks and enjoy this wonderful book.The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True by Richard Dawkins""The Magic of Reality"" is the latest contribution by evolutionary-biologist icon Richard Dawkins. Professor Dawkins is on a mission of education and in this enlightening book he reaches a younger audience by introducing science like only he can. In one of the most beautifully illustrated science books, he takes the reader on a ride on a wide-range of topics of interest that masterfully navigates between myth and what is real. This mesmerizing 272-page book is composed of the following twelve chapters: 1. What is reality? What is magic? , 2. Who was the first person? , 3. Why are there so many different kinds of animals? , 4. What are things made of? , 5. Why do we have night and day, winter and summer? , 6. What is the sun? , 7. What is a rainbow? , 8. When and how did everything begin? , 9. Are we alone? , 10. What is an earthquake? , 11. Why do bad things happen? ,and 12. What is a miracle?Positives: 1. A wonderful book on science that is accessible to a younger audience without compromising the science lovers in all of us. Bravo! 2. It's a book written by the great Richard Dawkins, so you know the quality goes in before the product goes out. 3. A true labor of love. The educator in Professor Dawkins comes out and now even our children will benefit from his prodigious knowledge. 4. One of the most beautifully illustrated books you will ever find. Great quality binding only matched by its substance. 5. Science knowledge conveyed in a brilliant, lucid manner. 6. Great format. In each chapter, Professor Dawkins illustrates clearly the difference between the wishful and what is ""really"" real. 7. What a wonderful way to learn about science. Great practical examples throughout this beautiful book. A ride of knowledge, hop on! Readers of all ages will enjoy this great book. 8. Even-handed and pleasant tone throughout. 9. A wide range of fascinating science topics in the hands of the master. 10. Great wisdom throughout, ""We should always be open-minded, but the only good reason to believe that something exists is if there is real evidence that it does"". 11. The book cleverly goes from myth to reality. 12. The concept of magic in three tiers: supernatural, stage and poetic. 13. Evolution in the hands of the master. Awesome. 14. Was there ever a first person? Insightful indeed. The best illustrated example I've ever read. 15. Great explanation on DNA. 16. Clever examples throughout, one of the many strengths of this book. 17. A wide range of fascinating science topic in the hands of a master. 18. The three common phases of matter. 19. The importance of the scientific meyhod. 20. The concept of empty space...I finally get it. 21. The importance of carbons, organic chemistry. 22. Telling that there are no myths to describe atoms... 23. So what causes the difference between winter and summer...find out. 24. The illusion of relative movement. 25. The great Isaac Newton. Gravity, lights...we are not worthy. 26. The difference between mass and weight. 27. A great illustration of how far stars are from us. 28. How coal is created. 29.

Fascinating. 47. Miracles what they are. 48. David Hume's irrefutable logic regarding miracles and many great examples. 49. Absolutely kindles the fire of learning. 50. An excellent gift for all occasions.Negatives: 1. The book is intended for a younger audience and covers briefly a lot of topics. If you are expecting an in-depth analysis. This is not the book for you. 2. No bibliography.In summary, a fabulous book for all to enjoy. I usually limit my purchases to Kindle books because of the convenience but I'm glad I was ""forced"" to buy this book in hardcover binding. It's a beautiful book inside and out. Substance finally matches style and it's a science book for all to enjoy and for years to come. There is a sense of awe, a poetic magic for reality. For all his knowledge, Professor Dawkins is humbled by what little we do know and how much more we need to find out about the world. It's precisely this drive to know more and that hunger for knowledge that I always wanted to convey to my children. Finally, I have a book that expresses my sentiments and I have Richard Dawkins to thank!"
45,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"In these days it's easy to find factual science and technology books, but books about scientific reasoning are rare, rarer for young readers. I am glad to have found The Magic of Reality : How We Know What's Really True. Richard Dawkins is a British biologist. The book includes 12 chapters. Topics include evolution, natural selection, biology, cosmology and physics, but mostly importantly, what is scientific reasoning and how to tell reality from myth and imaginations.The message is clear: the reality itself is beautiful; it is wonderful to pursue scientific truth; we do not need supernaturals to make us feel special. I think these messages are important and relevant in an age where anti-science and conspiracy theories taking hold of our political and daily life.Richard Dawkins is an atheist and a vocal critic of organized religions. There are several mentions of bible stories but his tone is very mild in this book."
46,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2892211-jason-mills,4,"Dawkins here seeks to enthuse young minds about science: not only with its discoveries but as an approach to the world that is far more thrilling and fascinating - not to say productive - than the idle stories and easy answers of myth and religion. Indeed, it is inherently an encouragement to learn and to challenge one's intellect, rather than to remain ignorant.Each chapter addresses a question about the world: What are things made of? What is a rainbow? Dawkins commences in each case by recounting myths from around the world. He acknowledges that these stories are enjoyable and interesting, but he does not need to work hard to show their inadequacies as explanations. (Dawkins bundles in the myths of current religions with those of ancient or 'minor' ones, which is perfectly legitimate, if a tad mischievous; but he does not hammer the reader over the head with that angle: the word ""atheist"", for instance, does not appear.)Then follows the scientific view of the phenomenon in question, carefully and clearly articulated. Although generally well pitched for an audience entering their teenage years, his prose is sometimes a little demanding:The Chumash people believed that they were created on their island (it obviously wasn't called Santa Cruz then, because that is a Spanish name) from the seeds of a magic plant by the Earth goddess Hutash, who was married to the Sky Snake (what we know as the Milky Way, which you can see on a really dark night in the country, but not if you live in a town where there is too much light pollution).Somebody should have told him not to squeeze two or three sentences into one! Such lapses are rare, however, and the text is a thoroughly engaging read.Of course, it's only half the story. It scarcely does justice to Dave McKean's contribution here to say that he ""illustrated"" The Magic Of Reality: he has designed the book from cover to cover, winding the text in and out of the art, playing visual games, creating pictures in ethnic styles corresponding to the cultures whose myths are under discussion, and eloquently illustrating the scientific ideas. Admirable as the text is, it would form a far less lively book without this consummate, diverse and colourful graphic enrichment.Putting both together, this is a splendid celebration. It may be an unusually large slab of non-fiction for the average teenager, but those with the appetite for it will be amply rewarded."
47,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11940616-james,5,"I don't think I can put it any better than the quote from Ricky Gervais on the back of this book:""I wanted to write this book, but I wasn't smart enough. Now that I've read it, I am.""This is an excellent book even for those who like me, were generally familiar with most of the concepts tackled within it already. The trick to knowing whether you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them understand it too. Before reading this book I'm not sure I could have done that, but now I'm pretty sure I can.The Magic of Reality is, as Dawkins describes in it's opening pages, an explanation of some of the most genuinely awe-inspiring things that science has discovered about both our world and the universe. From the first chapter on what exactly reality is (not as easy a concept as it appears) to it's final chapter entitled ""What is a miracle?"" (containing some well designed examples that link up neatly with the opening), it guides the reader through several concepts and discoveries including, but not limited to: who the first person was (spoiler: there wasn't one), why we have winter and summer (which was something I thought I knew but was completely wrong about), how the universe began and the misconception of asking why bad things happen.Most chapters open with some charming and interesting myths from various human tribes and civilisations throughout history about the subject that the chapter itself tackles. This is not only to show just what the human brain is capable of inventing (and believing), but to show that no matter what stories we may invent, the truth of what is really happening is far more enticing.Read it."
48,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10901897-alastair,2,"Whilst I would not dare to fault Dawkins' science, to describe his grasp of the role of myth and story in social evolution as 'limited' would, yet again, be generous. Philip Pullman is quoted in the cover: 'The clearest and most beautifully written introduction to science I've ever read.' Perhaps Mr Pullman read a pre-publication edition in which the writing wasn't dominated by a 1950's avuncular style, peppered with complex concepts and language, the understanding of which is assumed. Also to call this an introduction to science is, surely, to have misunderstood its purpose: demytholigisation. A task which I would actually have little problem with, were it not for the patronizingly simplistic approach to the myths themselves. Having said, that, the book is on my shelf (Dave McKean's illustrations, alone, make it worth keeping) and I will use it as a prompt for further thought on narrative approaches to the world - I will just have to fight the temptation to hurl it at the wall every six or so pages. "
49,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1026591-christian-mckay,2,"Hmm . . . Okay, let's get this out of the way first. Dave McKean's art is, as always, on point. It's worth the price of admission. I do find it strange to see a man, who brought so many of Neil Gaiman's fantastical works to life, turn around and help another guy DISPROVE FAIRIES FOR SOME REASON. But he's unbelievably good at lending visuals to big ideas. His illustrations of the myths Dawkins is shitting all over are just as captivating as his illustrations of scientific principles.Dawkins' prose is clear and concise, if a little stuffy. This is a perfectly fine refresher on the basics of the scientific laws that govern our universe. But when it comes to the beliefs of ""primitive"" people, he becomes patronizing, as if he's convinced that if he lived in ancient times, he would have solved the rules of the universe no problem. K, bro. And he sneakily weaves in his moralistic atheism throughout. I don't have a problem with atheism, but eh, it feels misplaced here.Finally, I'm confused as to who this is for. It's written like it's for children, but in a weighty package that feels better suited for adults. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I think I learned something new once every thirty pages or so. You'll know pretty early whether or not this book is for you."
50,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,4,"After a long period of time I picked up Dawkins's work and it was indeed a delightful reading. Though largely the book is catering to younger audiences but still has learning for all ages. He delves into the magic of reality which is indeed the science. Here is an opening to the book:-"" The third meaning of magic is the one I mean in my title: poetic magic. We are moved to tears by a beautiful piece of music and we describe the performance as ‘magical’. We gaze up at the stars on a dark night with no moon and no city lights and, breathless with joy, we say the sight is ‘pure magic’. We might use the same word to describe a gorgeous sunset, or an alpine landscape, or a rainbow against a dark sky. In this sense, ‘magical’ simply means deeply moving, exhilarating: something that gives us goose bumps, something that makes us feel more fully alive. What I hope to show you in this book is that reality – the facts of the real world as understood through the methods of science – is magical in this third sense, the poetic sense, the good to be alive sense."" Throughout the book there is immense amount of discussion on evolution. Evolution through natural selection is indeed one of the greatest ideas propounded and ofcourse established through ample evidences. Also Dawkins takes digs at various myths and religions and this is expected from the author."
51,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27781063-dyary-abubakr,4,"Magic is a slippery word:  Dawkins wrote it is commonly used in three different ways, and the first thing I must do is distinguish between them. I'll call the first one 'supernatural magic', the second one 'stage magic' and the third one (which is my favourite meaning, and the one I intend in my title) 'poetic magic' What I hope to show you in this book is that reality – the facts of the real world as understood through the methods of science – is magical in this third sense, the poetic sense, the good to be alive sense... the kind I call poetic magic: an inspiring beauty which is all the more magical because it is real and because we can understand how it works. This book, which has twelve chapters and each chapter starts with a question, a simple question that one day myths have been created to explain it, a question like "" Why are there so many different kinds of animal? may has many myths trying to explain them, and that's what dawkins shows in every chapter, he shows you the myths that have been created to explain a natural phenomenon, they may be cute, delightful, fun , but not real and that's what dawkins is trying to show, he is trying to show whats really real, by only science , science is the way to find answers to these questions, and when we do, when we finally know the answer the nature you normally see becomes a magic, a magic of reality."
52,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,2,"I didn't like the approach of this book. I liked the God Delusion and I liked some of his other books on evolution especially The Greatest Show on Earth, but this one is kind of a bad combo of the two. He basically pits Religious and Mythical tradition against ""the Magic of Science and the reality of Nature"". Whether he meant to do that or not this is definitely the way it comes across and I think this is a terrible approach. I am a great lover of reading religion and mythical tradition for what it teaches us about people, about history and about civilized thought. I also believe that you don't frankly need to pit anything against nature and science to see the beauty of it. They both have intrinsically fascinating qualities and bring people a lot of joy and happiness in the experience. Whether or not you believe myths/religions as actual truth I think is somewhat irrelevant, they are still valuable to culture, tradition, and interactions with other people, in finding the way that shapes human thought. I just didn't like the way he went about the subject/topic at all in this book. I thought it a bit in poor taste frankly. "
53,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I enjoy reading and learning about myths. I devour a good ghost story. I actively seek out tales of the supernatural. But I also believe that the greatest magic of all is the magic of reality, and for that reason, I love science.This was a library copy, but after reading, it's one I'll purchase if only so I can have it around for the kids to thumb through. In fact, it is written in such a basic and easily digestible format that I am considering using in my home school curriculum.This beautifully illustrated celebration of science and its role in solving the mysteries of the unknown will likely appeal to readers who appreciate that things don't have to be unexplainable to be magical. It's not so much that there is anything new here for the science reader. It's somewhat basic. But it does succeed at reminding us that not knowing isn't a justification for making things up. Most science lovers already know this, still it was fun(and somewhat poignant) to read the myths people created before we found the answers. It's clear that as far as we come, we've got a long, long way to go."

Richard Dawkins’ aim is to promote rationalism and the scientific method (i.e. proposing a model and then testing it), rejecting myths and the supernatural. Hence, he addresses key issues such as: the evolution of species and natural selection, organic chemistry and Carbon based life, atoms (“what things are made of”), rainbows and the dispersion of light, the nature (and evolution) of stars, planets, galaxies, and the universe…But don’t be afraid to read this book! In spite of the great complexity of these issues, it is EASY to read.Frankly, I read Richard Dawkins’ “Magic of Reality” with pleasure; is it because I’m the daughter of a physicist? I do not know… but I recommend it strongly."
55,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Another excellent book by Dawkins narrated by him & Lalla Ward, one of my favorite narrating teams. Dawkins covers a lot of basic science with its history. He tells a few of the legends about what various peoples around the globe have thought about natural phenomena & how science has found out what really takes place. It really is magical, in a poetic sense & he shows that very well. The universe is a fascinating place with a lot of questions remaining to be answered.He doesn't beat on religion too much in this book beyond pointing out how its explanations have been superseded by scientific discoveries. If you know someone who isn't well educated in science & wants to know a bit more, this is a great book to give them. That includes kids from about 12 & up. Dawkins is very clear & concise in his explanations. Highly recommended.Table of Contents:1. What is reality? What is magic?2. Who was the first person?3. Why are there so many different kinds of animals?4. What are things made of?5. Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?6. What is the sun?7. What is a rainbow?8. When and how did everything begin?9. Are we alone?10. What is an earthquake?11. Why do bad things happen?12. What is a miracle?"
56,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7006637-santhosh,4,"The book covers a lot of basic science topics in brief, serving as a good, clear, basic introduction to evolution, natural selection, genetics, molecular physics, cosmology, astronomy, plate tectonics and probability. While the stated audience for this book is 12-year olds, I would say it also makes a good read for intelligent adults whose science grounding is poor. The biggest current danger isn't kids not getting some education, but rather growing up into adults who falsely believe in religious dogma and wrongly assign the role of science only to laboratories and inventions - only to scientists. Adults would also do well to brush up their knowledge of the basics of our world and how these basics interact and add-up into the larger picture. To that order, this is an excellent book, one that I can ask anyone to be comfortable with first if they want to make conversation to me at the bar.As to be expected, Dawkins is in his element when speaking about his pet subject: evolutionary biology, where he draws a vivid and clear walk-through on evolution. The pieces on atoms and the forces that govern their world, speculations on extra-terrestrial life, cosmology, plate tectonics, and probability as related to 'life just is' are all excellent at what the essays set out to do: explain what they are. Overall, Dawkins is able to provide a simple and broken-down explanation of each of the topics, covering them from the individual components to the overall picture. I just wish Carl Sagan had been somehow involved in this, as he would have added his badly missed passion and child-like sense of wonder when explaining science - something which would have helped immensely to make this book, otherwise a little dry, more enjoyable.To me, Dawkins came across as fighting demons in his head while writing this book, by directing his answers toward an imagined audience holding on to their unscientific beliefs. The book thus comes across as a little contemptuous and confronting in its tone, which instead of being mildly mocking as intended, comes across as petulant and irksome while reading. For example, I'm sure that Dawkins understands what mythology is and its role in social evolution. To disdainfully table all of mythology as ignorant ramblings meant only to provide explanations of a particular natural phenomena is to underestimate and subvert the intelligence of our ancestors.In summary, an excellent idea behind the book, and in large parts follows through in the delivery as well."
57,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6068530-jim-whitefield,5,"Armed with the foreknowledge that this book is written to appeal to quite young readers as well as other ages, you will not feel Dawkins is as condescending in tone as you might otherwise be drawn to conclude. In my opinion, he does a marvellous job of writing in a fashion that will entertain and retain the interest of youngsters, whilst at the same time enthralling those of us who are of a much older generation. Beautifully illustrated throughout and with numerous wonderful photos as well, the book covers a dozen chapters on the reality of various interesting scientific aspects within which Dawkins also cunningly intertwines myths and legends surrounding them, including quite naturally, many biblical myths and legends which he phrases in ways that make them laughable rather than remotely plausible. Atheism permeates the book in a manner which is very hard to refute. He makes his readers 'think'. He is extremely adept at putting things into (simple) scientific perspective. He includes myths in pretty much every chapter, apart from the one on things so small you can't see them - and as he explains, there are no myths about them because, in terms of the evolution of human knowledge, until relatively recently, no one knew about them, so there are no myths or legends about them... simple when you think! He includes some internet links to YouTube material which are interesting, except unfortunately, the first one comes up with a notice that it is no longer available because of ""multiple third-party notifications of copyright infringement"" which is a shame as I am sure the publishers felt they had covered that. Perhaps it will get sorted out. Overall, whilst I already knew quite a lot of the things he talks about, even so, there was much I learned and I found the whole experience like being a young teenager again, learning from the best books, in the most interesting and informative - not to mention easy to understand - way imaginable. Well done Richard - I hope there will be more of these. Kids deserve such knowledge and perspective while they are as young as possible. This book should form part of the education curriculum worldwide. For me, this is yet another 'must read'. Brilliant."
58,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"I'm not entirely sure why I still read Dawkins' work. I think he's an extremely intelligent person, of course, and I've enjoyed reading books that focus on science by him -- I love The Ancestor's Tale, for example. But I hate the way that he cannot stop poking at religion, and I expected to hate it even more in a book called The Magic of Reality.Actually, he's more respectful than usual. It all seems rather toned down, since it's aimed at a younger audience than his other books (which is somewhat insulting in itself; I read and understood The Ancestor's Tale perfectly at the age of thirteen, and this book is aimed at 'ages twelve and up', I'm told). It can come across as condescending, though I rather appreciated the parts where he admits he doesn't know everything. It is accessible, for people of any age and any level of knowledge about science, covering basic topics like why we have seasons and what earthquakes are. It's quite enjoyable to read even though I don't think I learnt anything new, because it clarified things and connected ideas.He is, of course, scathing about religion and dismissive of any belief in the supernatural, but if you're planning to read Dawkins, you probably know that already."

With its lovely illustrations and clear explanations, it's an amazing gift for children.I didn't include adults because I assume they already know these basic facts of science. In reality though, I've encountered people, even some college graduates who don't know these basic stuff. And, frankly, I find it astonishing that many adults either don't know anything about or care about science. I'm not talking about rocket science. I'm talking about the fundamental questions of where we come from, our evolution, the planet we live on, what are stuff made of ... Generally things any conscious being should be interested in. We are incredibly lucky to know much more, and to have some exciting answers to these old questions. In my opinion, it's one of the great privileges we have compared to our early ancestors and indeed the rest of life on this earth that come and go without ever knowing the reason for their existence. Anyway, that's it for my rant. The point is, go get this book for any young person in your life because there's nothing grander than the Magic of Reality! ;)"

The book was released on 15 September 2011 in the United Kingdom, and on 4 October 2011 in the United States. It is a graphic science book aimed primarily at children and young adults. Dawkins has stated that the book is intended for those aged around 12 years and upwards, and that when trialling the book prior to publishing, younger readers were able to understand its content with additional adult assistance.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هجدهم ماه فوریه سال 2017 میلادیعنوان: جادوی واقعیت، چطور میدانیم چه چیزی واقعا درست است؟؛ نویسنده: ریچارد داوکینز (داکینز)؛ تصویرگر: دیو مک‌کین؛ ترجمه و تنظیم: مینا خبوشانی، ویراستار: آرش حسینیان؛ ناشر: اینترنتی، 1392؛ فهرست کتاب: یک: واقعیت چیست؟ دو: اولین انسان چه کسی بود؟ سه: تنوع گونه‌ های جانوری به چه دلیل است؟ چهار: چیزها از چه ساخته شده‌ اند؟ پنج: چرا شب و روز، تابستان و زمستان داریم؟ شش: خورشید چیست؟ هفت: رنگین کمان چیست؟ هشت: چیزها چه زمانی و چگونه آغاز شدند؟ نه: آیا ما تنها هستیم؟ ده: زلزله چیست؟ یازده: چرا چیزهای بد اتفاق می‌افتند؟ دوازده: معجزه چیستبرخلاف کتاب ساعت‌ساز نابینا؛ و ژن خودخواه؛ که برای مخاطبان نسبتا سطح بالا نوشته شده، این‌بار قلم «ریچارد داکینز(داوکینز)» دارای زبانی ساده است و گویا، همگان آن را میفهمند. ایشان اینبار تلاش می‌کنند، تا شگفتی‌های علم را توضیح دهند. «ریچارد داوکینز»، مشهورترین زیست‌ شناس تکاملی با همکاری «دیو مک‌کین» هنرمند برجسته ی طراحی، با به‌ کارگیری نوشتار، و تصاویر گرافیکی، یکی از زیباترین و خواناترین کتاب‌های علمی عمومی را گردآوری کرده‌ اند. کتاب «جادوی واقعیت»، پاسخهایی ساده به پرسش‌هایی دشوار است. در این کتاب، «داکینز» کوشش می‌کنند، با ترکیب عقلانیت و شواهد موجود، پاسخی درست به پرسشها ارائه دهند. مسائلی که «داکینز» طرح می‌کنند، هم برای بزرگسالان جالب است و هم مورد علاقه ی نوجوانان است. مثلا در بخش نخستین: انسان چه کسی بود، نویسنده که خود از طرفداران فرگشت است، با بیانی ساده و جذاب نحوه ی فرگشت (تکامل) را شرح می‌دهد. یا مثلا در بخش: خورشید چیست، از داستان اسطوره‌ ها آغاز می‌کنند، و نهایتا به این می‌رسند که خورشید نه یک خدا، که یک ستاره است! نکته کتاب اینجاست، که تنها به علم زیست‌ شناسی (تخصص خود داکینز) و فرگشت محدود نمی‌شود. از فیزیک تا نجوم بحث می‌شوند. به‌ نوعی می‌توان گفت «ریچارد داکینز» سعی دارند در «جادوی واقعیت»، عقاید خرافی را از منطق علمی پاک کنند. ا. شربیانی"
61,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"To be sure, I need to be clear as to WHY I like this book. It's not like any of the science or reasoning in it is new or unusual, or that I haven't heard many similar reasonings here or there all the way from high school physics courses all the way to certain and strange movies I've enjoyed.Why I do love this book is simple: it's clear, concise, and it does a very admirable job of setting up magical thinking in all its flavors against the fundamentals of science.It's a great primer. I think I would have loved reading this when I was 13 or 14. It might have even sparked my interest in science even more than I had been sparked... but that might not be possible. Science Fiction did a perfectly admirable job in that department, with Heinlein and Asimov as my tutors.Even so, apart from the things I've heard about of Dawkins, this is relatively mild in the religion bashing. He uses logic and reasoning, postulating clearly and setting up the universe as it is, not as we wish it would be. He also makes sure that Occam's Razor is quite sharp.I certainly have no complaints about this book, assuming I wanted a basic primer, of course.As for being an adult reading this? It's charming. It's somewhat magical in the sense that I draw a sense of wonder about the universe and our living within it. For that alone I would recommend it as a bit of light reading, assuming you're up to your science snuff. :)"
62,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,5,"A surprising number of scientists feel that Richard Dawkins does the public understanding of science real harm through his belligerent attacks on religion, which turn off a good half of his potential audience, but no one can doubt that he has a talent for getting science, particularly biology, across to a general readership. This is his first attempt at a children's book (or rather a 'family' book as it is aimed at a wider readership) and it has much to praise.The Magic of Reality is a solid feeling hardback, half way between an ordinary non-fiction book and a coffee table book in format. Every page is illustrated by Dave McKean, with a mix of full colour photographs and diagrams, and heavily stylised line drawings - these last were perhaps a little angular and abstract for the younger audience, but overall the illustration is a good balance of supporting the text without overwhelming the page.The approach that Dawkins takes is an excellent one, picking up on ten key questions of science - 'What is reality? Who was the first person? Why are there so many different kinds of animals? What are things made of? Why do we have night and day, winter and summer? What is the sun? What is a rainbow? When and how did everything begin? Are we alone? and What is an Earthquake?' Each of these starts with ancient mythical explanations (where there are any) then goes on to detail the way that science answers the questions, using the starting point of the basic question to explore many different aspects of science that can be sensibly linked to it.All this works superbly well. Although it seems slightly odd that biology comes before the more fundamental physics and cosmology chapters, the absolute gem of the book (as you might expect) is the way that Dawkins handles 'Who was the first person?' His use of a stack of photographs, stretching back into the past, one of each generation, is masterful, inventive and wonderfully eye-opening. I love the way he really pushes the paradox that every creature in every generation is the same species as the previous generation's photograph - yet over the millions of years we can see a progression from fish-like creature to modern human. If ever there was a single bit of writing that could totally wipe out anyone's objections to evolution it's this chapter. I loved it. It will really challenge the readers to think and will open their eyes.However, it's important not to let the brilliance of much of the book hide a couple of significant flaws. In terms of science content, the huge disappointment is that Dawkins doesn't mention much modern physics. Both quantum theory and relativity really don't get any coverage. Particle physics only gets a passing reference with a wimp-out about the author not really understanding quarks. This isn't good enough. Omitting quantum theory and relativity from physics is like missing evolution out of biology - it's that significant an omission.The other problem I have is with the final two chapters. Because there aren't 10 questions, there are 12. The remaining two are 'Why do bad things happen?' and 'What is a miracle.' The first of these isn't too bad as it handles chance, but both are primarily Dawkins returning to his bugbear of attacking religion. I don't think this has a place in a science book, and it certainly shouldn't be given two chapters. I think this will confuse and quite probably bore younger readers, as after all the other wonders, these two chapters are, frankly, lacking in scientific joy. There is also one very dubious part. Dawkins suggests that readers use a method of assessing miracles that boils down to 'How do they stand up to common sense?' The trouble with this approach is much of modern physics doesn't fit with what common sense predicts. For that matter, most probability runs counter to common sense. As Dawkins himself points out, common sense expects that after a row of throwing heads, a coin is more likely to throw tails - but common sense gets it wrong. It seems highly spurious to use common sense as a scientific tool, when you've just shown it fails magnificently.I still think this is a great book, and I suspect many young readers will simply not bother with the last couple of chapters. Covering all of science is tricky, but despite the failings in physics, the rest of the book is good enough to make this, without doubt, one of the best children's science books of 2011.(Review originally posted on www.popularscience.co.uk - reproduced with permission)"
63,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,5,"I am still sizzling with delight over my latest Dawkins' read - having soaked up its information like a hungry sponge. It leaves the reader totally awed and dazzled with the world. I’m humming with it. The birds (plump with protons and neurons, atoms and molecules) are singing louder than ever in the garden, and that amazingly mysterious and wonderful star that we call the sun, (roaring away converting hydrogen to helium), shines even more brilliantly in the blue sky as we make a sedate path round it's circumference, twirling round and round on our axis at a giddy rate of 1000 miles per hour. Thank goodness for the stickiness of gravity, and Mother Earth's determination to keep us clasped to her bosom. Ahhhhh ...this book has made me so happy. At last, a book giving a fantastic overview of science that I can easily understand. I obviously have the science age of a 12 year old (the age group that everyone says the book is geared towards....)Something is wrong in my lauding of this book though. Dawkins wouldn’t like it. The term ""Mother Earth"" smacks of anthropomorphism, and he ain’t having any of it. In fact a good fifth of the book is dedicated to the recounting of various myths from around the world – including what he considers the Christian myth - and at the end of every segment on myths Dawkins goes on to show how science is better. Much much better than myth.In fact I mentioned I was reading this book to a neighbour, and he said “Yeah, Dawkins – that’s the guy who keeps banging on against God.” To have a scientist and communicator of the calibre of Dawkins referred to in those terms is I think terrible, but he has bought it upon himself. He just cannot live and let live. In fact I have changed my mind about what I said in the above paragraph... I have since read the Wikipedia article on Creationism (see the paragraphs headed ""Creationism internationally""). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CreationismGiven the large number of people who support the idea of Creationism - it is very good that Dawkins is arguing against it..... But I still don't like a lot of his other criticisms and quips against religion.

Taken from Richard Dawkins.net. Anyway, to get back to the science. This book is a.m.a.z.i.n.g. I learnt tons, and loved every minute of reading it. The chapters have headings which speak for themselves…and also illustrate well the age group Dawkins is appealing to.*Who was the first person?*Why are there so many different kinds of animals?*What are things made of?*Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?*What is the sun?*What is a rainbow?*When and how did everything begin?*Are we alone?*What is an earthquake?There isn’t one single diagram in the book. He does it all with words - but he is an incredibly brilliant writer, and it is utterly memorable and fascinating. Time and time again he wrote about things that I'd previously only half understood, and made them crystal clear. I feel hugely grateful to him. Highly recommended."
64,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4149976-emily,3,"I'm a big fan of Dawkins ever since reading The Selfish Gene many many years ago. However, I was very disppointed in this book, which is so basic that it shouldn't contain surprises for anyone who graduated from high school. There were no surprises and nothing really new - the most interesting part for me was how each chapter is introduced with an example of a myth that people have made up to explain some natural phenomenon, which the rest of the chapter then explains. I found the majority of it plodding, basic, and disappointing.HOWEVER ... on looking over some of the other reviews on Goodreads, I see several people saying this book is intended for younger readers. There was nothing at all in the book's description on Audible that indicated this. However, if that's the case then it's a good, clear, basic introduction for a kid around 8-12 years old. On that basis I'll give it 3 stars. As an adult book, which was my expectation of it, it was very basic stuff and came across rather condescending quite a lot of the time. Marks against the publisher for not making the intended audience extremely clear in the summary."
65,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1789091-noah,3,"I live in the United States in the 21st century. There is no greater danger to our species and our civilization right now than religious crazies. How can we ask our businesses to change the way they do business so as to prevent climate change if half of the country doesn't believe in scientific evidence? Or worse yet, if they expect a big bearded man to come down and bail us out if things get too bad?What about the people who believe that the world will end, in the next few years, with a war in the Middle East? What if their faith leads them to believe we should go to war to make this come about?Yes, these are scary people and there are a lot of them.I'd like to think that Mr. Dawkins had these people in mind when he wrote this book. It may be too late for the current generation who have turned their minds off and handed over their rational thought in exchange for ""faith."" But perhaps the next generation can be saved in time, and with their help we CAN actually do the work necessary to make the world a better place?From that perspective, this is an important and incredible book. It is a blow struck for logic over foolishness.But all the way through, I did find myself having mixed feelings. I don't think Mr. Dawkins really understands the purpose of the old myths and legends. The distinction between fairy tales and mythology seems to be missing from his understanding. When the old stories about the ""gods"" and nature of reality were written, they were neither meant to be ""just so stories"" nor were all of them intended to take the place of science. While he chooses to use the myths throughout his book to make his own book more entertaining, he clearly looks down on them and shows no consciousness that there is a deeper level of meaning to be found in mythology: the realm of the psychological. I would suggest he sit down and re-read his Joseph Campbell. The mythological creation of the world, the end of the world, the nature of mythological reality was never meant to be science. It was often meant to represent the internal journey of mankind.On page 202 he writes, ""We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories: we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy."" Why do we need to keep our imaginations in line? Can't we mature to the point at which we are able to partake in scientific investigation on Mondays and mythological investigation on Wednesdays? Can't we be trusted to learn the difference and keep them apart?Science cannot help us with questions of existence. It will never help us with ""How ought I act?"" or ""What meaning can I find in my life?"" ""What happens after we die?"" ""How can I find happiness?"" But perhaps the ancient knowledge, allied with philosophy, can be of some use with these (more important) problems?There are snide remarks here and there aimed at Astrology, aliens, and such. He may be right about many of them, but the attacks lack any logical depth.Overall, I would certainly recommend this book to any and all children of the right reading level, but I would also want to talk to that child as they were reading it. Maybe take them for a walk in the woods and teach them about talking to the trees. There certainly is more in the world we actually experience than is dreamnt of in Mr. Dawkins' science.Dave McKean, as always, is a master. His artwork is well worth the price of the book all by itself. He gets 16 stars. "
66,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12885473-darian-onaciu,5,"As a wee child - no, I'm not Scottish, I just like how 'wee' sounds - I was introverted and could rarely feel at ease while playing with other children.Unfortunately that was a problem because, being human, I also didn't enjoy being left out of activities. All that changed when I discovered the magic of reading books - no, I didn't turn into a robot from the Dungeon Dimensions.Now, don't get me wrong, I wasn't a hermit and got my periodic dose of socialization - yup, sounds cringeworthy - it's just that I felt more at ease with a book because I could travel to new worlds, identify with heroes and villains, see with my mind's eye fictitious or real wonders - yup, way more entertaining than the games children usually play.While in secondary school I started with reading folk and fairy tales and at some point got to a book whose title would be loosely translated as The Legends of the Olympus.I liked it a lot and started wondering about truth, gods, superpowers and religions - you know, as all children do at some point.So I started asking questions and the more answers I received, being born in a country where more than 80% are orthodox, the more I was convinced that one of the best ways someone could get closer to the Truth and be able to better understand the world around us would be to become a priest.Being a respectable goal to pursue, my mother and grandparents, although none were regular churchgoers, encouraged me to do so. So I picked up a Bible and started reading it, only to discover it was full of metaphors and words that as a child I couldn't understand - so I got bored and put it down, nonetheless retaining my faith in a higher power.Years passed by and after the 8th grade national exam I got in at a very good high-school in my small town, in a class with a STEM specialization focusing on Information Technology and Mathematics.I was the odd duck from the class who excelled at English - foreign language - and Romanian - the national language of the country I was born in. I wrote poems depicting my teenage angst and some short prose - speaking of which, I'm sure I'd get a good laugh if I'd discover my 'writings'.I still liked to read but my reading habits, as far as I can remember, just exited the era of Jules Verne's works and gravitated towards books like Oliver Twist, White Fang, Robinson Crusoe and so on. But my reading habits were about to change due to a totally unexpected factor: my new girlfriend. We were classmates and she was a rare combo: one of the smartest and cutest - the best, if you're perchance reading this review (she liked to argue a lot). She was way better than me in STEM but I had the edge in humanities. She introduced me to J. K. Rowling, Frank Herbert, Carl Sagan and more.I really looked up to her.So when she told me she was an atheist and I told her I was a believer, well, the two hormonal teenage universes clashed and although I can't exactly remember, there is about a 100% chance we had an expletive filled fight about it.But with all our differences we cared about each other and continued being together for a few years.More than her looks and academic smarts I appreciated the books we shared and her astuteness in conversation.We talked about anything and everything debating pros and cons. It didn't matter if the subject was asinine or something crucially important like 'would someone after being subjected to teleportation be the same person or merely a clone of the original?'She pushed me out of my comfort zone, stretched my mind and I loved her for it.But belief was a touchy subject. Although I went to church only at special occasions throughout the year, I considered myself a believer. But I also considered myself a smart person who liked to read and ask questions to better understand the Universe.But what if those questions started to elicit uncomfortable emotions?Which identity would prevail then?Questions like: ""Why is there more than one religion?""""How can you tell that you believe in the right one?""""Wouldn't the time of your existence in history, the place you were born in and/or your parents influence your choice of religion more than your free will?""""If there is a God then why are bad things happening to good people?"" and so on.Had it been out then, this book would have been the perfect gift for me.In fact, if I could travel back in time I'd gift it to my secondary school self - though I'm sure he would only partially understand it - then travel a bit forward and hand it to my high school self.Be a kind person and gift this book to people who are curious and like to ask questions.I had to realize on my own through reading books, having interesting conversations and just plain living, that people are creatures of habit, that we act more on an emotional than logical basis, that there are a throng of cognitive biases which continuously incapacitate our decision making and obstruct our evolution. And make no mistake, changing one's mind is strictly a personal journey. But should we tolerate our faults by recognizing our limitations we can make tremendous progress and see the beauty of the Universe not through n interpretations of unchanging ancient texts but through the lens of the only incrementally self actualizing instrument: science.Jesus, this turned out to be a bit personal."

Dawkins made it quite fun, most parts of this book aren’t boring at all. The way he narrated this book is really humble, he isn’t patronized us the reader, and he admitted that he still didn’t understand some part and somehow made himself equal to the reader (of course he isn’t).However, i found a few other parts of the book is a little bit boring. Like the atom part, the explanation is quite long.I found many interesting information in this book like how to measure time in fossils with radioactive clocks using uranium-238, sun and it’s mythology, and also the question i’ve always wanted to know : who is the first person on earth? And the idea that auto immune disease could be a weapon to fight cancer is really fascinating. This book ends with my favorite chapter about several miracles and the possibility that really happened at that time. Well done, Dawkins. I would totally read all of your books."
68,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74466071-charlie-hasler,5,"I enjoyed this read very much. I have read The God Delusion but that is the only other Dawkins book I have read.I enjoy Dawkins ""right between the eyes"" style of writing. This is a superb read, very interesting and complicated science is broken down so even knuckle draggers like me can understand it."
69,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18959010-nihal-vrana,1,"This was the worst popular science book that I have read. It was lazily-written with no real structure rather than flimsy chapter beginnings with myths. The information in it was extremely random and superficial. I'm sorry to say this but it is nothing more than a rant of a famous person than a popular science book with an aim to inform its audience. I used to enjoy Dawkins' books back in the day; when they were about topics which he has a good grasp of (i.e. evolution). But I really don't like what he has become since then, a figurehead basically who does not refrain from giving his opinion on any topic at all. For example, his ""speculation"" about auto-immune diseases in the book shows that he really did not understand them very well, yet it did not stop him from talking about them. The beauty of science is that it never really needs to defend itself. The proofs it comes up with always speak for themselves. When you understand them thoroughly, you will be convinced anyway. So the science does not need ""Champions"", it convinces by evidence. But somehow over the last 10 years, Mr. Dawkins became a self-proclaimed champion of science which, as a professional researcher, irks me. The language, content and style of this book added to my dislike of him as a popular figure."
70,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1575042-antonia,3,"Great book: clear and accessible (not sure of the best age group, though). Kids are naturally curious and fascinated by how the world works. They're also susceptible to all kinds of nonsense, of course. This much-needed book fill s a gap between simplistic kids' books and adult science books. Also, we need books that help kids understand, not just the facts of the world, but how we know them and, more generally, how do we know whether something's true or not? And I should think this book would be invaluable to parents, a good many of whom could probably not explain natural selection, DNA, plate tectonics, or probability.Where else could one find so much in one book? And the illustrations by Dave McKean are astonishing —though somewhat overwhelming. Sometimes too large and distracting. I don't like the weirdly formatted titles with mixed, funky fonts in different colors and sizes (within the same title, that is). But that's me.I couldn't tell what age group he's addressing. I read somewhere that he's said about age 12 and up. But sometimes he sounds he's talking to six-year-olds. At other times, he uses terms like ""the scientific method."" Huh, what? The tone bugged me all the way through. The best children's books are those that don't talk down, that adults can enjoy just as much as a 12-year-old. I didn't (always) find that to be true of this one. I had some mixed feelings about the content, though — not the scientific content, but the way he makes fun of myths, etc. Okay, they're not literally true, but. . . . There's a difference between fairytales and mythology. As another Goodreads reviewer (Noah) has said: ""When the old stories about the ""gods"" and nature of reality were written, they were neither meant to be ""just so stories"" nor were all of them intended to take the place of science.."" The tone bothered me a bit, too. I didn't care for the authorial intrusion. Noah also quotes Dawkins here: ""We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories: we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy."" Noah then asks, ""Why do we need to keep our imaginations in line?"" Good point. ""Science . . . will never help us with ""How ought I act?"" or ""What meaning can I find in my life?"" . . . ""How can I find happiness?"" But perhaps the ancient knowledge, allied with philosophy, can be of some use with these problems. . . . ""I have no sense at all of how kids would respond to this (don't have any). I would love to see this book reviewed by some 12-year-olds.Apparently, there's a very cool iPad version, which I haven't seen. "

72,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-again,4,"A good dose of reality for any youngster patient enough to read it. It's written in a style that is meant to help early adolescents make sense of the things they've been taught, and determine which ones are fact-based. It's a nice introduction to critical thinking, with a lot of science, a little history, and a smattering of myth. Be prepared to have your religious teachings challenged. This IS Richard Dawkins, after all."

It would help my ""reviewer cred"". Thanks and enjoy this wonderful book.The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True by Richard Dawkins""The Magic of Reality"" is the latest contribution by evolutionary-biologist icon Richard Dawkins. Professor Dawkins is on a mission of education and in this enlightening book he reaches a younger audience by introducing science like only he can. In one of the most beautifully illustrated science books, he takes the reader on a ride on a wide-range of topics of interest that masterfully navigates between myth and what is real. This mesmerizing 272-page book is composed of the following twelve chapters: 1. What is reality? What is magic? , 2. Who was the first person? , 3. Why are there so many different kinds of animals? , 4. What are things made of? , 5. Why do we have night and day, winter and summer? , 6. What is the sun? , 7. What is a rainbow? , 8. When and how did everything begin? , 9. Are we alone? , 10. What is an earthquake? , 11. Why do bad things happen? ,and 12. What is a miracle?Positives: 1. A wonderful book on science that is accessible to a younger audience without compromising the science lovers in all of us. Bravo! 2. It's a book written by the great Richard Dawkins, so you know the quality goes in before the product goes out. 3. A true labor of love. The educator in Professor Dawkins comes out and now even our children will benefit from his prodigious knowledge. 4. One of the most beautifully illustrated books you will ever find. Great quality binding only matched by its substance. 5. Science knowledge conveyed in a brilliant, lucid manner. 6. Great format. In each chapter, Professor Dawkins illustrates clearly the difference between the wishful and what is ""really"" real. 7. What a wonderful way to learn about science. Great practical examples throughout this beautiful book. A ride of knowledge, hop on! Readers of all ages will enjoy this great book. 8. Even-handed and pleasant tone throughout. 9. A wide range of fascinating science topics in the hands of the master. 10. Great wisdom throughout, ""We should always be open-minded, but the only good reason to believe that something exists is if there is real evidence that it does"". 11. The book cleverly goes from myth to reality. 12. The concept of magic in three tiers: supernatural, stage and poetic. 13. Evolution in the hands of the master. Awesome. 14. Was there ever a first person? Insightful indeed. The best illustrated example I've ever read. 15. Great explanation on DNA. 16. Clever examples throughout, one of the many strengths of this book. 17. A wide range of fascinating science topic in the hands of a master. 18. The three common phases of matter. 19. The importance of the scientific meyhod. 20. The concept of empty space...I finally get it. 21. The importance of carbons, organic chemistry. 22. Telling that there are no myths to describe atoms... 23. So what causes the difference between winter and summer...find out. 24. The illusion of relative movement. 25. The great Isaac Newton. Gravity, lights...we are not worthy. 26. The difference between mass and weight. 27. A great illustration of how far stars are from us. 28. How coal is created. 29.

How we determine age. 38. Spectral barcoders...neat. 39. Methods for detecting planets. 40. The keys for life on other planets. 41. Plate tectonics illustrated, wonderful. 42. The speed of continents, sea-floor spreading... 43. Myths debunked. 44. Practical explanation for probability. 45. Great examples of evolution...parasites. 46. How the immune system works. Fascinating. 47. Miracles what they are. 48. David Hume's irrefutable logic regarding miracles and many great examples. 49. Absolutely kindles the fire of learning. 50. An excellent gift for all occasions.Negatives: 1. The book is intended for a younger audience and covers briefly a lot of topics. If you are expecting an in-depth analysis. This is not the book for you. 2. No bibliography.In summary, a fabulous book for all to enjoy. I usually limit my purchases to Kindle books because of the convenience but I'm glad I was ""forced"" to buy this book in hardcover binding. It's a beautiful book inside and out. Substance finally matches style and it's a science book for all to enjoy and for years to come. There is a sense of awe, a poetic magic for reality. For all his knowledge, Professor Dawkins is humbled by what little we do know and how much more we need to find out about the world. It's precisely this drive to know more and that hunger for knowledge that I always wanted to convey to my children. Finally, I have a book that expresses my sentiments and I have Richard Dawkins to thank!"
75,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"In these days it's easy to find factual science and technology books, but books about scientific reasoning are rare, rarer for young readers. I am glad to have found The Magic of Reality : How We Know What's Really True. Richard Dawkins is a British biologist. The book includes 12 chapters. Topics include evolution, natural selection, biology, cosmology and physics, but mostly importantly, what is scientific reasoning and how to tell reality from myth and imaginations.The message is clear: the reality itself is beautiful; it is wonderful to pursue scientific truth; we do not need supernaturals to make us feel special. I think these messages are important and relevant in an age where anti-science and conspiracy theories taking hold of our political and daily life.Richard Dawkins is an atheist and a vocal critic of organized religions. There are several mentions of bible stories but his tone is very mild in this book."
76,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2892211-jason-mills,4,"Dawkins here seeks to enthuse young minds about science: not only with its discoveries but as an approach to the world that is far more thrilling and fascinating - not to say productive - than the idle stories and easy answers of myth and religion. Indeed, it is inherently an encouragement to learn and to challenge one's intellect, rather than to remain ignorant.Each chapter addresses a question about the world: What are things made of? What is a rainbow? Dawkins commences in each case by recounting myths from around the world. He acknowledges that these stories are enjoyable and interesting, but he does not need to work hard to show their inadequacies as explanations. (Dawkins bundles in the myths of current religions with those of ancient or 'minor' ones, which is perfectly legitimate, if a tad mischievous; but he does not hammer the reader over the head with that angle: the word ""atheist"", for instance, does not appear.)Then follows the scientific view of the phenomenon in question, carefully and clearly articulated. Although generally well pitched for an audience entering their teenage years, his prose is sometimes a little demanding:The Chumash people believed that they were created on their island (it obviously wasn't called Santa Cruz then, because that is a Spanish name) from the seeds of a magic plant by the Earth goddess Hutash, who was married to the Sky Snake (what we know as the Milky Way, which you can see on a really dark night in the country, but not if you live in a town where there is too much light pollution).Somebody should have told him not to squeeze two or three sentences into one! Such lapses are rare, however, and the text is a thoroughly engaging read.Of course, it's only half the story. It scarcely does justice to Dave McKean's contribution here to say that he ""illustrated"" The Magic Of Reality: he has designed the book from cover to cover, winding the text in and out of the art, playing visual games, creating pictures in ethnic styles corresponding to the cultures whose myths are under discussion, and eloquently illustrating the scientific ideas. Admirable as the text is, it would form a far less lively book without this consummate, diverse and colourful graphic enrichment.Putting both together, this is a splendid celebration. It may be an unusually large slab of non-fiction for the average teenager, but those with the appetite for it will be amply rewarded."
77,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11940616-james,5,"I don't think I can put it any better than the quote from Ricky Gervais on the back of this book:""I wanted to write this book, but I wasn't smart enough. Now that I've read it, I am.""This is an excellent book even for those who like me, were generally familiar with most of the concepts tackled within it already. The trick to knowing whether you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them understand it too. Before reading this book I'm not sure I could have done that, but now I'm pretty sure I can.The Magic of Reality is, as Dawkins describes in it's opening pages, an explanation of some of the most genuinely awe-inspiring things that science has discovered about both our world and the universe. From the first chapter on what exactly reality is (not as easy a concept as it appears) to it's final chapter entitled ""What is a miracle?"" (containing some well designed examples that link up neatly with the opening), it guides the reader through several concepts and discoveries including, but not limited to: who the first person was (spoiler: there wasn't one), why we have winter and summer (which was something I thought I knew but was completely wrong about), how the universe began and the misconception of asking why bad things happen.Most chapters open with some charming and interesting myths from various human tribes and civilisations throughout history about the subject that the chapter itself tackles. This is not only to show just what the human brain is capable of inventing (and believing), but to show that no matter what stories we may invent, the truth of what is really happening is far more enticing.Read it."
78,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10901897-alastair,2,"Whilst I would not dare to fault Dawkins' science, to describe his grasp of the role of myth and story in social evolution as 'limited' would, yet again, be generous. Philip Pullman is quoted in the cover: 'The clearest and most beautifully written introduction to science I've ever read.' Perhaps Mr Pullman read a pre-publication edition in which the writing wasn't dominated by a 1950's avuncular style, peppered with complex concepts and language, the understanding of which is assumed. Also to call this an introduction to science is, surely, to have misunderstood its purpose: demytholigisation. A task which I would actually have little problem with, were it not for the patronizingly simplistic approach to the myths themselves. Having said, that, the book is on my shelf (Dave McKean's illustrations, alone, make it worth keeping) and I will use it as a prompt for further thought on narrative approaches to the world - I will just have to fight the temptation to hurl it at the wall every six or so pages. "
79,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1026591-christian-mckay,2,"Hmm . . . Okay, let's get this out of the way first. Dave McKean's art is, as always, on point. It's worth the price of admission. I do find it strange to see a man, who brought so many of Neil Gaiman's fantastical works to life, turn around and help another guy DISPROVE FAIRIES FOR SOME REASON. But he's unbelievably good at lending visuals to big ideas. His illustrations of the myths Dawkins is shitting all over are just as captivating as his illustrations of scientific principles.Dawkins' prose is clear and concise, if a little stuffy. This is a perfectly fine refresher on the basics of the scientific laws that govern our universe. But when it comes to the beliefs of ""primitive"" people, he becomes patronizing, as if he's convinced that if he lived in ancient times, he would have solved the rules of the universe no problem. K, bro. And he sneakily weaves in his moralistic atheism throughout. I don't have a problem with atheism, but eh, it feels misplaced here.Finally, I'm confused as to who this is for. It's written like it's for children, but in a weighty package that feels better suited for adults. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I think I learned something new once every thirty pages or so. You'll know pretty early whether or not this book is for you."
80,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,4,"After a long period of time I picked up Dawkins's work and it was indeed a delightful reading. Though largely the book is catering to younger audiences but still has learning for all ages. He delves into the magic of reality which is indeed the science. Here is an opening to the book:-"" The third meaning of magic is the one I mean in my title: poetic magic. We are moved to tears by a beautiful piece of music and we describe the performance as ‘magical’. We gaze up at the stars on a dark night with no moon and no city lights and, breathless with joy, we say the sight is ‘pure magic’. We might use the same word to describe a gorgeous sunset, or an alpine landscape, or a rainbow against a dark sky. In this sense, ‘magical’ simply means deeply moving, exhilarating: something that gives us goose bumps, something that makes us feel more fully alive. What I hope to show you in this book is that reality – the facts of the real world as understood through the methods of science – is magical in this third sense, the poetic sense, the good to be alive sense."" Throughout the book there is immense amount of discussion on evolution. Evolution through natural selection is indeed one of the greatest ideas propounded and ofcourse established through ample evidences. Also Dawkins takes digs at various myths and religions and this is expected from the author."
81,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27781063-dyary-abubakr,4,"Magic is a slippery word:  Dawkins wrote it is commonly used in three different ways, and the first thing I must do is distinguish between them. I'll call the first one 'supernatural magic', the second one 'stage magic' and the third one (which is my favourite meaning, and the one I intend in my title) 'poetic magic' What I hope to show you in this book is that reality – the facts of the real world as understood through the methods of science – is magical in this third sense, the poetic sense, the good to be alive sense... the kind I call poetic magic: an inspiring beauty which is all the more magical because it is real and because we can understand how it works. This book, which has twelve chapters and each chapter starts with a question, a simple question that one day myths have been created to explain it, a question like "" Why are there so many different kinds of animal? may has many myths trying to explain them, and that's what dawkins shows in every chapter, he shows you the myths that have been created to explain a natural phenomenon, they may be cute, delightful, fun , but not real and that's what dawkins is trying to show, he is trying to show whats really real, by only science , science is the way to find answers to these questions, and when we do, when we finally know the answer the nature you normally see becomes a magic, a magic of reality."
82,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,2,"I didn't like the approach of this book. I liked the God Delusion and I liked some of his other books on evolution especially The Greatest Show on Earth, but this one is kind of a bad combo of the two. He basically pits Religious and Mythical tradition against ""the Magic of Science and the reality of Nature"". Whether he meant to do that or not this is definitely the way it comes across and I think this is a terrible approach. I am a great lover of reading religion and mythical tradition for what it teaches us about people, about history and about civilized thought. I also believe that you don't frankly need to pit anything against nature and science to see the beauty of it. They both have intrinsically fascinating qualities and bring people a lot of joy and happiness in the experience. Whether or not you believe myths/religions as actual truth I think is somewhat irrelevant, they are still valuable to culture, tradition, and interactions with other people, in finding the way that shapes human thought. I just didn't like the way he went about the subject/topic at all in this book. I thought it a bit in poor taste frankly. "
83,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I enjoy reading and learning about myths. I devour a good ghost story. I actively seek out tales of the supernatural. But I also believe that the greatest magic of all is the magic of reality, and for that reason, I love science.This was a library copy, but after reading, it's one I'll purchase if only so I can have it around for the kids to thumb through. In fact, it is written in such a basic and easily digestible format that I am considering using in my home school curriculum.This beautifully illustrated celebration of science and its role in solving the mysteries of the unknown will likely appeal to readers who appreciate that things don't have to be unexplainable to be magical. It's not so much that there is anything new here for the science reader. It's somewhat basic. But it does succeed at reminding us that not knowing isn't a justification for making things up. Most science lovers already know this, still it was fun(and somewhat poignant) to read the myths people created before we found the answers. It's clear that as far as we come, we've got a long, long way to go."
84,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36755002-kacey-kells,4,"« We should always be open-minded, but the only good reason to believe that something exists is if there is a real evidence that it does ». Richard Dawkins’ aim is to promote rationalism and the scientific method (i.e. proposing a model and then testing it), rejecting myths and the supernatural. Hence, he addresses key issues such as: the evolution of species and natural selection, organic chemistry and Carbon based life, atoms (“what things are made of”), rainbows and the dispersion of light, the nature (and evolution) of stars, planets, galaxies, and the universe…But don’t be afraid to read this book! In spite of the great complexity of these issues, it is EASY to read.Frankly, I read Richard Dawkins’ “Magic of Reality” with pleasure; is it because I’m the daughter of a physicist? I do not know… but I recommend it strongly."
85,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Another excellent book by Dawkins narrated by him & Lalla Ward, one of my favorite narrating teams. Dawkins covers a lot of basic science with its history. He tells a few of the legends about what various peoples around the globe have thought about natural phenomena & how science has found out what really takes place. It really is magical, in a poetic sense & he shows that very well. The universe is a fascinating place with a lot of questions remaining to be answered.He doesn't beat on religion too much in this book beyond pointing out how its explanations have been superseded by scientific discoveries. If you know someone who isn't well educated in science & wants to know a bit more, this is a great book to give them. That includes kids from about 12 & up. Dawkins is very clear & concise in his explanations. Highly recommended.Table of Contents:1. What is reality? What is magic?2. Who was the first person?3. Why are there so many different kinds of animals?4. What are things made of?5. Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?6. What is the sun?7. What is a rainbow?8. When and how did everything begin?9. Are we alone?10. What is an earthquake?11. Why do bad things happen?12. What is a miracle?"
86,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7006637-santhosh,4,"The book covers a lot of basic science topics in brief, serving as a good, clear, basic introduction to evolution, natural selection, genetics, molecular physics, cosmology, astronomy, plate tectonics and probability. While the stated audience for this book is 12-year olds, I would say it also makes a good read for intelligent adults whose science grounding is poor. The biggest current danger isn't kids not getting some education, but rather growing up into adults who falsely believe in religious dogma and wrongly assign the role of science only to laboratories and inventions - only to scientists. Adults would also do well to brush up their knowledge of the basics of our world and how these basics interact and add-up into the larger picture. To that order, this is an excellent book, one that I can ask anyone to be comfortable with first if they want to make conversation to me at the bar.As to be expected, Dawkins is in his element when speaking about his pet subject: evolutionary biology, where he draws a vivid and clear walk-through on evolution. The pieces on atoms and the forces that govern their world, speculations on extra-terrestrial life, cosmology, plate tectonics, and probability as related to 'life just is' are all excellent at what the essays set out to do: explain what they are. Overall, Dawkins is able to provide a simple and broken-down explanation of each of the topics, covering them from the individual components to the overall picture. I just wish Carl Sagan had been somehow involved in this, as he would have added his badly missed passion and child-like sense of wonder when explaining science - something which would have helped immensely to make this book, otherwise a little dry, more enjoyable.To me, Dawkins came across as fighting demons in his head while writing this book, by directing his answers toward an imagined audience holding on to their unscientific beliefs. The book thus comes across as a little contemptuous and confronting in its tone, which instead of being mildly mocking as intended, comes across as petulant and irksome while reading. For example, I'm sure that Dawkins understands what mythology is and its role in social evolution. To disdainfully table all of mythology as ignorant ramblings meant only to provide explanations of a particular natural phenomena is to underestimate and subvert the intelligence of our ancestors.In summary, an excellent idea behind the book, and in large parts follows through in the delivery as well."
87,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6068530-jim-whitefield,5,"Armed with the foreknowledge that this book is written to appeal to quite young readers as well as other ages, you will not feel Dawkins is as condescending in tone as you might otherwise be drawn to conclude. In my opinion, he does a marvellous job of writing in a fashion that will entertain and retain the interest of youngsters, whilst at the same time enthralling those of us who are of a much older generation. Beautifully illustrated throughout and with numerous wonderful photos as well, the book covers a dozen chapters on the reality of various interesting scientific aspects within which Dawkins also cunningly intertwines myths and legends surrounding them, including quite naturally, many biblical myths and legends which he phrases in ways that make them laughable rather than remotely plausible. Atheism permeates the book in a manner which is very hard to refute. He makes his readers 'think'. He is extremely adept at putting things into (simple) scientific perspective. He includes myths in pretty much every chapter, apart from the one on things so small you can't see them - and as he explains, there are no myths about them because, in terms of the evolution of human knowledge, until relatively recently, no one knew about them, so there are no myths or legends about them... simple when you think! He includes some internet links to YouTube material which are interesting, except unfortunately, the first one comes up with a notice that it is no longer available because of ""multiple third-party notifications of copyright infringement"" which is a shame as I am sure the publishers felt they had covered that. Perhaps it will get sorted out. Overall, whilst I already knew quite a lot of the things he talks about, even so, there was much I learned and I found the whole experience like being a young teenager again, learning from the best books, in the most interesting and informative - not to mention easy to understand - way imaginable. Well done Richard - I hope there will be more of these. Kids deserve such knowledge and perspective while they are as young as possible. This book should form part of the education curriculum worldwide. For me, this is yet another 'must read'. Brilliant."
88,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"I'm not entirely sure why I still read Dawkins' work. I think he's an extremely intelligent person, of course, and I've enjoyed reading books that focus on science by him -- I love The Ancestor's Tale, for example. But I hate the way that he cannot stop poking at religion, and I expected to hate it even more in a book called The Magic of Reality.Actually, he's more respectful than usual. It all seems rather toned down, since it's aimed at a younger audience than his other books (which is somewhat insulting in itself; I read and understood The Ancestor's Tale perfectly at the age of thirteen, and this book is aimed at 'ages twelve and up', I'm told). It can come across as condescending, though I rather appreciated the parts where he admits he doesn't know everything. It is accessible, for people of any age and any level of knowledge about science, covering basic topics like why we have seasons and what earthquakes are. It's quite enjoyable to read even though I don't think I learnt anything new, because it clarified things and connected ideas.He is, of course, scathing about religion and dismissive of any belief in the supernatural, but if you're planning to read Dawkins, you probably know that already."

With its lovely illustrations and clear explanations, it's an amazing gift for children.I didn't include adults because I assume they already know these basic facts of science. In reality though, I've encountered people, even some college graduates who don't know these basic stuff. And, frankly, I find it astonishing that many adults either don't know anything about or care about science. I'm not talking about rocket science. I'm talking about the fundamental questions of where we come from, our evolution, the planet we live on, what are stuff made of ... Generally things any conscious being should be interested in. We are incredibly lucky to know much more, and to have some exciting answers to these old questions. In my opinion, it's one of the great privileges we have compared to our early ancestors and indeed the rest of life on this earth that come and go without ever knowing the reason for their existence. Anyway, that's it for my rant. The point is, go get this book for any young person in your life because there's nothing grander than the Magic of Reality! ;)"

He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
91,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"In this book, the author, Richard Dawkins, explains various natural phenomena. He starts the book by identifying three different kinds of magic supernatural magic (things that happen in fairy tales, myths, religious texts etc.) stage magic (things that we know are false but are fun to watch - stage magicians for example) poetic magic (the kind of magic we use to describe our feelings about a great movie or watching a sunset or scenery etc.). Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
92,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
93,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."
94,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974523-prem-aparanji,2,"Not for young children. Teenagers maybe. But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."

The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."
96,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14258644-mohammad-tanviruzzaman,4,"Science's explanation can be more beautiful and amazing than any myth, miracle, or magic: Dawkins makes this point by picking up a series of questions (like: what is real? what is a rainbow? why do we have night and day, summer and winter? who is the first person? why are there so many kinds of life-forms? etc.), which haunt many of us time and again, and then he presents what the myths have to offer as the answer to each of those questions and what science has to offer; and through this journey one is introduced to a lot of important stuffs about science and moreover the way scientists go about applying scientific method to come up with answers. I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."
97,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34211369-mukesh-emes,5,"In this book Richard Dawkins did a great job in breaking all the religious belief about the evolution of world. The way he unwrapped some myths and miracles with the help of the science is really beautiful.

Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also. This book is a comprehensive approach to understand reality through the lens of science juxtaposing ancient and present-day myths about them.Read it please, and read it to your children as well."

In fact, the audience for this book seems to be people with shockingly little education as almost all the information contained in it is stuff a person should learn by the end of high school, stuff like ""what is an earthquake?"", ""what is a rainbow?"", the basics of evolution and gravity and other stuff like that.

(Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes. Despite this, The Magic of Reality is highly recommended for not only teenagers but readers interested in science. The app could be described as “Myth Busters meets Science for Dummies”.

111,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
112,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
113,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."

All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"
115,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6404815-henri-h-m-l-inen,4,"Richard Dawkins is world famous evolutionary biologist and author. His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school. It's an excellent book, if you can tolerate the pushing of atheism.This review was originally published in my blog - here"
116,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"This is a beautiful book with some really great illustrations, and it does a wonderful job of making science accessible to younger readers (although, not super young - the writing style is a bit challenging at times). This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."
117,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5841574-linda-rawlinson,5,"This book is an excellent explanation of science, what it's for, and why it's important. I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."
118,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29394370-srikanth-krishnamurthy,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"
119,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4987990-lana-fadel,4,"The Magic of Reality is a great book that i enjoyed reading a lot! This book provides some simple point of view answers to young adults like us who have questions about God, life, evolution and etc.. It's written by Richard Dawkins who is an atheist and has a certain point of view, not biased per say, but might be offensive to some believers. The book has scientific explanations to every question. for an instance, Dawkins defines reality as what can be perceived with the senses, detected with scientific instruments, or predicted with models. ""jealousy and joy, happiness and love,"" as they ""depend for their existence on brains"". Dawkins main point in the book is to convey that everything explained in religion can be explained in terms of science. I strongly recommend this book for people who have questions and are seeking simple answers about the conflict that science and religion are facing.  "
120,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: The book primarily targets children and young adults, but it is good for adults who know little about biology as well.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Clinton Richard Dawkins is an English evolutionary biologist and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
121,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"In this book, the author, Richard Dawkins, explains various natural phenomena. He starts the book by identifying three different kinds of magic supernatural magic (things that happen in fairy tales, myths, religious texts etc.) stage magic (things that we know are false but are fun to watch - stage magicians for example) poetic magic (the kind of magic we use to describe our feelings about a great movie or watching a sunset or scenery etc.). Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
122,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
123,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."
124,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974523-prem-aparanji,2,"Not for young children. Teenagers maybe. But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."
125,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3363047-karel-baloun,4,"This is a fine capstone book for Richard Dawkins illustrious career; I can't think of how it could be better.He bounces back-and-forth between myth and reality, and leaves us hopeful that tomorrow's reality will look like magic to us.Yet, as a science interested adult, it seemed to me that I knew every fact and every story in the book, perhaps because cosmos told so many, or because it's hard to be original in these foundational science areas with the Internet. The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."

I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."

The way he unwrapped some myths and miracles with the help of the science is really beautiful. For examples, who was the first person in this world, What are things made of, rainbow, sun etc. It is one of the simplest book I have read that deals with physics,cosmology and evolutionary biology. I would give five star to this book."

McKean's illustrations are sometimes weirder than they strictly need to be, maybe."

Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also. This book is a comprehensive approach to understand reality through the lens of science juxtaposing ancient and present-day myths about them.Read it please, and read it to your children as well."

In fact, the audience for this book seems to be people with shockingly little education as almost all the information contained in it is stuff a person should learn by the end of high school, stuff like ""what is an earthquake?"", ""what is a rainbow?"", the basics of evolution and gravity and other stuff like that.

139,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32340477-patricia-lee,5,"As a work of non-fiction,The Magic of Reality: How we know what’s really true, by Richard Dawkins and illustrated by Dave McKean, is an app, where “reading relies on touch and manipulation”. (Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes. Despite this, The Magic of Reality is highly recommended for not only teenagers but readers interested in science. The app could be described as “Myth Busters meets Science for Dummies”.

141,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
142,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
143,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."

All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"

His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school. It's an excellent book, if you can tolerate the pushing of atheism.This review was originally published in my blog - here"

This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."

I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."

The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"

This book provides some simple point of view answers to young adults like us who have questions about God, life, evolution and etc.. It's written by Richard Dawkins who is an atheist and has a certain point of view, not biased per say, but might be offensive to some believers. The book has scientific explanations to every question. for an instance, Dawkins defines reality as what can be perceived with the senses, detected with scientific instruments, or predicted with models. ""jealousy and joy, happiness and love,"" as they ""depend for their existence on brains"". Dawkins main point in the book is to convey that everything explained in religion can be explained in terms of science. I strongly recommend this book for people who have questions and are seeking simple answers about the conflict that science and religion are facing.  "
150,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: The book primarily targets children and young adults, but it is good for adults who know little about biology as well.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Clinton Richard Dawkins is an English evolutionary biologist and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
151,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"In this book, the author, Richard Dawkins, explains various natural phenomena. He starts the book by identifying three different kinds of magic supernatural magic (things that happen in fairy tales, myths, religious texts etc.) stage magic (things that we know are false but are fun to watch - stage magicians for example) poetic magic (the kind of magic we use to describe our feelings about a great movie or watching a sunset or scenery etc.). Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
152,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
153,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."
154,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974523-prem-aparanji,2,"Not for young children. Teenagers maybe. But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."

The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."

I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."

Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also. This book is a comprehensive approach to understand reality through the lens of science juxtaposing ancient and present-day myths about them.Read it please, and read it to your children as well."

(Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes. Despite this, The Magic of Reality is highly recommended for not only teenagers but readers interested in science. The app could be described as “Myth Busters meets Science for Dummies”.

171,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
172,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
173,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."
174,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49013470-brit-cheung,3,"I found a few copies of Richard Dawkins recommended by a friend by whom I sensed I need to read some scientific books to complement my poor basic science knowledge. All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"

His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school. It's an excellent book, if you can tolerate the pushing of atheism.This review was originally published in my blog - here"

This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."
177,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5841574-linda-rawlinson,5,"This book is an excellent explanation of science, what it's for, and why it's important. I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."
178,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29394370-srikanth-krishnamurthy,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"

This book provides some simple point of view answers to young adults like us who have questions about God, life, evolution and etc.. It's written by Richard Dawkins who is an atheist and has a certain point of view, not biased per say, but might be offensive to some believers. The book has scientific explanations to every question. for an instance, Dawkins defines reality as what can be perceived with the senses, detected with scientific instruments, or predicted with models. ""jealousy and joy, happiness and love,"" as they ""depend for their existence on brains"". Dawkins main point in the book is to convey that everything explained in religion can be explained in terms of science. I strongly recommend this book for people who have questions and are seeking simple answers about the conflict that science and religion are facing.  "
180,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: The book primarily targets children and young adults, but it is good for adults who know little about biology as well.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Clinton Richard Dawkins is an English evolutionary biologist and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
181,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"In this book, the author, Richard Dawkins, explains various natural phenomena. He starts the book by identifying three different kinds of magic supernatural magic (things that happen in fairy tales, myths, religious texts etc.) stage magic (things that we know are false but are fun to watch - stage magicians for example) poetic magic (the kind of magic we use to describe our feelings about a great movie or watching a sunset or scenery etc.). Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
182,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
183,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."
184,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974523-prem-aparanji,2,"Not for young children. Teenagers maybe. But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."

The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."

I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."

Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also. This book is a comprehensive approach to understand reality through the lens of science juxtaposing ancient and present-day myths about them.Read it please, and read it to your children as well."

(Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes. Despite this, The Magic of Reality is highly recommended for not only teenagers but readers interested in science. The app could be described as “Myth Busters meets Science for Dummies”.

201,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
202,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
203,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."
204,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49013470-brit-cheung,3,"I found a few copies of Richard Dawkins recommended by a friend by whom I sensed I need to read some scientific books to complement my poor basic science knowledge. All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"

His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school. It's an excellent book, if you can tolerate the pushing of atheism.This review was originally published in my blog - here"
206,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"This is a beautiful book with some really great illustrations, and it does a wonderful job of making science accessible to younger readers (although, not super young - the writing style is a bit challenging at times). This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."
207,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5841574-linda-rawlinson,5,"This book is an excellent explanation of science, what it's for, and why it's important. I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."
208,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29394370-srikanth-krishnamurthy,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"
209,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4987990-lana-fadel,4,"The Magic of Reality is a great book that i enjoyed reading a lot! This book provides some simple point of view answers to young adults like us who have questions about God, life, evolution and etc.. It's written by Richard Dawkins who is an atheist and has a certain point of view, not biased per say, but might be offensive to some believers. The book has scientific explanations to every question. for an instance, Dawkins defines reality as what can be perceived with the senses, detected with scientific instruments, or predicted with models. ""jealousy and joy, happiness and love,"" as they ""depend for their existence on brains"". Dawkins main point in the book is to convey that everything explained in religion can be explained in terms of science. I strongly recommend this book for people who have questions and are seeking simple answers about the conflict that science and religion are facing.  "
210,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: The book primarily targets children and young adults, but it is good for adults who know little about biology as well.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Clinton Richard Dawkins is an English evolutionary biologist and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
211,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"In this book, the author, Richard Dawkins, explains various natural phenomena. He starts the book by identifying three different kinds of magic supernatural magic (things that happen in fairy tales, myths, religious texts etc.) stage magic (things that we know are false but are fun to watch - stage magicians for example) poetic magic (the kind of magic we use to describe our feelings about a great movie or watching a sunset or scenery etc.). Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
212,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
213,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."
214,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974523-prem-aparanji,2,"Not for young children. Teenagers maybe. But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."
215,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3363047-karel-baloun,4,"This is a fine capstone book for Richard Dawkins illustrious career; I can't think of how it could be better.He bounces back-and-forth between myth and reality, and leaves us hopeful that tomorrow's reality will look like magic to us.Yet, as a science interested adult, it seemed to me that I knew every fact and every story in the book, perhaps because cosmos told so many, or because it's hard to be original in these foundational science areas with the Internet. The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."
216,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14258644-mohammad-tanviruzzaman,4,"Science's explanation can be more beautiful and amazing than any myth, miracle, or magic: Dawkins makes this point by picking up a series of questions (like: what is real? what is a rainbow? why do we have night and day, summer and winter? who is the first person? why are there so many kinds of life-forms? etc.), which haunt many of us time and again, and then he presents what the myths have to offer as the answer to each of those questions and what science has to offer; and through this journey one is introduced to a lot of important stuffs about science and moreover the way scientists go about applying scientific method to come up with answers. I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."
217,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34211369-mukesh-emes,5,"In this book Richard Dawkins did a great job in breaking all the religious belief about the evolution of world. The way he unwrapped some myths and miracles with the help of the science is really beautiful. For examples, who was the first person in this world, What are things made of, rainbow, sun etc. It is one of the simplest book I have read that deals with physics,cosmology and evolutionary biology. I would give five star to this book."

There isn't much here that should be new to the average intellectually curious adult, but I can certainly see myself enjoying this book at age 10 (I'm not entirely sure I was able to read English at that age, but presumably a translation is forthcoming). McKean's illustrations are sometimes weirder than they strictly need to be, maybe."

The app of the book, which contains the full text and interactive elements, is a fabulous means to engage older elementary and middle school children in scientific thinking. With emphasis on logic and seeking evidence to understand our reality, Dawkins offers a pragmatic look at a variety of topics, which include evolution, the seasons, light, etc."
220,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/373093-henry-manampiring,5,"A very recommended introduction to the most important science subjects. Dawkins wrote in layman's language, allowing common people like you and I to understand important concepts like Evolution and The Big Bang. It also comes in illustrated children for your kids. Read it yourself, and let your children read it too. And get smarter and wiser."
221,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6278604-ainar-miyata,5,Wow. I would give this a 6 if it was possible. Maybe even a 7. Dawkins's passion for science is brought to life through his succint prose and magnified thousandfold by some of the most breathtaking illustrations I've ever seen. I will buy this book for those I love.

224,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16368858-faraz-ahmed,5,"Science and scientific literacy in this day and age is extremely important, to me it is stupefying the amount of value most population gives to absurd notions stemming mostly from hearsay and false beliefs. Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also. This book is a comprehensive approach to understand reality through the lens of science juxtaposing ancient and present-day myths about them.Read it please, and read it to your children as well."

In fact, the audience for this book seems to be people with shockingly little education as almost all the information contained in it is stuff a person should learn by the end of high school, stuff like ""what is an earthquake?"", ""what is a rainbow?"", the basics of evolution and gravity and other stuff like that. The fact that this book has to exist at all for adults is quite sad."

229,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32340477-patricia-lee,5,"As a work of non-fiction,The Magic of Reality: How we know what’s really true, by Richard Dawkins and illustrated by Dave McKean, is an app, where “reading relies on touch and manipulation”. (Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes. Despite this, The Magic of Reality is highly recommended for not only teenagers but readers interested in science. The app could be described as “Myth Busters meets Science for Dummies”.

231,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
232,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
233,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."
234,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49013470-brit-cheung,3,"I found a few copies of Richard Dawkins recommended by a friend by whom I sensed I need to read some scientific books to complement my poor basic science knowledge. All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"

His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school. It's an excellent book, if you can tolerate the pushing of atheism.This review was originally published in my blog - here"

This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."

I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."

The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"

This book provides some simple point of view answers to young adults like us who have questions about God, life, evolution and etc.. It's written by Richard Dawkins who is an atheist and has a certain point of view, not biased per say, but might be offensive to some believers. The book has scientific explanations to every question. for an instance, Dawkins defines reality as what can be perceived with the senses, detected with scientific instruments, or predicted with models. ""jealousy and joy, happiness and love,"" as they ""depend for their existence on brains"". Dawkins main point in the book is to convey that everything explained in religion can be explained in terms of science. I strongly recommend this book for people who have questions and are seeking simple answers about the conflict that science and religion are facing.  "
240,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: The book primarily targets children and young adults, but it is good for adults who know little about biology as well.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Clinton Richard Dawkins is an English evolutionary biologist and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
241,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"In this book, the author, Richard Dawkins, explains various natural phenomena. He starts the book by identifying three different kinds of magic supernatural magic (things that happen in fairy tales, myths, religious texts etc.) stage magic (things that we know are false but are fun to watch - stage magicians for example) poetic magic (the kind of magic we use to describe our feelings about a great movie or watching a sunset or scenery etc.). Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
242,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
243,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."
244,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974523-prem-aparanji,2,"Not for young children. Teenagers maybe. But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."
245,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3363047-karel-baloun,4,"This is a fine capstone book for Richard Dawkins illustrious career; I can't think of how it could be better.He bounces back-and-forth between myth and reality, and leaves us hopeful that tomorrow's reality will look like magic to us.Yet, as a science interested adult, it seemed to me that I knew every fact and every story in the book, perhaps because cosmos told so many, or because it's hard to be original in these foundational science areas with the Internet. The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."

I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."
247,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34211369-mukesh-emes,5,"In this book Richard Dawkins did a great job in breaking all the religious belief about the evolution of world. The way he unwrapped some myths and miracles with the help of the science is really beautiful. For examples, who was the first person in this world, What are things made of, rainbow, sun etc. It is one of the simplest book I have read that deals with physics,cosmology and evolutionary biology. I would give five star to this book."

There isn't much here that should be new to the average intellectually curious adult, but I can certainly see myself enjoying this book at age 10 (I'm not entirely sure I was able to read English at that age, but presumably a translation is forthcoming). McKean's illustrations are sometimes weirder than they strictly need to be, maybe."

The app of the book, which contains the full text and interactive elements, is a fabulous means to engage older elementary and middle school children in scientific thinking.

Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also. This book is a comprehensive approach to understand reality through the lens of science juxtaposing ancient and present-day myths about them.Read it please, and read it to your children as well."

In fact, the audience for this book seems to be people with shockingly little education as almost all the information contained in it is stuff a person should learn by the end of high school, stuff like ""what is an earthquake?"", ""what is a rainbow?"", the basics of evolution and gravity and other stuff like that.

259,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32340477-patricia-lee,5,"As a work of non-fiction,The Magic of Reality: How we know what’s really true, by Richard Dawkins and illustrated by Dave McKean, is an app, where “reading relies on touch and manipulation”. (Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes. Despite this, The Magic of Reality is highly recommended for not only teenagers but readers interested in science. The app could be described as “Myth Busters meets Science for Dummies”.

261,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
262,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
263,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."
264,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49013470-brit-cheung,3,"I found a few copies of Richard Dawkins recommended by a friend by whom I sensed I need to read some scientific books to complement my poor basic science knowledge. All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"
265,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6404815-henri-h-m-l-inen,4,"Richard Dawkins is world famous evolutionary biologist and author. His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school. It's an excellent book, if you can tolerate the pushing of atheism.This review was originally published in my blog - here"

This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."

I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."

The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"

This book provides some simple point of view answers to young adults like us who have questions about God, life, evolution and etc.. It's written by Richard Dawkins who is an atheist and has a certain point of view, not biased per say, but might be offensive to some believers. The book has scientific explanations to every question. for an instance, Dawkins defines reality as what can be perceived with the senses, detected with scientific instruments, or predicted with models. ""jealousy and joy, happiness and love,"" as they ""depend for their existence on brains"". Dawkins main point in the book is to convey that everything explained in religion can be explained in terms of science. I strongly recommend this book for people who have questions and are seeking simple answers about the conflict that science and religion are facing.  "

Well, science is not really about proving anything in our normal understanding of the term. It is about creating ideas which are not disproven, and the whole point of science is to find disproofs of all the existing understanding of science. Further, he really believes that science has to do with disproving ""myths"" such as creation myths. He fails to believe that these myths might be metaphorical, ""best explanations"" that people can come up with, and he uses really bizarre metaphorical language to explain science himself, which is very much worse in my mind than that was in my mind. But, he *does* write well. He is good at telling a story which is easy to get engaged in. So, this aspect managed to get me through this book..."

I will be requesting a copy for my 9th grade classroom. Kids are naturally curious and fascinated by how the world works. They're also susceptible to all kinds of nonsense, of course. This much-needed book fill s a gap between simplistic kids' books and adult science books. I like how he started each chapter focusing on a myth that in the past served as an explanation for a natural phenomenon. The not so good: His tone fluctuated so often that in some parts of the book he could have been explaining something to a 10 year old, in other parts he could easily have been speaking to a senior in high school. No consistency. This book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters."

For me, this leaves out the spiritual side of life, and those things we cannot yet, or perhaps ever will explain, and it takes the fun out of the read, and of life.No one, not even he, will find all the answers, and while he does acknowledge what he doesn't know at times, he also doesn't leave his door open to explanations other than scientific, which I am sympathetic to.I think I've learned all I can from him for now.(p.s.- I think HE should read the Biology of Belief and let his own thinking continue to grow up alongside it)"

O well!Beware all ye religious: Dawkins pulls no punches in asserting that most religion is unsubstantiated myth, and his tone (in writing this book for young people) will strike you as especially condescending. I enjoyed the work for the way Dawkins makes his point across such wide-ranging areas of science. Reality really is magical! I also learned: mules are sterile, rainbows are cool, and Newton + prisms put us all to shame. (Is there still something left to discover with a prism?) I also have a new appreciation for the microscope and the way it reveals major plot holes in all major religions for failing to address phenomenon hidden from the naked eye.Curious about the illustrated version!"

288,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14515345-erin-britton,5,"Richard Dawkins’ The Magic of Reality begins with a question: if reality is everything that exists, then how do we know what exists? In many cases this question of existence can be answered easy by recourse to our five senses. Our ability to see, smell, touch, taste and hear provides us with effective means of establishing this reality. However, the question really is: if our senses cannot detect something directly, then how do we know if it’s real? Lots of things can be seen to fall within this puzzle, for example galaxies that are too far away to see, radio waves that cannot be detected by either our eyes or our ears, and even dinosaurs since they are no longer around to be detected by anything. The answer seems to be that we know all of these things exist due to various methods of often complex investigation, investigation that can ultimately be labelled as science.Of course, scientific investigation isn’t the only means of explaining the existence of things and so, before science stepped in with an answer, magic was often credited as being involved. The ancient Egyptians for example explained the existence of night by suggesting that the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. Likewise, the Japanese used to explain earthquakes as being caused when the giant catfish that carried the world on its back flipped its tail. These are clearly extraordinary, magical explanations. However, it could be said that a different kind of magic exists in the discovery of the real answers to question of why things happen. With The Magic of Reality Dawkins therefore seeks to demonstrate that the real would, as it can be understood scientifically, has a magic all of its own.In The Magic of Reality each chapter is dedicated to one particular aspect of reality – whether it be the sun or earthquakes or rainbows or the many species of animals that exists – and investigates how and why that particular thing has come to be. In the chapter concerning “Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?” for example, Dawkins examines the two great rhythms that dominate our lives. He begins with a couple of Aboriginal myths about the day-night cycle as well as the myth of Persephone, before detailing how the seasonal rhythm is explained by the yearly orbiting of the Earth around the sun at a distance of 93 million miles while the daily rhythm is explained by the Earth’s spinning round and round like a top.The Magic of Reality is an immensely interesting book. Richard Dawkins has taken a host of complex and vital topics and has explained them in a clear, concise manner that would suit both the layman and those with some scientific knowledge. Dawkins provides inspiring explanations of space, time, evolution and other matters within the realm of thought experiments and so uses The Magic of Reality to explain an amazingly wide range of natural phenomena. The breadth of topics covered is immense yet Dawkins’ clear explanative style ensures that all information is presented in an accurate and detailed yet straightforward manner that makes it a pleasure rather than a chore to read.One potential disappointment with this particular edition of The Magic of Reality is that it is a special text-only edition. The original hardback edition contained delightful and illuminating colour illustrations from Dave McKean [yes, of Hellblazer and Sandman fame]. The quality of the illustrations resulted in the hardback of The Magic of Reality being a truly beautiful as well as informative volume. It is intended to be a book that explains science in a clear and exuberant fashion that appeals to readers of all ages and the inclusion of the illustrations would have served to broaden its appeal, particularly to young readers. There is another, more expensive, paperback edition due out later this year and it seems likely that that one will be illustrated, so it’s worth considering which edition would be most suited to your particular interests.Despite having lamented the absence of illustrations, the strength of the text of The Magic of Reality must be reiterated. It is a real page-turner of a science book that grips the reader’s imagination from the very beginning and never fails to both enlighten and astonish. The Magic of Reality is an accessible guide to nearly all of the important questions about the nature of life and the universe."
289,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49908117-vijay-akhade,5,"I hope you agree that the truth has a magic of its own. The truth is more magical-in the best and most exciting sense of the word-than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.We may care about fairness and unfairness, but coins don't give a toss! Nor does the universe at large. Bad things happen because things happen. Whether they are bad or good from our point of view doesn't influence how likely it is that they will happen. Some people find it hard to accept this. They'd prefer to think that sinners get their comeuppance, that virtue is rewarded. Unfortunately the universe doesn't care what people prefer.Scientists don't stop at proposing a model: they then go on to test it. They say, 'If this model that I am imagining were true, we would expect to see such-and-such in the real world'. They predict what you""ll find if you do a particular experiment and make certain measurements. A successful model is one whose predictions come out right, especially if they survive the test of experiment. And if the predictions come out right, we hope it means that the model probably represents the truth, or at least a part of the truth.If these'holy books' really were written, or dictated, or inspired, by all-knowing gods, don't you think its odd that these gods said nothing about any of these important and useful things?Is there really life on other planets ? Nobody knows. If you forced me to give an opinion one way or the other, I'd say yes, and probably on millions of planets. But who cares about an opinion ? There is no direct evidence. One of the great virtues of science is that scientists know when they don't know the answer to something. They cheerfully admit that they don't know. Cheerfully, because not knowing the answer is an exciting challenge to try to find it. There is much that remains deeply mysterious, and it is not likely that we will ever uncover all the secrets of a universe as vast as ours: but, armed with science, we can at least ask sensible, meaningful questions about it and recognize credible answers when we find them. We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories : we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy.Don't ever be lazy enough-defeatist enough, cowardly enough-to say 'It must be supernatural'or 'It must be a miracle'. Say instead that it's a puzzle, it's strange, it's a challenge that we should rise to. Whether we rise to the challenge by questioning the truth of the observation, or by expanding our science in new and exciting directions, the proper and brave response to any such challenge is to tackle it head-on. And until we have found a proper answer to the mystery, it's perfectly OK simply to say, ""This is something we don't yet understand, but we're working on it'. Indeed it is the only honest thing to do."
290,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23209335-sheryl,2,"I guess the fact that I was not this book's intended audience might have something to do with how little I liked it. Apparently it's meant for children/young adults? And apparently it's supposed to be illustrated?? Heads up - the paperback is not at all illustrated besides the small images at the start of each chapter. I really have no idea why you would even publish this book without the illustrations if it's meant to be a children/young adults' science book.I started out thinking that excerpts from this book would have been great required reading for a middle school/early high school science class (with the addition of illustrations, of course, to help drive the understanding home), but I quickly realized that that Dawkins's tone is just too condescending and rude for me to want to force that on anyone. Listen, I'm kind of on his side here, where I think understanding science is more ""magical"" than any religious explanation for things, but man, why you gotta be a jerk about it? I found a lot of his explanations lacking - though mainly that was due to the lack of illustrations in my copy. I was entirely dissatisfied with his explanation of sleep paralysis - don't be all, ""Alien abductions and other horror stories are from sleep paralysis, where people throughout the ages have all hallucinated the same thing"" without addressing the fact that it's HELLA WEIRD WE ALL HALLUCINATE THE SAME THING. Sleep paralysis is one of the few things that gets me borderline believing in something ""supernatural"" because it's so freaking weird, and after forcing my way through this book and finally getting excited about actually learning something, I was let down pretty bad by his explanation or lack thereof.I also felt the structure of the book didn't hold up: the basic structure is ""Here's a religious belief/myth, here's the truth behind it"", but several times the chapter starts with ""Well, I couldn't find any myths about this, but let me explain it anyway."" Like...why? That's not the point of the book? Do you just want to explain something to hear yourself talk (er...write?)?I feel bad kind of bad because I ultimately agree with the premise of this book, but it was poorly executed, in my opinion. Maybe as a young preteen just discovering atheism, this would be more exciting. But for me, I thoroughly hated reading it."
291,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."

Ego still flares and I bristle. It’s annoying being talked to in this way. Does anyone enjoy the tone of this book? Could we not just agree that the human brain is at face value a beautiful thing? Dismissing the intelligence of your reader is tantamount to reducing their intelligence by refusing to give them opportunity to be intelligent. This book is full of weird sentences, statements that are tantamount to insulting your intelligence, etc. “They depend for their existence on” * “It May not be that all of these people are charlatans, it may be that some of them really believe they are talking to the dead” “Gene pools are not liquid. So what are they?” Really??? “Tectonic plates are not like the kind you eat off”. This book must be geared towards a 10 year old? There’s nothing in this you wouldn’t know if you had graduated high school. Nothing goes beyond basic science. Everything is glib. Everything leaves important details out. It’s difficult to respect this in any sense at all for an adult audience. However, I could see it being an excellent resource for children, it’s fast, poppy, fun, and over simplified to the point where you might have to add some additional information, but only for an interested reader or listener.

293,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76947495-debayan-koley,3,"This book intends to provide a fundamental scientific viewpoint towards the existence of life and it's journey in our universe. The author found a fascinating way to guide us through the origin of the universe, it's expansion and how all the natural phenomenons are occurring around us. In short, he tried to enrich and enhance our perception of reality by making us understand the underlying mechanism, and considering the general base of readers, he should be successful. To gain a simplistic yet firm understanding of our perceived reality, how it has affected our culturally diverse mindset throughout time, this book is a gem. But what amazes me most is that this book instills a sense of gratitude. It reminds us how insignificant we are in this universe yet how lucky we are to be a part of this majestic existence."
294,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1146890-v,2,"I don't know who the intended audience for this book might be. It certainly is not really for those with a background in science or engineering. Ironically, those are the type of folks who would be most interested in reading a book by Dawkins... and they are quite likely to already be well-versed in the basic biology/geology/astronomy that Dawkins presents. The myths are kind of fun, but I'm not convinced they added much. One thing I do enjoy about reading Dawkins is that he does come up with different sorts of metaphors/analogies to explain concepts than are generally presented in classroom/textbook settings and often re-words and re-reasons things in a way that can help me understand them more fully. Alas, this book did not contain much material of that nature."

This does not mean that an adult will find the book boring. On the contrary, the clear and concise writing makes it a refreshing read.The book essentially is a set of twelve questions and their scientific answers. Dawkins begins the answer to every question by describing the ancient myths (which are very funny BTW) that were made up in an attempt to answer the questions. He then goes on and explains the actual answer as given by science. Essentially, he goes on to show that the scientific truths, once understood, are more magical than any supernatural answer."

The purpose of myths is talking in a metaphorical and poetic way. Trying 'understand' reality by being very literally saying that myths are wrong or reality or saying that you have the ultimate truth thanks to science is being completely unscientific and arrogant. Real scientific people are as curious, religious and love metaphors because life and the world Can't really be explained.Coming from the engineering world I still learned a few things about optics and science, not more than that."

Great for highschoolers looking to familiarise themselves with basic concepts; if you're one, go for it!The comparison between modes of explaining (naive/folk vs science) lacks depth (Dawkins merely notes that it is interesting how easily the former prevail); I was also hoping to hear Dawkins's own experiences in transcendental/exhilarating thoughts arising from nonmagical thinking (Dawkins does praise the mind-expansion of discovering the electromagnetic spectrum.)"

But it tried to create ways to think about it
299,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17746529-mehedi-sarwar,5,"Nicely written book with several examples. It describes well how the myths are created through different cultures and scriptures when mankind was more busy with survival than scientific exploration of any kind. Many myths would not have created if proper science was already there. Most of the supernatural phenomena we hear about, we hear from our parents, they heard from their parents and so on. Science has already disproved many of them. One of the good takeaway from this book is, if something cannot be explained we do not have to assume that it happened super-naturally or by command of some God, rather we should tell to ourselves that we do know the answer yet, that is the answer is ""X"" , the big unknown. Actually, ""X"" the Unknown should be the default answer to any question until we know the answer. The audio book narration was great. "
300,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4101408-jigme-datse,2,"Richard Dawkins does not seem to understand science. He strongly believes that science will prove everything. Well, science is not really about proving anything in our normal understanding of the term. It is about creating ideas which are not disproven, and the whole point of science is to find disproofs of all the existing understanding of science. Further, he really believes that science has to do with disproving ""myths"" such as creation myths. He fails to believe that these myths might be metaphorical, ""best explanations"" that people can come up with, and he uses really bizarre metaphorical language to explain science himself, which is very much worse in my mind than that was in my mind. But, he *does* write well. He is good at telling a story which is easy to get engaged in. So, this aspect managed to get me through this book..."

I will be requesting a copy for my 9th grade classroom. Kids are naturally curious and fascinated by how the world works. They're also susceptible to all kinds of nonsense, of course. This much-needed book fill s a gap between simplistic kids' books and adult science books. I like how he started each chapter focusing on a myth that in the past served as an explanation for a natural phenomenon. The not so good: His tone fluctuated so often that in some parts of the book he could have been explaining something to a 10 year old, in other parts he could easily have been speaking to a senior in high school. No consistency. This book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters."

For me, this leaves out the spiritual side of life, and those things we cannot yet, or perhaps ever will explain, and it takes the fun out of the read, and of life.No one, not even he, will find all the answers, and while he does acknowledge what he doesn't know at times, he also doesn't leave his door open to explanations other than scientific, which I am sympathetic to.I think I've learned all I can from him for now.(p.s.- I think HE should read the Biology of Belief and let his own thinking continue to grow up alongside it)"

O well!Beware all ye religious: Dawkins pulls no punches in asserting that most religion is unsubstantiated myth, and his tone (in writing this book for young people) will strike you as especially condescending. I enjoyed the work for the way Dawkins makes his point across such wide-ranging areas of science. Reality really is magical! I also learned: mules are sterile, rainbows are cool, and Newton + prisms put us all to shame. (Is there still something left to discover with a prism?) I also have a new appreciation for the microscope and the way it reveals major plot holes in all major religions for failing to address phenomenon hidden from the naked eye.Curious about the illustrated version!"

The original hardback edition contained delightful and illuminating colour illustrations from Dave McKean [yes, of Hellblazer and Sandman fame]. The quality of the illustrations resulted in the hardback of The Magic of Reality being a truly beautiful as well as informative volume. It is intended to be a book that explains science in a clear and exuberant fashion that appeals to readers of all ages and the inclusion of the illustrations would have served to broaden its appeal, particularly to young readers. There is another, more expensive, paperback edition due out later this year and it seems likely that that one will be illustrated, so it’s worth considering which edition would be most suited to your particular interests.Despite having lamented the absence of illustrations, the strength of the text of The Magic of Reality must be reiterated. It is a real page-turner of a science book that grips the reader’s imagination from the very beginning and never fails to both enlighten and astonish. The Magic of Reality is an accessible guide to nearly all of the important questions about the nature of life and the universe."

The truth is more magical-in the best and most exciting sense of the word-than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.We may care about fairness and unfairness, but coins don't give a toss! Nor does the universe at large. Bad things happen because things happen. Whether they are bad or good from our point of view doesn't influence how likely it is that they will happen. Some people find it hard to accept this. They'd prefer to think that sinners get their comeuppance, that virtue is rewarded. Unfortunately the universe doesn't care what people prefer.Scientists don't stop at proposing a model: they then go on to test it. They say, 'If this model that I am imagining were true, we would expect to see such-and-such in the real world'. They predict what you""ll find if you do a particular experiment and make certain measurements. A successful model is one whose predictions come out right, especially if they survive the test of experiment. And if the predictions come out right, we hope it means that the model probably represents the truth, or at least a part of the truth.If these'holy books' really were written, or dictated, or inspired, by all-knowing gods, don't you think its odd that these gods said nothing about any of these important and useful things?Is there really life on other planets ? Nobody knows. If you forced me to give an opinion one way or the other, I'd say yes, and probably on millions of planets. But who cares about an opinion ? There is no direct evidence. One of the great virtues of science is that scientists know when they don't know the answer to something. They cheerfully admit that they don't know. Cheerfully, because not knowing the answer is an exciting challenge to try to find it. There is much that remains deeply mysterious, and it is not likely that we will ever uncover all the secrets of a universe as vast as ours: but, armed with science, we can at least ask sensible, meaningful questions about it and recognize credible answers when we find them. We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories : we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy.Don't ever be lazy enough-defeatist enough, cowardly enough-to say 'It must be supernatural'or 'It must be a miracle'. Say instead that it's a puzzle, it's strange, it's a challenge that we should rise to. Whether we rise to the challenge by questioning the truth of the observation, or by expanding our science in new and exciting directions, the proper and brave response to any such challenge is to tackle it head-on. And until we have found a proper answer to the mystery, it's perfectly OK simply to say, ""This is something we don't yet understand, but we're working on it'. Indeed it is the only honest thing to do."

Apparently it's meant for children/young adults? And apparently it's supposed to be illustrated?? Heads up - the paperback is not at all illustrated besides the small images at the start of each chapter. I really have no idea why you would even publish this book without the illustrations if it's meant to be a children/young adults' science book.I started out thinking that excerpts from this book would have been great required reading for a middle school/early high school science class (with the addition of illustrations, of course, to help drive the understanding home), but I quickly realized that that Dawkins's tone is just too condescending and rude for me to want to force that on anyone. Listen, I'm kind of on his side here, where I think understanding science is more ""magical"" than any religious explanation for things, but man, why you gotta be a jerk about it? I found a lot of his explanations lacking - though mainly that was due to the lack of illustrations in my copy. I was entirely dissatisfied with his explanation of sleep paralysis - don't be all, ""Alien abductions and other horror stories are from sleep paralysis, where people throughout the ages have all hallucinated the same thing"" without addressing the fact that it's HELLA WEIRD WE ALL HALLUCINATE THE SAME THING. Sleep paralysis is one of the few things that gets me borderline believing in something ""supernatural"" because it's so freaking weird, and after forcing my way through this book and finally getting excited about actually learning something, I was let down pretty bad by his explanation or lack thereof.I also felt the structure of the book didn't hold up: the basic structure is ""Here's a religious belief/myth, here's the truth behind it"", but several times the chapter starts with ""Well, I couldn't find any myths about this, but let me explain it anyway."" Like...why? That's not the point of the book? Do you just want to explain something to hear yourself talk (er...write?)?I feel bad kind of bad because I ultimately agree with the premise of this book, but it was poorly executed, in my opinion. Maybe as a young preteen just discovering atheism, this would be more exciting. But for me, I thoroughly hated reading it."
321,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."

Ego still flares and I bristle. It’s annoying being talked to in this way. Does anyone enjoy the tone of this book? Could we not just agree that the human brain is at face value a beautiful thing? Dismissing the intelligence of your reader is tantamount to reducing their intelligence by refusing to give them opportunity to be intelligent. This book is full of weird sentences, statements that are tantamount to insulting your intelligence, etc. “They depend for their existence on” * “It May not be that all of these people are charlatans, it may be that some of them really believe they are talking to the dead” “Gene pools are not liquid. So what are they?” Really??? “Tectonic plates are not like the kind you eat off”. This book must be geared towards a 10 year old? There’s nothing in this you wouldn’t know if you had graduated high school. Nothing goes beyond basic science. Everything is glib. Everything leaves important details out. It’s difficult to respect this in any sense at all for an adult audience. However, I could see it being an excellent resource for children, it’s fast, poppy, fun, and over simplified to the point where you might have to add some additional information, but only for an interested reader or listener.

The author found a fascinating way to guide us through the origin of the universe, it's expansion and how all the natural phenomenons are occurring around us. In short, he tried to enrich and enhance our perception of reality by making us understand the underlying mechanism, and considering the general base of readers, he should be successful. To gain a simplistic yet firm understanding of our perceived reality, how it has affected our culturally diverse mindset throughout time, this book is a gem. But what amazes me most is that this book instills a sense of gratitude. It reminds us how insignificant we are in this universe yet how lucky we are to be a part of this majestic existence."
324,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1146890-v,2,"I don't know who the intended audience for this book might be. It certainly is not really for those with a background in science or engineering. Ironically, those are the type of folks who would be most interested in reading a book by Dawkins... and they are quite likely to already be well-versed in the basic biology/geology/astronomy that Dawkins presents. The myths are kind of fun, but I'm not convinced they added much. One thing I do enjoy about reading Dawkins is that he does come up with different sorts of metaphors/analogies to explain concepts than are generally presented in classroom/textbook settings and often re-words and re-reasons things in a way that can help me understand them more fully. Alas, this book did not contain much material of that nature."
325,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68315333-chaithanya-k,4,"This is a book that is meant for teenagers as an introduction to the science around us. This does not mean that an adult will find the book boring. On the contrary, the clear and concise writing makes it a refreshing read.The book essentially is a set of twelve questions and their scientific answers. Dawkins begins the answer to every question by describing the ancient myths (which are very funny BTW) that were made up in an attempt to answer the questions. He then goes on and explains the actual answer as given by science. Essentially, he goes on to show that the scientific truths, once understood, are more magical than any supernatural answer."

The purpose of myths is talking in a metaphorical and poetic way. Trying 'understand' reality by being very literally saying that myths are wrong or reality or saying that you have the ultimate truth thanks to science is being completely unscientific and arrogant. Real scientific people are as curious, religious and love metaphors because life and the world Can't really be explained.Coming from the engineering world I still learned a few things about optics and science, not more than that."

Also a catalogue of non-scientific myths and their scientific counterparts. Great for highschoolers looking to familiarise themselves with basic concepts; if you're one, go for it!The comparison between modes of explaining (naive/folk vs science) lacks depth (Dawkins merely notes that it is interesting how easily the former prevail); I was also hoping to hear Dawkins's own experiences in transcendental/exhilarating thoughts arising from nonmagical thinking (Dawkins does praise the mind-expansion of discovering the electromagnetic spectrum.)"

But it tried to create ways to think about it
329,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17746529-mehedi-sarwar,5,"Nicely written book with several examples. It describes well how the myths are created through different cultures and scriptures when mankind was more busy with survival than scientific exploration of any kind. Many myths would not have created if proper science was already there. Most of the supernatural phenomena we hear about, we hear from our parents, they heard from their parents and so on. Science has already disproved many of them. One of the good takeaway from this book is, if something cannot be explained we do not have to assume that it happened super-naturally or by command of some God, rather we should tell to ourselves that we do know the answer yet, that is the answer is ""X"" , the big unknown. Actually, ""X"" the Unknown should be the default answer to any question until we know the answer. The audio book narration was great. "
330,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4101408-jigme-datse,2,"Richard Dawkins does not seem to understand science. He strongly believes that science will prove everything. Well, science is not really about proving anything in our normal understanding of the term. It is about creating ideas which are not disproven, and the whole point of science is to find disproofs of all the existing understanding of science. Further, he really believes that science has to do with disproving ""myths"" such as creation myths. He fails to believe that these myths might be metaphorical, ""best explanations"" that people can come up with, and he uses really bizarre metaphorical language to explain science himself, which is very much worse in my mind than that was in my mind. But, he *does* write well. He is good at telling a story which is easy to get engaged in. So, this aspect managed to get me through this book..."
331,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14115149-jaclynn,3,"Dawkins writes (and has illustrated) a book for teens? Count me in!The good: Clear and accessible. I will be requesting a copy for my 9th grade classroom. Kids are naturally curious and fascinated by how the world works. They're also susceptible to all kinds of nonsense, of course. This much-needed book fill s a gap between simplistic kids' books and adult science books. I like how he started each chapter focusing on a myth that in the past served as an explanation for a natural phenomenon. The not so good: His tone fluctuated so often that in some parts of the book he could have been explaining something to a 10 year old, in other parts he could easily have been speaking to a senior in high school. No consistency. This book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters."

For me, this leaves out the spiritual side of life, and those things we cannot yet, or perhaps ever will explain, and it takes the fun out of the read, and of life.No one, not even he, will find all the answers, and while he does acknowledge what he doesn't know at times, he also doesn't leave his door open to explanations other than scientific, which I am sympathetic to.I think I've learned all I can from him for now.(p.s.- I think HE should read the Biology of Belief and let his own thinking continue to grow up alongside it)"

O well!Beware all ye religious: Dawkins pulls no punches in asserting that most religion is unsubstantiated myth, and his tone (in writing this book for young people) will strike you as especially condescending. I enjoyed the work for the way Dawkins makes his point across such wide-ranging areas of science. Reality really is magical! I also learned: mules are sterile, rainbows are cool, and Newton + prisms put us all to shame. (Is there still something left to discover with a prism?) I also have a new appreciation for the microscope and the way it reveals major plot holes in all major religions for failing to address phenomenon hidden from the naked eye.Curious about the illustrated version!"

348,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14515345-erin-britton,5,"Richard Dawkins’ The Magic of Reality begins with a question: if reality is everything that exists, then how do we know what exists? In many cases this question of existence can be answered easy by recourse to our five senses. Our ability to see, smell, touch, taste and hear provides us with effective means of establishing this reality. However, the question really is: if our senses cannot detect something directly, then how do we know if it’s real? Lots of things can be seen to fall within this puzzle, for example galaxies that are too far away to see, radio waves that cannot be detected by either our eyes or our ears, and even dinosaurs since they are no longer around to be detected by anything. The answer seems to be that we know all of these things exist due to various methods of often complex investigation, investigation that can ultimately be labelled as science.Of course, scientific investigation isn’t the only means of explaining the existence of things and so, before science stepped in with an answer, magic was often credited as being involved. The ancient Egyptians for example explained the existence of night by suggesting that the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. Likewise, the Japanese used to explain earthquakes as being caused when the giant catfish that carried the world on its back flipped its tail. These are clearly extraordinary, magical explanations. However, it could be said that a different kind of magic exists in the discovery of the real answers to question of why things happen. With The Magic of Reality Dawkins therefore seeks to demonstrate that the real would, as it can be understood scientifically, has a magic all of its own.In The Magic of Reality each chapter is dedicated to one particular aspect of reality – whether it be the sun or earthquakes or rainbows or the many species of animals that exists – and investigates how and why that particular thing has come to be. In the chapter concerning “Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?” for example, Dawkins examines the two great rhythms that dominate our lives. He begins with a couple of Aboriginal myths about the day-night cycle as well as the myth of Persephone, before detailing how the seasonal rhythm is explained by the yearly orbiting of the Earth around the sun at a distance of 93 million miles while the daily rhythm is explained by the Earth’s spinning round and round like a top.The Magic of Reality is an immensely interesting book. Richard Dawkins has taken a host of complex and vital topics and has explained them in a clear, concise manner that would suit both the layman and those with some scientific knowledge. Dawkins provides inspiring explanations of space, time, evolution and other matters within the realm of thought experiments and so uses The Magic of Reality to explain an amazingly wide range of natural phenomena. The breadth of topics covered is immense yet Dawkins’ clear explanative style ensures that all information is presented in an accurate and detailed yet straightforward manner that makes it a pleasure rather than a chore to read.One potential disappointment with this particular edition of The Magic of Reality is that it is a special text-only edition.

Sleep paralysis is one of the few things that gets me borderline believing in something ""supernatural"" because it's so freaking weird, and after forcing my way through this book and finally getting excited about actually learning something, I was let down pretty bad by his explanation or lack thereof.I also felt the structure of the book didn't hold up: the basic structure is ""Here's a religious belief/myth, here's the truth behind it"", but several times the chapter starts with ""Well, I couldn't find any myths about this, but let me explain it anyway.""

I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all.

I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."

Dismissing the intelligence of your reader is tantamount to reducing their intelligence by refusing to give them opportunity to be intelligent. This book is full of weird sentences, statements that are tantamount to insulting your intelligence, etc. “They depend for their existence on” * “It May not be that all of these people are charlatans, it may be that some of them really believe they are talking to the dead” “Gene pools are not liquid. So what are they?” Really??? “Tectonic plates are not like the kind you eat off”. This book must be geared towards a 10 year old? There’s nothing in this you wouldn’t know if you had graduated high school. Nothing goes beyond basic science. Everything is glib. Everything leaves important details out. It’s difficult to respect this in any sense at all for an adult audience. However, I could see it being an excellent resource for children, it’s fast, poppy, fun, and over simplified to the point where you might have to add some additional information, but only for an interested reader or listener.

The author found a fascinating way to guide us through the origin of the universe, it's expansion and how all the natural phenomenons are occurring around us. In short, he tried to enrich and enhance our perception of reality by making us understand the underlying mechanism, and considering the general base of readers, he should be successful. To gain a simplistic yet firm understanding of our perceived reality, how it has affected our culturally diverse mindset throughout time, this book is a gem. But what amazes me most is that this book instills a sense of gratitude. It reminds us how insignificant we are in this universe yet how lucky we are to be a part of this majestic existence."

It certainly is not really for those with a background in science or engineering. Ironically, those are the type of folks who would be most interested in reading a book by Dawkins... and they are quite likely to already be well-versed in the basic biology/geology/astronomy that Dawkins presents. The myths are kind of fun, but I'm not convinced they added much. One thing I do enjoy about reading Dawkins is that he does come up with different sorts of metaphors/analogies to explain concepts than are generally presented in classroom/textbook settings and often re-words and re-reasons things in a way that can help me understand them more fully. Alas, this book did not contain much material of that nature."

This does not mean that an adult will find the book boring. On the contrary, the clear and concise writing makes it a refreshing read.The book essentially is a set of twelve questions and their scientific answers. Dawkins begins the answer to every question by describing the ancient myths (which are very funny BTW) that were made up in an attempt to answer the questions. He then goes on and explains the actual answer as given by science. Essentially, he goes on to show that the scientific truths, once understood, are more magical than any supernatural answer."

The purpose of myths is talking in a metaphorical and poetic way. Trying 'understand' reality by being very literally saying that myths are wrong or reality or saying that you have the ultimate truth thanks to science is being completely unscientific and arrogant. Real scientific people are as curious, religious and love metaphors because life and the world Can't really be explained.Coming from the engineering world I still learned a few things about optics and science, not more than that."

Great for highschoolers looking to familiarise themselves with basic concepts; if you're one, go for it!The comparison between modes of explaining (naive/folk vs science) lacks depth (Dawkins merely notes that it is interesting how easily the former prevail); I was also hoping to hear Dawkins's own experiences in transcendental/exhilarating thoughts arising from nonmagical thinking (Dawkins does praise the mind-expansion of discovering the electromagnetic spectrum.)"

It describes well how the myths are created through different cultures and scriptures when mankind was more busy with survival than scientific exploration of any kind. Many myths would not have created if proper science was already there. Most of the supernatural phenomena we hear about, we hear from our parents, they heard from their parents and so on. Science has already disproved many of them. One of the good takeaway from this book is, if something cannot be explained we do not have to assume that it happened super-naturally or by command of some God, rather we should tell to ourselves that we do know the answer yet, that is the answer is ""X"" , the big unknown. Actually, ""X"" the Unknown should be the default answer to any question until we know the answer. The audio book narration was great. "

Well, science is not really about proving anything in our normal understanding of the term. It is about creating ideas which are not disproven, and the whole point of science is to find disproofs of all the existing understanding of science. Further, he really believes that science has to do with disproving ""myths"" such as creation myths. He fails to believe that these myths might be metaphorical, ""best explanations"" that people can come up with, and he uses really bizarre metaphorical language to explain science himself, which is very much worse in my mind than that was in my mind. But, he *does* write well. He is good at telling a story which is easy to get engaged in. So, this aspect managed to get me through this book..."

I will be requesting a copy for my 9th grade classroom. Kids are naturally curious and fascinated by how the world works. They're also susceptible to all kinds of nonsense, of course. This much-needed book fill s a gap between simplistic kids' books and adult science books. I like how he started each chapter focusing on a myth that in the past served as an explanation for a natural phenomenon. The not so good: His tone fluctuated so often that in some parts of the book he could have been explaining something to a 10 year old, in other parts he could easily have been speaking to a senior in high school. No consistency. This book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters."

For me, this leaves out the spiritual side of life, and those things we cannot yet, or perhaps ever will explain, and it takes the fun out of the read, and of life.No one, not even he, will find all the answers, and while he does acknowledge what he doesn't know at times, he also doesn't leave his door open to explanations other than scientific, which I am sympathetic to.I think I've learned all I can from him for now.(p.s.- I think HE should read the Biology of Belief and let his own thinking continue to grow up alongside it)"

I enjoyed the work for the way Dawkins makes his point across such wide-ranging areas of science. Reality really is magical! I also learned: mules are sterile, rainbows are cool, and Newton + prisms put us all to shame. (Is there still something left to discover with a prism?)

378,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14515345-erin-britton,5,"Richard Dawkins’ The Magic of Reality begins with a question: if reality is everything that exists, then how do we know what exists? In many cases this question of existence can be answered easy by recourse to our five senses. Our ability to see, smell, touch, taste and hear provides us with effective means of establishing this reality. However, the question really is: if our senses cannot detect something directly, then how do we know if it’s real? Lots of things can be seen to fall within this puzzle, for example galaxies that are too far away to see, radio waves that cannot be detected by either our eyes or our ears, and even dinosaurs since they are no longer around to be detected by anything. The answer seems to be that we know all of these things exist due to various methods of often complex investigation, investigation that can ultimately be labelled as science.Of course, scientific investigation isn’t the only means of explaining the existence of things and so, before science stepped in with an answer, magic was often credited as being involved. The ancient Egyptians for example explained the existence of night by suggesting that the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. Likewise, the Japanese used to explain earthquakes as being caused when the giant catfish that carried the world on its back flipped its tail. These are clearly extraordinary, magical explanations. However, it could be said that a different kind of magic exists in the discovery of the real answers to question of why things happen. With The Magic of Reality Dawkins therefore seeks to demonstrate that the real would, as it can be understood scientifically, has a magic all of its own.In The Magic of Reality each chapter is dedicated to one particular aspect of reality – whether it be the sun or earthquakes or rainbows or the many species of animals that exists – and investigates how and why that particular thing has come to be. In the chapter concerning “Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?” for example, Dawkins examines the two great rhythms that dominate our lives. He begins with a couple of Aboriginal myths about the day-night cycle as well as the myth of Persephone, before detailing how the seasonal rhythm is explained by the yearly orbiting of the Earth around the sun at a distance of 93 million miles while the daily rhythm is explained by the Earth’s spinning round and round like a top.The Magic of Reality is an immensely interesting book. Richard Dawkins has taken a host of complex and vital topics and has explained them in a clear, concise manner that would suit both the layman and those with some scientific knowledge. Dawkins provides inspiring explanations of space, time, evolution and other matters within the realm of thought experiments and so uses The Magic of Reality to explain an amazingly wide range of natural phenomena. The breadth of topics covered is immense yet Dawkins’ clear explanative style ensures that all information is presented in an accurate and detailed yet straightforward manner that makes it a pleasure rather than a chore to read.One potential disappointment with this particular edition of The Magic of Reality is that it is a special text-only edition. The original hardback edition contained delightful and illuminating colour illustrations from Dave McKean [yes, of Hellblazer and Sandman fame]. The quality of the illustrations resulted in the hardback of The Magic of Reality being a truly beautiful as well as informative volume. It is intended to be a book that explains science in a clear and exuberant fashion that appeals to readers of all ages and the inclusion of the illustrations would have served to broaden its appeal, particularly to young readers. There is another, more expensive, paperback edition due out later this year and it seems likely that that one will be illustrated, so it’s worth considering which edition would be most suited to your particular interests.Despite having lamented the absence of illustrations, the strength of the text of The Magic of Reality must be reiterated. It is a real page-turner of a science book that grips the reader’s imagination from the very beginning and never fails to both enlighten and astonish. The Magic of Reality is an accessible guide to nearly all of the important questions about the nature of life and the universe."
379,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49908117-vijay-akhade,5,"I hope you agree that the truth has a magic of its own. The truth is more magical-in the best and most exciting sense of the word-than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.We may care about fairness and unfairness, but coins don't give a toss! Nor does the universe at large. Bad things happen because things happen. Whether they are bad or good from our point of view doesn't influence how likely it is that they will happen. Some people find it hard to accept this. They'd prefer to think that sinners get their comeuppance, that virtue is rewarded. Unfortunately the universe doesn't care what people prefer.Scientists don't stop at proposing a model: they then go on to test it. They say, 'If this model that I am imagining were true, we would expect to see such-and-such in the real world'. They predict what you""ll find if you do a particular experiment and make certain measurements. A successful model is one whose predictions come out right, especially if they survive the test of experiment. And if the predictions come out right, we hope it means that the model probably represents the truth, or at least a part of the truth.If these'holy books' really were written, or dictated, or inspired, by all-knowing gods, don't you think its odd that these gods said nothing about any of these important and useful things?Is there really life on other planets ? Nobody knows. If you forced me to give an opinion one way or the other, I'd say yes, and probably on millions of planets. But who cares about an opinion ? There is no direct evidence. One of the great virtues of science is that scientists know when they don't know the answer to something. They cheerfully admit that they don't know. Cheerfully, because not knowing the answer is an exciting challenge to try to find it. There is much that remains deeply mysterious, and it is not likely that we will ever uncover all the secrets of a universe as vast as ours: but, armed with science, we can at least ask sensible, meaningful questions about it and recognize credible answers when we find them. We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories : we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy.Don't ever be lazy enough-defeatist enough, cowardly enough-to say 'It must be supernatural'or 'It must be a miracle'. Say instead that it's a puzzle, it's strange, it's a challenge that we should rise to. Whether we rise to the challenge by questioning the truth of the observation, or by expanding our science in new and exciting directions, the proper and brave response to any such challenge is to tackle it head-on. And until we have found a proper answer to the mystery, it's perfectly OK simply to say, ""This is something we don't yet understand, but we're working on it'. Indeed it is the only honest thing to do."

Dawkins begins the answer to every question by describing the ancient myths (which are very funny BTW) that were made up in an attempt to answer the questions.

Trying 'understand' reality by being very literally saying that myths are wrong or reality or saying that you have the ultimate truth thanks to science is being completely unscientific and arrogant. Real scientific people are as curious, religious and love metaphors because life and the world Can't really be explained.Coming from the engineering world I still learned a few things about optics and science, not more than that."

It describes well how the myths are created through different cultures and scriptures when mankind was more busy with survival than scientific exploration of any kind. Many myths would not have created if proper science was already there. Most of the supernatural phenomena we hear about, we hear from our parents, they heard from their parents and so on. Science has already disproved many of them. One of the good takeaway from this book is, if something cannot be explained we do not have to assume that it happened super-naturally or by command of some God, rather we should tell to ourselves that we do know the answer yet, that is the answer is ""X"" , the big unknown. Actually, ""X"" the Unknown should be the default answer to any question until we know the answer. The audio book narration was great. "
390,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4101408-jigme-datse,2,"Richard Dawkins does not seem to understand science. He strongly believes that science will prove everything. Well, science is not really about proving anything in our normal understanding of the term. It is about creating ideas which are not disproven, and the whole point of science is to find disproofs of all the existing understanding of science. Further, he really believes that science has to do with disproving ""myths"" such as creation myths. He fails to believe that these myths might be metaphorical, ""best explanations"" that people can come up with, and he uses really bizarre metaphorical language to explain science himself, which is very much worse in my mind than that was in my mind. But, he *does* write well. He is good at telling a story which is easy to get engaged in. So, this aspect managed to get me through this book..."
391,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14115149-jaclynn,3,"Dawkins writes (and has illustrated) a book for teens? Count me in!The good: Clear and accessible. I will be requesting a copy for my 9th grade classroom. Kids are naturally curious and fascinated by how the world works. They're also susceptible to all kinds of nonsense, of course. This much-needed book fill s a gap between simplistic kids' books and adult science books. I like how he started each chapter focusing on a myth that in the past served as an explanation for a natural phenomenon. The not so good: His tone fluctuated so often that in some parts of the book he could have been explaining something to a 10 year old, in other parts he could easily have been speaking to a senior in high school. No consistency. This book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters."

For me, this leaves out the spiritual side of life, and those things we cannot yet, or perhaps ever will explain, and it takes the fun out of the read, and of life.No one, not even he, will find all the answers, and while he does acknowledge what he doesn't know at times, he also doesn't leave his door open to explanations other than scientific, which I am sympathetic to.I think I've learned all I can from him for now.(p.s.- I think HE should read the Biology of Belief and let his own thinking continue to grow up alongside it)"

O well!Beware all ye religious: Dawkins pulls no punches in asserting that most religion is unsubstantiated myth, and his tone (in writing this book for young people) will strike you as especially condescending. I enjoyed the work for the way Dawkins makes his point across such wide-ranging areas of science. Reality really is magical! I also learned: mules are sterile, rainbows are cool, and Newton + prisms put us all to shame. (Is there still something left to discover with a prism?) I also have a new appreciation for the microscope and the way it reveals major plot holes in all major religions for failing to address phenomenon hidden from the naked eye.Curious about the illustrated version!"

408,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14515345-erin-britton,5,"Richard Dawkins’ The Magic of Reality begins with a question: if reality is everything that exists, then how do we know what exists? In many cases this question of existence can be answered easy by recourse to our five senses. Our ability to see, smell, touch, taste and hear provides us with effective means of establishing this reality. However, the question really is: if our senses cannot detect something directly, then how do we know if it’s real? Lots of things can be seen to fall within this puzzle, for example galaxies that are too far away to see, radio waves that cannot be detected by either our eyes or our ears, and even dinosaurs since they are no longer around to be detected by anything. The answer seems to be that we know all of these things exist due to various methods of often complex investigation, investigation that can ultimately be labelled as science.Of course, scientific investigation isn’t the only means of explaining the existence of things and so, before science stepped in with an answer, magic was often credited as being involved. The ancient Egyptians for example explained the existence of night by suggesting that the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. Likewise, the Japanese used to explain earthquakes as being caused when the giant catfish that carried the world on its back flipped its tail. These are clearly extraordinary, magical explanations. However, it could be said that a different kind of magic exists in the discovery of the real answers to question of why things happen. With The Magic of Reality Dawkins therefore seeks to demonstrate that the real would, as it can be understood scientifically, has a magic all of its own.In The Magic of Reality each chapter is dedicated to one particular aspect of reality – whether it be the sun or earthquakes or rainbows or the many species of animals that exists – and investigates how and why that particular thing has come to be. In the chapter concerning “Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?” for example, Dawkins examines the two great rhythms that dominate our lives. He begins with a couple of Aboriginal myths about the day-night cycle as well as the myth of Persephone, before detailing how the seasonal rhythm is explained by the yearly orbiting of the Earth around the sun at a distance of 93 million miles while the daily rhythm is explained by the Earth’s spinning round and round like a top.The Magic of Reality is an immensely interesting book. Richard Dawkins has taken a host of complex and vital topics and has explained them in a clear, concise manner that would suit both the layman and those with some scientific knowledge. Dawkins provides inspiring explanations of space, time, evolution and other matters within the realm of thought experiments and so uses The Magic of Reality to explain an amazingly wide range of natural phenomena. The breadth of topics covered is immense yet Dawkins’ clear explanative style ensures that all information is presented in an accurate and detailed yet straightforward manner that makes it a pleasure rather than a chore to read.One potential disappointment with this particular edition of The Magic of Reality is that it is a special text-only edition. The original hardback edition contained delightful and illuminating colour illustrations from Dave McKean [yes, of Hellblazer and Sandman fame]. The quality of the illustrations resulted in the hardback of The Magic of Reality being a truly beautiful as well as informative volume. It is intended to be a book that explains science in a clear and exuberant fashion that appeals to readers of all ages and the inclusion of the illustrations would have served to broaden its appeal, particularly to young readers. There is another, more expensive, paperback edition due out later this year and it seems likely that that one will be illustrated, so it’s worth considering which edition would be most suited to your particular interests.Despite having lamented the absence of illustrations, the strength of the text of The Magic of Reality must be reiterated. It is a real page-turner of a science book that grips the reader’s imagination from the very beginning and never fails to both enlighten and astonish. The Magic of Reality is an accessible guide to nearly all of the important questions about the nature of life and the universe."
409,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49908117-vijay-akhade,5,"I hope you agree that the truth has a magic of its own. The truth is more magical-in the best and most exciting sense of the word-than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.We may care about fairness and unfairness, but coins don't give a toss! Nor does the universe at large. Bad things happen because things happen. Whether they are bad or good from our point of view doesn't influence how likely it is that they will happen. Some people find it hard to accept this. They'd prefer to think that sinners get their comeuppance, that virtue is rewarded. Unfortunately the universe doesn't care what people prefer.Scientists don't stop at proposing a model: they then go on to test it. They say, 'If this model that I am imagining were true, we would expect to see such-and-such in the real world'. They predict what you""ll find if you do a particular experiment and make certain measurements. A successful model is one whose predictions come out right, especially if they survive the test of experiment. And if the predictions come out right, we hope it means that the model probably represents the truth, or at least a part of the truth.If these'holy books' really were written, or dictated, or inspired, by all-knowing gods, don't you think its odd that these gods said nothing about any of these important and useful things?Is there really life on other planets ? Nobody knows. If you forced me to give an opinion one way or the other, I'd say yes, and probably on millions of planets. But who cares about an opinion ? There is no direct evidence. One of the great virtues of science is that scientists know when they don't know the answer to something. They cheerfully admit that they don't know. Cheerfully, because not knowing the answer is an exciting challenge to try to find it. There is much that remains deeply mysterious, and it is not likely that we will ever uncover all the secrets of a universe as vast as ours: but, armed with science, we can at least ask sensible, meaningful questions about it and recognize credible answers when we find them. We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories : we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy.Don't ever be lazy enough-defeatist enough, cowardly enough-to say 'It must be supernatural'or 'It must be a miracle'. Say instead that it's a puzzle, it's strange, it's a challenge that we should rise to. Whether we rise to the challenge by questioning the truth of the observation, or by expanding our science in new and exciting directions, the proper and brave response to any such challenge is to tackle it head-on. And until we have found a proper answer to the mystery, it's perfectly OK simply to say, ""This is something we don't yet understand, but we're working on it'. Indeed it is the only honest thing to do."
410,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23209335-sheryl,2,"I guess the fact that I was not this book's intended audience might have something to do with how little I liked it. Apparently it's meant for children/young adults? And apparently it's supposed to be illustrated?? Heads up - the paperback is not at all illustrated besides the small images at the start of each chapter. I really have no idea why you would even publish this book without the illustrations if it's meant to be a children/young adults' science book.I started out thinking that excerpts from this book would have been great required reading for a middle school/early high school science class (with the addition of illustrations, of course, to help drive the understanding home), but I quickly realized that that Dawkins's tone is just too condescending and rude for me to want to force that on anyone. Listen, I'm kind of on his side here, where I think understanding science is more ""magical"" than any religious explanation for things, but man, why you gotta be a jerk about it? I found a lot of his explanations lacking - though mainly that was due to the lack of illustrations in my copy. I was entirely dissatisfied with his explanation of sleep paralysis - don't be all, ""Alien abductions and other horror stories are from sleep paralysis, where people throughout the ages have all hallucinated the same thing"" without addressing the fact that it's HELLA WEIRD WE ALL HALLUCINATE THE SAME THING. Sleep paralysis is one of the few things that gets me borderline believing in something ""supernatural"" because it's so freaking weird, and after forcing my way through this book and finally getting excited about actually learning something, I was let down pretty bad by his explanation or lack thereof.I also felt the structure of the book didn't hold up: the basic structure is ""Here's a religious belief/myth, here's the truth behind it"", but several times the chapter starts with ""Well, I couldn't find any myths about this, but let me explain it anyway."" Like...why? That's not the point of the book? Do you just want to explain something to hear yourself talk (er...write?)?I feel bad kind of bad because I ultimately agree with the premise of this book, but it was poorly executed, in my opinion. Maybe as a young preteen just discovering atheism, this would be more exciting. But for me, I thoroughly hated reading it."

I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead.

Many myths would not have created if proper science was already there. Most of the supernatural phenomena we hear about, we hear from our parents, they heard from their parents and so on. Science has already disproved many of them. One of the good takeaway from this book is, if something cannot be explained we do not have to assume that it happened super-naturally or by command of some God, rather we should tell to ourselves that we do know the answer yet, that is the answer is ""X"" , the big unknown.

It is about creating ideas which are not disproven, and the whole point of science is to find disproofs of all the existing understanding of science. Further, he really believes that science has to do with disproving ""myths"" such as creation myths. He fails to believe that these myths might be metaphorical, ""best explanations"" that people can come up with, and he uses really bizarre metaphorical language to explain science himself, which is very much worse in my mind than that was in my mind.

I will be requesting a copy for my 9th grade classroom. Kids are naturally curious and fascinated by how the world works. They're also susceptible to all kinds of nonsense, of course. This much-needed book fill s a gap between simplistic kids' books and adult science books. I like how he started each chapter focusing on a myth that in the past served as an explanation for a natural phenomenon. The not so good: His tone fluctuated so often that in some parts of the book he could have been explaining something to a 10 year old, in other parts he could easily have been speaking to a senior in high school. No consistency. This book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters."

For me, this leaves out the spiritual side of life, and those things we cannot yet, or perhaps ever will explain, and it takes the fun out of the read, and of life.No one, not even he, will find all the answers, and while he does acknowledge what he doesn't know at times, he also doesn't leave his door open to explanations other than scientific, which I am sympathetic to.I think I've learned all I can from him for now.(p.s.- I think HE should read the Biology of Belief and let his own thinking continue to grow up alongside it)"

O well!Beware all ye religious: Dawkins pulls no punches in asserting that most religion is unsubstantiated myth, and his tone (in writing this book for young people) will strike you as especially condescending. I enjoyed the work for the way Dawkins makes his point across such wide-ranging areas of science. Reality really is magical! I also learned: mules are sterile, rainbows are cool, and Newton + prisms put us all to shame. (Is there still something left to discover with a prism?)

438,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14515345-erin-britton,5,"Richard Dawkins’ The Magic of Reality begins with a question: if reality is everything that exists, then how do we know what exists? In many cases this question of existence can be answered easy by recourse to our five senses. Our ability to see, smell, touch, taste and hear provides us with effective means of establishing this reality. However, the question really is: if our senses cannot detect something directly, then how do we know if it’s real? Lots of things can be seen to fall within this puzzle, for example galaxies that are too far away to see, radio waves that cannot be detected by either our eyes or our ears, and even dinosaurs since they are no longer around to be detected by anything. The answer seems to be that we know all of these things exist due to various methods of often complex investigation, investigation that can ultimately be labelled as science.Of course, scientific investigation isn’t the only means of explaining the existence of things and so, before science stepped in with an answer, magic was often credited as being involved. The ancient Egyptians for example explained the existence of night by suggesting that the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. Likewise, the Japanese used to explain earthquakes as being caused when the giant catfish that carried the world on its back flipped its tail. These are clearly extraordinary, magical explanations. However, it could be said that a different kind of magic exists in the discovery of the real answers to question of why things happen. With The Magic of Reality Dawkins therefore seeks to demonstrate that the real would, as it can be understood scientifically, has a magic all of its own.In The Magic of Reality each chapter is dedicated to one particular aspect of reality – whether it be the sun or earthquakes or rainbows or the many species of animals that exists – and investigates how and why that particular thing has come to be. In the chapter concerning “Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?” for example, Dawkins examines the two great rhythms that dominate our lives. He begins with a couple of Aboriginal myths about the day-night cycle as well as the myth of Persephone, before detailing how the seasonal rhythm is explained by the yearly orbiting of the Earth around the sun at a distance of 93 million miles while the daily rhythm is explained by the Earth’s spinning round and round like a top.The Magic of Reality is an immensely interesting book. Richard Dawkins has taken a host of complex and vital topics and has explained them in a clear, concise manner that would suit both the layman and those with some scientific knowledge. Dawkins provides inspiring explanations of space, time, evolution and other matters within the realm of thought experiments and so uses The Magic of Reality to explain an amazingly wide range of natural phenomena. The breadth of topics covered is immense yet Dawkins’ clear explanative style ensures that all information is presented in an accurate and detailed yet straightforward manner that makes it a pleasure rather than a chore to read.One potential disappointment with this particular edition of The Magic of Reality is that it is a special text-only edition. The original hardback edition contained delightful and illuminating colour illustrations from Dave McKean [yes, of Hellblazer and Sandman fame]. The quality of the illustrations resulted in the hardback of The Magic of Reality being a truly beautiful as well as informative volume. It is intended to be a book that explains science in a clear and exuberant fashion that appeals to readers of all ages and the inclusion of the illustrations would have served to broaden its appeal, particularly to young readers. There is another, more expensive, paperback edition due out later this year and it seems likely that that one will be illustrated, so it’s worth considering which edition would be most suited to your particular interests.Despite having lamented the absence of illustrations, the strength of the text of The Magic of Reality must be reiterated. It is a real page-turner of a science book that grips the reader’s imagination from the very beginning and never fails to both enlighten and astonish. The Magic of Reality is an accessible guide to nearly all of the important questions about the nature of life and the universe."
439,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49908117-vijay-akhade,5,"I hope you agree that the truth has a magic of its own. The truth is more magical-in the best and most exciting sense of the word-than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.We may care about fairness and unfairness, but coins don't give a toss! Nor does the universe at large. Bad things happen because things happen. Whether they are bad or good from our point of view doesn't influence how likely it is that they will happen. Some people find it hard to accept this. They'd prefer to think that sinners get their comeuppance, that virtue is rewarded. Unfortunately the universe doesn't care what people prefer.Scientists don't stop at proposing a model: they then go on to test it. They say, 'If this model that I am imagining were true, we would expect to see such-and-such in the real world'. They predict what you""ll find if you do a particular experiment and make certain measurements. A successful model is one whose predictions come out right, especially if they survive the test of experiment. And if the predictions come out right, we hope it means that the model probably represents the truth, or at least a part of the truth.If these'holy books' really were written, or dictated, or inspired, by all-knowing gods, don't you think its odd that these gods said nothing about any of these important and useful things?Is there really life on other planets ? Nobody knows. If you forced me to give an opinion one way or the other, I'd say yes, and probably on millions of planets. But who cares about an opinion ? There is no direct evidence. One of the great virtues of science is that scientists know when they don't know the answer to something. They cheerfully admit that they don't know. Cheerfully, because not knowing the answer is an exciting challenge to try to find it. There is much that remains deeply mysterious, and it is not likely that we will ever uncover all the secrets of a universe as vast as ours: but, armed with science, we can at least ask sensible, meaningful questions about it and recognize credible answers when we find them. We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories : we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy.Don't ever be lazy enough-defeatist enough, cowardly enough-to say 'It must be supernatural'or 'It must be a miracle'. Say instead that it's a puzzle, it's strange, it's a challenge that we should rise to. Whether we rise to the challenge by questioning the truth of the observation, or by expanding our science in new and exciting directions, the proper and brave response to any such challenge is to tackle it head-on. And until we have found a proper answer to the mystery, it's perfectly OK simply to say, ""This is something we don't yet understand, but we're working on it'. Indeed it is the only honest thing to do."
440,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23209335-sheryl,2,"I guess the fact that I was not this book's intended audience might have something to do with how little I liked it. Apparently it's meant for children/young adults? And apparently it's supposed to be illustrated?? Heads up - the paperback is not at all illustrated besides the small images at the start of each chapter. I really have no idea why you would even publish this book without the illustrations if it's meant to be a children/young adults' science book.I started out thinking that excerpts from this book would have been great required reading for a middle school/early high school science class (with the addition of illustrations, of course, to help drive the understanding home), but I quickly realized that that Dawkins's tone is just too condescending and rude for me to want to force that on anyone. Listen, I'm kind of on his side here, where I think understanding science is more ""magical"" than any religious explanation for things, but man, why you gotta be a jerk about it? I found a lot of his explanations lacking - though mainly that was due to the lack of illustrations in my copy. I was entirely dissatisfied with his explanation of sleep paralysis - don't be all, ""Alien abductions and other horror stories are from sleep paralysis, where people throughout the ages have all hallucinated the same thing"" without addressing the fact that it's HELLA WEIRD WE ALL HALLUCINATE THE SAME THING. Sleep paralysis is one of the few things that gets me borderline believing in something ""supernatural"" because it's so freaking weird, and after forcing my way through this book and finally getting excited about actually learning something, I was let down pretty bad by his explanation or lack thereof.I also felt the structure of the book didn't hold up: the basic structure is ""Here's a religious belief/myth, here's the truth behind it"", but several times the chapter starts with ""Well, I couldn't find any myths about this, but let me explain it anyway."" Like...why? That's not the point of the book? Do you just want to explain something to hear yourself talk (er...write?)?I feel bad kind of bad because I ultimately agree with the premise of this book, but it was poorly executed, in my opinion. Maybe as a young preteen just discovering atheism, this would be more exciting. But for me, I thoroughly hated reading it."
441,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."

Dismissing the intelligence of your reader is tantamount to reducing their intelligence by refusing to give them opportunity to be intelligent. This book is full of weird sentences, statements that are tantamount to insulting your intelligence, etc. “They depend for their existence on” * “It May not be that all of these people are charlatans, it may be that some of them really believe they are talking to the dead” “Gene pools are not liquid. So what are they?” Really??? “Tectonic plates are not like the kind you eat off”. This book must be geared towards a 10 year old? There’s nothing in this you wouldn’t know if you had graduated high school. Nothing goes beyond basic science. Everything is glib. Everything leaves important details out. It’s difficult to respect this in any sense at all for an adult audience. However, I could see it being an excellent resource for children, it’s fast, poppy, fun, and over simplified to the point where you might have to add some additional information, but only for an interested reader or listener.

The author found a fascinating way to guide us through the origin of the universe, it's expansion and how all the natural phenomenons are occurring around us. In short, he tried to enrich and enhance our perception of reality by making us understand the underlying mechanism, and considering the general base of readers, he should be successful. To gain a simplistic yet firm understanding of our perceived reality, how it has affected our culturally diverse mindset throughout time, this book is a gem.

The myths are kind of fun, but I'm not convinced they added much. One thing I do enjoy about reading Dawkins is that he does come up with different sorts of metaphors/analogies to explain concepts than are generally presented in classroom/textbook settings and often re-words and re-reasons things in a way that can help me understand them more fully.

I will be requesting a copy for my 9th grade classroom. Kids are naturally curious and fascinated by how the world works. They're also susceptible to all kinds of nonsense, of course. This much-needed book fill s a gap between simplistic kids' books and adult science books. I like how he started each chapter focusing on a myth that in the past served as an explanation for a natural phenomenon. The not so good: His tone fluctuated so often that in some parts of the book he could have been explaining something to a 10 year old, in other parts he could easily have been speaking to a senior in high school. No consistency. This book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters."

For me, this leaves out the spiritual side of life, and those things we cannot yet, or perhaps ever will explain, and it takes the fun out of the read, and of life.No one, not even he, will find all the answers, and while he does acknowledge what he doesn't know at times, he also doesn't leave his door open to explanations other than scientific, which I am sympathetic to.I think I've learned all I can from him for now.(p.s.- I think HE should read the Biology of Belief and let his own thinking continue to grow up alongside it)"

O well!Beware all ye religious: Dawkins pulls no punches in asserting that most religion is unsubstantiated myth, and his tone (in writing this book for young people) will strike you as especially condescending. I enjoyed the work for the way Dawkins makes his point across such wide-ranging areas of science. Reality really is magical! I also learned: mules are sterile, rainbows are cool, and Newton + prisms put us all to shame. (Is there still something left to discover with a prism?) I also have a new appreciation for the microscope and the way it reveals major plot holes in all major religions for failing to address phenomenon hidden from the naked eye.Curious about the illustrated version!"

468,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14515345-erin-britton,5,"Richard Dawkins’ The Magic of Reality begins with a question: if reality is everything that exists, then how do we know what exists? In many cases this question of existence can be answered easy by recourse to our five senses. Our ability to see, smell, touch, taste and hear provides us with effective means of establishing this reality. However, the question really is: if our senses cannot detect something directly, then how do we know if it’s real? Lots of things can be seen to fall within this puzzle, for example galaxies that are too far away to see, radio waves that cannot be detected by either our eyes or our ears, and even dinosaurs since they are no longer around to be detected by anything. The answer seems to be that we know all of these things exist due to various methods of often complex investigation, investigation that can ultimately be labelled as science.Of course, scientific investigation isn’t the only means of explaining the existence of things and so, before science stepped in with an answer, magic was often credited as being involved. The ancient Egyptians for example explained the existence of night by suggesting that the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. Likewise, the Japanese used to explain earthquakes as being caused when the giant catfish that carried the world on its back flipped its tail. These are clearly extraordinary, magical explanations. However, it could be said that a different kind of magic exists in the discovery of the real answers to question of why things happen. With The Magic of Reality Dawkins therefore seeks to demonstrate that the real would, as it can be understood scientifically, has a magic all of its own.In The Magic of Reality each chapter is dedicated to one particular aspect of reality – whether it be the sun or earthquakes or rainbows or the many species of animals that exists – and investigates how and why that particular thing has come to be. In the chapter concerning “Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?” for example, Dawkins examines the two great rhythms that dominate our lives. He begins with a couple of Aboriginal myths about the day-night cycle as well as the myth of Persephone, before detailing how the seasonal rhythm is explained by the yearly orbiting of the Earth around the sun at a distance of 93 million miles while the daily rhythm is explained by the Earth’s spinning round and round like a top.The Magic of Reality is an immensely interesting book. Richard Dawkins has taken a host of complex and vital topics and has explained them in a clear, concise manner that would suit both the layman and those with some scientific knowledge. Dawkins provides inspiring explanations of space, time, evolution and other matters within the realm of thought experiments and so uses The Magic of Reality to explain an amazingly wide range of natural phenomena. The breadth of topics covered is immense yet Dawkins’ clear explanative style ensures that all information is presented in an accurate and detailed yet straightforward manner that makes it a pleasure rather than a chore to read.One potential disappointment with this particular edition of The Magic of Reality is that it is a special text-only edition. The original hardback edition contained delightful and illuminating colour illustrations from Dave McKean [yes, of Hellblazer and Sandman fame]. The quality of the illustrations resulted in the hardback of The Magic of Reality being a truly beautiful as well as informative volume. It is intended to be a book that explains science in a clear and exuberant fashion that appeals to readers of all ages and the inclusion of the illustrations would have served to broaden its appeal, particularly to young readers. There is another, more expensive, paperback edition due out later this year and it seems likely that that one will be illustrated, so it’s worth considering which edition would be most suited to your particular interests.Despite having lamented the absence of illustrations, the strength of the text of The Magic of Reality must be reiterated. It is a real page-turner of a science book that grips the reader’s imagination from the very beginning and never fails to both enlighten and astonish. The Magic of Reality is an accessible guide to nearly all of the important questions about the nature of life and the universe."
469,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49908117-vijay-akhade,5,"I hope you agree that the truth has a magic of its own. The truth is more magical-in the best and most exciting sense of the word-than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.We may care about fairness and unfairness, but coins don't give a toss! Nor does the universe at large. Bad things happen because things happen. Whether they are bad or good from our point of view doesn't influence how likely it is that they will happen. Some people find it hard to accept this. They'd prefer to think that sinners get their comeuppance, that virtue is rewarded. Unfortunately the universe doesn't care what people prefer.Scientists don't stop at proposing a model: they then go on to test it. They say, 'If this model that I am imagining were true, we would expect to see such-and-such in the real world'. They predict what you""ll find if you do a particular experiment and make certain measurements. A successful model is one whose predictions come out right, especially if they survive the test of experiment. And if the predictions come out right, we hope it means that the model probably represents the truth, or at least a part of the truth.If these'holy books' really were written, or dictated, or inspired, by all-knowing gods, don't you think its odd that these gods said nothing about any of these important and useful things?Is there really life on other planets ? Nobody knows. If you forced me to give an opinion one way or the other, I'd say yes, and probably on millions of planets. But who cares about an opinion ? There is no direct evidence. One of the great virtues of science is that scientists know when they don't know the answer to something. They cheerfully admit that they don't know. Cheerfully, because not knowing the answer is an exciting challenge to try to find it. There is much that remains deeply mysterious, and it is not likely that we will ever uncover all the secrets of a universe as vast as ours: but, armed with science, we can at least ask sensible, meaningful questions about it and recognize credible answers when we find them. We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories : we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy.Don't ever be lazy enough-defeatist enough, cowardly enough-to say 'It must be supernatural'or 'It must be a miracle'. Say instead that it's a puzzle, it's strange, it's a challenge that we should rise to. Whether we rise to the challenge by questioning the truth of the observation, or by expanding our science in new and exciting directions, the proper and brave response to any such challenge is to tackle it head-on. And until we have found a proper answer to the mystery, it's perfectly OK simply to say, ""This is something we don't yet understand, but we're working on it'. Indeed it is the only honest thing to do."
470,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23209335-sheryl,2,"I guess the fact that I was not this book's intended audience might have something to do with how little I liked it. Apparently it's meant for children/young adults? And apparently it's supposed to be illustrated?? Heads up - the paperback is not at all illustrated besides the small images at the start of each chapter. I really have no idea why you would even publish this book without the illustrations if it's meant to be a children/young adults' science book.I started out thinking that excerpts from this book would have been great required reading for a middle school/early high school science class (with the addition of illustrations, of course, to help drive the understanding home), but I quickly realized that that Dawkins's tone is just too condescending and rude for me to want to force that on anyone. Listen, I'm kind of on his side here, where I think understanding science is more ""magical"" than any religious explanation for things, but man, why you gotta be a jerk about it? I found a lot of his explanations lacking - though mainly that was due to the lack of illustrations in my copy. I was entirely dissatisfied with his explanation of sleep paralysis - don't be all, ""Alien abductions and other horror stories are from sleep paralysis, where people throughout the ages have all hallucinated the same thing"" without addressing the fact that it's HELLA WEIRD WE ALL HALLUCINATE THE SAME THING. Sleep paralysis is one of the few things that gets me borderline believing in something ""supernatural"" because it's so freaking weird, and after forcing my way through this book and finally getting excited about actually learning something, I was let down pretty bad by his explanation or lack thereof.I also felt the structure of the book didn't hold up: the basic structure is ""Here's a religious belief/myth, here's the truth behind it"", but several times the chapter starts with ""Well, I couldn't find any myths about this, but let me explain it anyway."" Like...why? That's not the point of the book? Do you just want to explain something to hear yourself talk (er...write?)?I feel bad kind of bad because I ultimately agree with the premise of this book, but it was poorly executed, in my opinion. Maybe as a young preteen just discovering atheism, this would be more exciting. But for me, I thoroughly hated reading it."
471,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."

Ego still flares and I bristle. It’s annoying being talked to in this way. Does anyone enjoy the tone of this book? Could we not just agree that the human brain is at face value a beautiful thing? Dismissing the intelligence of your reader is tantamount to reducing their intelligence by refusing to give them opportunity to be intelligent. This book is full of weird sentences, statements that are tantamount to insulting your intelligence, etc. “They depend for their existence on” * “It May not be that all of these people are charlatans, it may be that some of them really believe they are talking to the dead” “Gene pools are not liquid. So what are they?” Really??? “Tectonic plates are not like the kind you eat off”. This book must be geared towards a 10 year old? There’s nothing in this you wouldn’t know if you had graduated high school. Nothing goes beyond basic science. Everything is glib. Everything leaves important details out. It’s difficult to respect this in any sense at all for an adult audience. However, I could see it being an excellent resource for children, it’s fast, poppy, fun, and over simplified to the point where you might have to add some additional information, but only for an interested reader or listener.

The author found a fascinating way to guide us through the origin of the universe, it's expansion and how all the natural phenomenons are occurring around us. In short, he tried to enrich and enhance our perception of reality by making us understand the underlying mechanism, and considering the general base of readers, he should be successful. To gain a simplistic yet firm understanding of our perceived reality, how it has affected our culturally diverse mindset throughout time, this book is a gem. But what amazes me most is that this book instills a sense of gratitude. It reminds us how insignificant we are in this universe yet how lucky we are to be a part of this majestic existence."

It certainly is not really for those with a background in science or engineering. Ironically, those are the type of folks who would be most interested in reading a book by Dawkins... and they are quite likely to already be well-versed in the basic biology/geology/astronomy that Dawkins presents. The myths are kind of fun, but I'm not convinced they added much. One thing I do enjoy about reading Dawkins is that he does come up with different sorts of metaphors/analogies to explain concepts than are generally presented in classroom/textbook settings and often re-words and re-reasons things in a way that can help me understand them more fully. Alas, this book did not contain much material of that nature."

This does not mean that an adult will find the book boring. On the contrary, the clear and concise writing makes it a refreshing read.The book essentially is a set of twelve questions and their scientific answers. Dawkins begins the answer to every question by describing the ancient myths (which are very funny BTW) that were made up in an attempt to answer the questions. He then goes on and explains the actual answer as given by science. Essentially, he goes on to show that the scientific truths, once understood, are more magical than any supernatural answer."

The purpose of myths is talking in a metaphorical and poetic way. Trying 'understand' reality by being very literally saying that myths are wrong or reality or saying that you have the ultimate truth thanks to science is being completely unscientific and arrogant. Real scientific people are as curious, religious and love metaphors because life and the world Can't really be explained.Coming from the engineering world I still learned a few things about optics and science, not more than that."

Great for highschoolers looking to familiarise themselves with basic concepts; if you're one, go for it!The comparison between modes of explaining (naive/folk vs science) lacks depth (Dawkins merely notes that it is interesting how easily the former prevail); I was also hoping to hear Dawkins's own experiences in transcendental/exhilarating thoughts arising from nonmagical thinking (Dawkins does praise the mind-expansion of discovering the electromagnetic spectrum.)"

It describes well how the myths are created through different cultures and scriptures when mankind was more busy with survival than scientific exploration of any kind. Many myths would not have created if proper science was already there. Most of the supernatural phenomena we hear about, we hear from our parents, they heard from their parents and so on. Science has already disproved many of them. One of the good takeaway from this book is, if something cannot be explained we do not have to assume that it happened super-naturally or by command of some God, rather we should tell to ourselves that we do know the answer yet, that is the answer is ""X"" , the big unknown. Actually, ""X"" the Unknown should be the default answer to any question until we know the answer. The audio book narration was great. "

If only I had absorbed as much when I learned this stuff the first time.Perhaps more interesting is Dawkins's use of myths to introduce each chapter and provide a contrast to reality. It's clear that Dawkins, a noted atheist, has a point to make here. It's actually kind of funny/bizarre to read sentences like ""A Jewish legend tells how two cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, were destroyed by the Hebrew god because the people who lived there were so wicked,"" when you grew up hearing these stories told as if they were fact and as if God were ""God"" and not just one of many. I get what he's trying to do, but the approach still left me a bit cold even though I am no longer religious. While its obviously no longer reasonable to believe these myths as literal explanations of the physical world, Dawkins neglects their emotional heft and I found his attitude a bit flip."

496,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56464474-jay-collins,3,It was good but not the best book by him. Some of the stuff in it is new but some it just rehashed from his other books. Still worth the read if you liked his other books but just not as ground breaking as some of his others books.
497,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7032663-eric-wojciechowski,5,"If you don't know much about the nature of things; such as, that the Earth goes around the sun (an astonishing third of United States populace think the reverse), don't know that the Earth is four-and-a-half-billion-years-old (some still say six-thousand) or that all creatures on Earth are related to a common ancestor rather than poofing into existence, exactly as we are today, then this is the book for you. If you think “luck” has anything to do with outcomes, or if miracles occur, this is an excellent book to start with. Written for novices on such subject matters, and young adults, Richard Dawkins takes the sum of much of his other work (and that of others) and dials it down to fit a wider audience. This is an excellent and accessible collection of answers to origins, what things are made of (atoms), why do Earthquakes happen, what is the sun, etc. And while I consider myself to be knowledgeable in these areas (enough to get by, anyhow), I considered this work a nice refresher and worth the read.What I like about Mr. Dawkins is his ability to communicate these subjects on par with Carl Sagan. A scientist who can remove the equations and give us the facts, complete with examples and models (while the equations are there for further study if you wish). Mr. Dawkins also writes like he speaks. I'm rather certain he follows the writing rule to read out loud what you write. Does it sound good? If not, then re-write it. I can hear his voice as I'm reading this work, complete with British accent. What I enjoyed most was the subject of who was the first person. Probably because my five-year-old-daughter has been asking this one. The thought experiment given by Mr. Dawkins of taking a picture of yourself, then laying your father's picture on top, then grandfather, then great-grandfather and so on, (having to eventually imagine pictures of great-great-greats for lack of photos), the line up of photographs would be forty-miles long and total 185 million greats (or grancestors) to get back to when your ancestor was something of a fish. You could walk along this forty-mile length of pictures, pulling out groups here and there and see that pictures near each other would look alike, but pictures, say at the five-mile mark would be a completely different species than at the fifteen-mile mark. There was no first person. Little changes grow to big changes but lots of time is needed. It's the nature of the beast, if you will.And to understand this concept further, Mr. Dawkins shows us how language changes. Groups of people wander away from each other, both with the same language and dialect. But over time, words are added, dropped, changed in both groups. If enough time goes by, if the two should meet again, they wouldn't understand each other. Or maybe they would but it would be difficult. I'm personally thinking of how hard a time I have reading Shakespeare. Surely it's English but an English I'm not familiar with.In the age of Wikipedia, answers can be obtained quickly. So if you come away from this work wanting to know more, it's readily accessible. If you're new to these subjects or like a quick refresher on them, I recommend the Magic of Reality. Especially if you have young kids who need the answers, who ask these questions about firsts. Because that's when humans ask the most of them and, in my opinion, need correct answers. Because fixing bad answers is harder the longer a child retains them."

499,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3134966-sasha-martinez,0,"Had been reading this on and off, mostly in bursts, really; the book, though fun, tends to be a mind-numbing cascade of information. Sanity must be preserved: The book breaks down complex scientific truths more manageably, but, you know, brain hurt happens.The book’s written for a younger crowd, and I believe Dawkins wanted this to stand alongside [if not in place of] storybooks on myth-making heroes and fairytales. And, sure, bibles and their parables. But the grumpy atheist we’ve come to know in Dawkins is muted. He’s just this midly-peeved, impatient, and ultimately dismissive aura hovering over all the science-yum. (I’ve noticed, though, an awkwardness to the voice—but perhaps I’ve read him when he’s let loose, when he doesn’t need to temper?)The focus is on Science and its many wonders, even though, yes, the argument for each chapter is grounded on dismantling myth and religion. [No, silly, some blonde sun-god does not pull a chariot across the sky—the earth revolves on its axis!] Myth, Dawkins keeps repeating, came to be in the days of yore because of an ignorance not through our own fault. We weren’t capable then of the best answers to our questions, not yet. But to continue believing in these myths [i.e., religion]—to accept them as fact, despite the evidence that science offers—despite science assiduously, even gleefully, searching for the answers—just makes one a dodo. (That’s the Dawkins I know.)Dawkins wants me to raise a skeptical child—yes, I’d like to keep this in my shelves, within easy reach of some little monster, eventually. A child who believes in fact, embraces speculations, but relies on logic, evidence, and common sense—without sacrificing an imagination that’s the very foundation of these vast myths he’s dismissively disassembled. A child who’d rather lose himself in the wonder of reality, one ceaselessly amazing because it what is true. (It’s why I like science so much: It assuages your curiosity, and it keeps reminding you how everything makes sense, because the world has rules—serendipity that abounds, the awe-inspiring logic of different grades of intricacy.)Well, at least I hope that’s what he wants. Either way, that’s what I plan to do to little creatures—the gods be willing, and all that jazz. In the meantime, I’m happy to do that myself. [ETA: I admit to rethinking this read-to-a-young’un thing. See, when I was a child, I read this kid's encyclopedia that talked about how the sun would burn itself up, how all life would suffer as a consequence, how everything would subsequently perish. ""In a billion years"" was not a consolation. I carried that knowledge inside me for so long, and I couldn't tell anyone because they were supposed to already know.]A tip: If you’re going to get one for keeps, do find the hardcover copy I have, the one that’s sure to have Dave McKean’s breathtakingly clever illustrations in color. This would have been less of a fun book if it weren’t for the art. Dave McKean, and a science delivered—argued—by Dawkins? Delicious. Just brain-hurty deliciousness."
500,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8795422-william,4,Richard Dawkins is an accomplished scientist with many esteemed publications. He is also a well known apologist for the atheist community. What he has attempted in this book is the debunking of religious explanations for natural phenomenon and the promotion of scientific solutions to those same mysteries. He did an admiral job covering his topic but I must admit I did not feel any magic. He would alternate between a religious or mythological explanation of the big questions of existence then offer sciences take on the subject. In terms of the science he has essentially presented us with an elementary science textbook which covers a wide array of subjects while steering away from the more complicated topics. He makes the mistake of chiding the religious fundamentalist for their views on the sanctity of their beliefs when he doesn't need to. I feel they will fall apart of their own accord. I recommend this book simply because it is written in Dawkins clear and engaging prose. I don't think it will draw too many fundamentalistsu away from the comfort of their beliefs but it does carry on with the triumph of the age of reason.
501,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,3,"Oh, how my 12-year-old self would have been delighted to have this little gem of a science book in her bookcase! With  The Magic of Reality, biologist and writer Richard Dawkins explores the scientific method, the difference between reality and magic, and looks for the answers to some of life’s most imminent questions (“Who was the first person?”, “What are things made of?”, “When and how did everything begin?”, etc.).Each chapter starts off with a main question that needs answering, followed by a mythical story used to explain said question in older times, and then followed up with the actual scientific answer. The tone is light and easy to understand, and it’s a perfect book for curious kids who want to know how the world/the universe works but aren’t ready for adult science books yet. As such, it doesn’t go too deep into scientific theory – not a problem in my opinion, since it’s more than enough for kids and will get that wow-teach-me-more-about-science!-spark burning anyway.Next to finding the scientific answers to a couple of very interesting questions, one of Dawkins’ main points is to distinguish between myth, magic, and make-believe, and the actual reality that can be mapped through scientific experiments. He emphasises critical and sceptical thinking, showing how the scientific method is a much better way of approaching and solving problems than just making up stories about some gods up in the sky. And as always, he also notes that reality itself, uncovered through and by science, is already magical and fantastical enough in and of itself – we don’t even need those mythological stories. Hence, the title.As of now, I doubt anybody is unaware of Dawkins’ stance on religion, and though his dislike of it does seep through a little (foolish humans always using silly stories to explain naturally occurring phenomena when they could be using science!), it isn’t as obvious as usual. Probably because the group this book is aimed towards is a little younger than Dawkins’ standard audience. Anyhow, it didn’t bother me nor did I feel he was making fun of myths in general – all he seemed to be saying was that they provide an outdated view.I’m all for making kids enthusiastic about science, and this book definitely does that. As an adult, it was an enjoyable read for me as well – the light tone and passion of it shine through."
502,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5622607-jukka-s-rkij-rvi,4,"Let me begin by saying that I did not, to my knowledge, read the best edition of the book. The edition I read was a small mass-market paperback, and Dave McKean's doubtlessly beautiful artwork was reduced to smudged greyscale thumbnails that would not have done justice to Martínez's Ecce Homo. It is the only major flaw I can find in the book.The Magic of Reality is written for a pre-teen audience, which is reflected in the language. However, the simple, handholding approach works for an older reader as well, especially in the case of some of the more complex concepts.Here, Dawkins walks the reader through such myriad basic science topics as evolution, genetics, the change of seasons and motion of the planets. Most of the content was already familiar to me, but I am not a scientist, so even there my understanding was deepened. To me, the big thing in the book was the explanation of the function of the spectroscope, redshifting and how the date of the Big Bang was arrived to. Fascinating stuff.Dawkins also displays humility in the occasional admission that this or that thing is outside of his area of expertise and even he does not understand it. Quantum physics springs to mind. However, he commits a significant linguistic gaffe by listing the languages of Romansch, Galician, Occitan and Catalan as dialects, which is linguistically suspect and comes with enough political baggage to choke a horse. Hell, Romansch is an official language in Switzerland, fulfilling even the armey un flot definition. Not much of a flot, admittedly, but it exists.Each chapter of the book opens with a series of mythical tales from around the world, illustrating the history of attempts to explain where we come from, where we're going, or what's that big shiny thing up there in the sky. These are occasionally interesting, but by and large, it is my feeling that Dawkins is at his best when he stays out of the humanities and in the hard sciences, where his expertise lies.All told, The Magic of Reality is a quick, entertaining and educational read. Just get the full-colour edition, because doing this to Dave McKean is a crime against art."
503,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This is one of the few books that I would consider comparing to Asimov's writing, particularly for youth. He explains clearly many things about science. This is NOT a book to read if you are religious or believe in astrology, etc! He completely dismisses religion's ability to actually explain things today. I especially liked one of the final chapters dealing with luck. He explains what the law of averages really mean, and why it is silly to assume someone is a lucky or unlucky person or due to have some good luck after a lot of bad luck. He also talks about the impossibility of miracles using a famous one as example. Did I mention you won't like this book if you are religious? He covers a LOT of basic science. In fact I was thinking that the book could easily be used by a middle grade science teacher as one of the textbooks. Probably not the only textbook since by the general nature of covering quite a few different branches of science, a lot of it is not in depth science. He also gives you a way of evaluating whether something is believable, which would be useful for many of us. He is passionate that not only is science the proper way to view the world, it is also the most beautiful, magical way to view the world. He uses the definition of magic as poetic in the title. If you have youngsters, particularly if you live in a conservative, religious area that is limiting what science can be taught, this book is a must to buy, read and discuss with those youngsters! It may also have the effect of helping kids to realize how fascinating science is and consider taking it up as a career!"
504,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12809503-david-powell,5,"Having read some of the other reviews, I think that some people have the wrong perception of this excellent book. I am not sure that some of the reviewers even got the point of the book. It is not an introduction to science for children no matter how it was advertised. While is is true that the book seems somewhat condescending at times to anyone with some knowledge of science, it is a delineation between what is mythology and what is science (or fact). If one thinks about it, religion happens to be the particular mythology that any given person believes in. For this reason, the crushing challenge that Dawkins brings against religion's explanations for why things are is likely to step upon people's spiritual toes. Every mythology has its roots, in my opinion, in primitive people's need to know about first cause, natural events, and life and death. A simple exercise in imagination can see some primitive people approaching a tribal chief or witchdoctor with exactly those questions, and to extend the image further, the chief or witchdoctor, to maintain his credibility, has to quickly come up with clever, engaging explanations for why we die or why the sun comes up in the morning. My guess it that every mythology began this way. I would bet that Dawkins would agree. You will be, to be sure, reschooled in science, but you will be given a chance to see how silly primitive myths are in today's world. (I read the paperback version which apparently lacks much of the illustration that was discussed in earlier reviews of the hardback version.)"
505,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5923392-diana,5,"Might be my favorite Dawkins book so far. It's certainly the only one I finished in under 24 hrs.I absolutely adored the last 2 chapters about probability and miracles. I laughed out loud in a public place when I got to the lone Scotsman practicing the bagpipes. I have previously read The God Delusion, The Selfish Gene, The Ancestor's Tale, and The Blind Watchmaker, and they had left me thinking that Dawkins' strengths lie in explaining biology and debating political/sociological issues, but that his divergence towards physics or related fields were not as successful. While his biology for example left me fascinated, his explanations of physics concepts are usually understandable but very barren. In this book, however, Dawkins' talks of the prism and the spectroscope for example were simply mesmerizing. Maybe it's because his target audience was younger people so he had to change his tone from explaining-how-things-work to explaining-why-things-are-awesome and you could feel his excitement for these concepts just like his passion for biology is always palpable.Another lovely thing about this book is Dawkins' treatment of the myth sections. While he usually treats mythology and religion as the unfortunate but inevitable product of evolution and sociology, in his book here, he approached them from an anthropological point of view. While maintaining that they are categorically false and poor explanations for reality, he did give them some respect as nice pieces of culture, literature and history."
506,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30594288-arunbalaji-mohanraj,5,"A wonderful book by Richard Dawkins to explain what is the real science behind everything that we believe as magic. This book is all about the myth that we heard from our childhood in different terms and the real science or reasons behind it. I really liked the chapters where he discussed about who was the first person, what are things made of, what is the sun, rainbow and an earthquake. After reading this book, I got questions within myself about our universe and also understood many facts about our universe especially earth and stars from the other sources. I was really shocked to know that it would take thousands of years to reach our nearest star other than the sun. The evolutionary science explained in this book was quite interesting and he takes us through the biological science as the author is an evolutionary biologist on the chapters related to the first person. Also he well illustrated about the existence of life in other planets in the chapter - ""Are we alone."" Author explained each and every chapters with the myths as well as the science and I really enjoyed the science that came after each and every myths. At the beginning of the book, I felt it as quite boring however after few chapters the book was really interesting and I feel like I should read it once again. I would recommend this book for everyone as there are many interesting facts about our universe that we should know for sure."
507,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40677420-hugh-dunnett,4,"An excellent young adult/introductory guide to major themes in science. Dawkins is a superb writer with a talent for describing scientific topics in a way to make them enjoyable and quite comprehensible to all. The areas of science covered are fairly broad in range but specific enough to allow a genuine developing of understanding. Further to this, Dave McKean’s illustrations are frequently breath-taking and genuinely illuminating. This is as much McKean’s book as it is Dawkins’.The novel idea in this introduction to science is to touch on ancient myths and then to speak of the science, the reality behind the myth. This could have added something of a nuanced and unusual flavour to the book. However I felt that the often rather shoehorned inclusion at the start of most chapters of ancient beliefs and myths, often obscure to the point of being well without the everyday readers’ consciousness doesn’t add much to the later revealed ‘magic’ of the scientific reality. Indeed, the only reason I can see for their inclusion is to build up to the final two chapters which have little to do with scientific method but appear to be included primarily to provide a platform to bash believer and belief. This Dawkins has done comprehensively in previous works and which wasn’t really required in this publication. It is a shame as the book would have been quite perfect without it."
508,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54322403-abdulrahman-alhamali,3,"The Magic or Reality by Richard Dawkins is a book that aims to explain the astonishing world around us through the lens of science. It presents several natural phenomena, and compares their scientific and mythical explanations. I enjoyed the book, and learned a lot of interesting facts, especially about biology, the specialty of Dawkins. But I did not enjoy two things: 1- The parts that were not about biology felt very ""reportive"". They just felt as if someone was telling me a lot of information with minimum explanation. 2- The ""reportive"" style of most of the chapters made the book kind of ironic for me; The book tries very hard to pitch the idea of abandoning religious and mythical explanations, but does that in a very ""religious"" way, where the author just presents facts with minimal explanation, and then says: This is what you should believe, not what you read in the religious books.I believe Dawkins could have done a much better job had he tried to write the book in a format that is more interactive and less reportive, or had he focused more on biology, where he most truly shines."

Questions like ""How do we know how far away things are in space?"" or ""Where did the dinosaurs go?""Love him or hate him, there's no denying that Professor Dawkins is a master of explaining difficult-to-grasp scientific concepts. Though I felt like I understood everything in the book pretty well before going through it, his explanations were all very easy to understand and well-argued.Each chapter of this book begins with some sort of mythology story, from all over the world. Dawkins focuses on how different peoples and different religions answer questions in various supernatural ways, and how now science can give us the answers that people have been searching for all this time. This book is not an attack on religion, like his most famous work: The God Delusion. Rather, it's like his less famous, but overall much better The Selfish Gene, or The Greatest Show on Earth. I recommend this book to everyone over the age of 10. At the VERY LEAST, it will make you think. And you will likely end up with a deeper understanding of fundamental scientific concepts. "

It's actually kind of funny/bizarre to read sentences like ""A Jewish legend tells how two cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, were destroyed by the Hebrew god because the people who lived there were so wicked,"" when you grew up hearing these stories told as if they were fact and as if God were ""God"" and not just one of many. I get what he's trying to do, but the approach still left me a bit cold even though I am no longer religious. While its obviously no longer reasonable to believe these myths as literal explanations of the physical world, Dawkins neglects their emotional heft and I found his attitude a bit flip."

526,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56464474-jay-collins,3,It was good but not the best book by him. Some of the stuff in it is new but some it just rehashed from his other books. Still worth the read if you liked his other books but just not as ground breaking as some of his others books.
527,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7032663-eric-wojciechowski,5,"If you don't know much about the nature of things; such as, that the Earth goes around the sun (an astonishing third of United States populace think the reverse), don't know that the Earth is four-and-a-half-billion-years-old (some still say six-thousand) or that all creatures on Earth are related to a common ancestor rather than poofing into existence, exactly as we are today, then this is the book for you. If you think “luck” has anything to do with outcomes, or if miracles occur, this is an excellent book to start with. Written for novices on such subject matters, and young adults, Richard Dawkins takes the sum of much of his other work (and that of others) and dials it down to fit a wider audience. This is an excellent and accessible collection of answers to origins, what things are made of (atoms), why do Earthquakes happen, what is the sun, etc. And while I consider myself to be knowledgeable in these areas (enough to get by, anyhow), I considered this work a nice refresher and worth the read.What I like about Mr. Dawkins is his ability to communicate these subjects on par with Carl Sagan. A scientist who can remove the equations and give us the facts, complete with examples and models (while the equations are there for further study if you wish). Mr. Dawkins also writes like he speaks. I'm rather certain he follows the writing rule to read out loud what you write. Does it sound good? If not, then re-write it. I can hear his voice as I'm reading this work, complete with British accent. What I enjoyed most was the subject of who was the first person. Probably because my five-year-old-daughter has been asking this one. The thought experiment given by Mr. Dawkins of taking a picture of yourself, then laying your father's picture on top, then grandfather, then great-grandfather and so on, (having to eventually imagine pictures of great-great-greats for lack of photos), the line up of photographs would be forty-miles long and total 185 million greats (or grancestors) to get back to when your ancestor was something of a fish. You could walk along this forty-mile length of pictures, pulling out groups here and there and see that pictures near each other would look alike, but pictures, say at the five-mile mark would be a completely different species than at the fifteen-mile mark. There was no first person. Little changes grow to big changes but lots of time is needed. It's the nature of the beast, if you will.And to understand this concept further, Mr. Dawkins shows us how language changes. Groups of people wander away from each other, both with the same language and dialect. But over time, words are added, dropped, changed in both groups. If enough time goes by, if the two should meet again, they wouldn't understand each other. Or maybe they would but it would be difficult. I'm personally thinking of how hard a time I have reading Shakespeare. Surely it's English but an English I'm not familiar with.In the age of Wikipedia, answers can be obtained quickly. So if you come away from this work wanting to know more, it's readily accessible. If you're new to these subjects or like a quick refresher on them, I recommend the Magic of Reality. Especially if you have young kids who need the answers, who ask these questions about firsts. Because that's when humans ask the most of them and, in my opinion, need correct answers. Because fixing bad answers is harder the longer a child retains them."

529,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3134966-sasha-martinez,0,"Had been reading this on and off, mostly in bursts, really; the book, though fun, tends to be a mind-numbing cascade of information. Sanity must be preserved: The book breaks down complex scientific truths more manageably, but, you know, brain hurt happens.The book’s written for a younger crowd, and I believe Dawkins wanted this to stand alongside [if not in place of] storybooks on myth-making heroes and fairytales. And, sure, bibles and their parables. But the grumpy atheist we’ve come to know in Dawkins is muted. He’s just this midly-peeved, impatient, and ultimately dismissive aura hovering over all the science-yum. (I’ve noticed, though, an awkwardness to the voice—but perhaps I’ve read him when he’s let loose, when he doesn’t need to temper?)The focus is on Science and its many wonders, even though, yes, the argument for each chapter is grounded on dismantling myth and religion. [No, silly, some blonde sun-god does not pull a chariot across the sky—the earth revolves on its axis!] Myth, Dawkins keeps repeating, came to be in the days of yore because of an ignorance not through our own fault. We weren’t capable then of the best answers to our questions, not yet. But to continue believing in these myths [i.e., religion]—to accept them as fact, despite the evidence that science offers—despite science assiduously, even gleefully, searching for the answers—just makes one a dodo. (That’s the Dawkins I know.)Dawkins wants me to raise a skeptical child—yes, I’d like to keep this in my shelves, within easy reach of some little monster, eventually. A child who believes in fact, embraces speculations, but relies on logic, evidence, and common sense—without sacrificing an imagination that’s the very foundation of these vast myths he’s dismissively disassembled. A child who’d rather lose himself in the wonder of reality, one ceaselessly amazing because it what is true. (It’s why I like science so much: It assuages your curiosity, and it keeps reminding you how everything makes sense, because the world has rules—serendipity that abounds, the awe-inspiring logic of different grades of intricacy.)Well, at least I hope that’s what he wants. Either way, that’s what I plan to do to little creatures—the gods be willing, and all that jazz. In the meantime, I’m happy to do that myself. [ETA: I admit to rethinking this read-to-a-young’un thing. See, when I was a child, I read this kid's encyclopedia that talked about how the sun would burn itself up, how all life would suffer as a consequence, how everything would subsequently perish. ""In a billion years"" was not a consolation. I carried that knowledge inside me for so long, and I couldn't tell anyone because they were supposed to already know.]A tip: If you’re going to get one for keeps, do find the hardcover copy I have, the one that’s sure to have Dave McKean’s breathtakingly clever illustrations in color. This would have been less of a fun book if it weren’t for the art. Dave McKean, and a science delivered—argued—by Dawkins? Delicious. Just brain-hurty deliciousness."
530,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8795422-william,4,Richard Dawkins is an accomplished scientist with many esteemed publications. He is also a well known apologist for the atheist community. What he has attempted in this book is the debunking of religious explanations for natural phenomenon and the promotion of scientific solutions to those same mysteries. He did an admiral job covering his topic but I must admit I did not feel any magic. He would alternate between a religious or mythological explanation of the big questions of existence then offer sciences take on the subject. In terms of the science he has essentially presented us with an elementary science textbook which covers a wide array of subjects while steering away from the more complicated topics. He makes the mistake of chiding the religious fundamentalist for their views on the sanctity of their beliefs when he doesn't need to. I feel they will fall apart of their own accord. I recommend this book simply because it is written in Dawkins clear and engaging prose. I don't think it will draw too many fundamentalistsu away from the comfort of their beliefs but it does carry on with the triumph of the age of reason.
531,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,3,"Oh, how my 12-year-old self would have been delighted to have this little gem of a science book in her bookcase! With  The Magic of Reality, biologist and writer Richard Dawkins explores the scientific method, the difference between reality and magic, and looks for the answers to some of life’s most imminent questions (“Who was the first person?”, “What are things made of?”, “When and how did everything begin?”, etc.).Each chapter starts off with a main question that needs answering, followed by a mythical story used to explain said question in older times, and then followed up with the actual scientific answer. The tone is light and easy to understand, and it’s a perfect book for curious kids who want to know how the world/the universe works but aren’t ready for adult science books yet. As such, it doesn’t go too deep into scientific theory – not a problem in my opinion, since it’s more than enough for kids and will get that wow-teach-me-more-about-science!-spark burning anyway.Next to finding the scientific answers to a couple of very interesting questions, one of Dawkins’ main points is to distinguish between myth, magic, and make-believe, and the actual reality that can be mapped through scientific experiments. He emphasises critical and sceptical thinking, showing how the scientific method is a much better way of approaching and solving problems than just making up stories about some gods up in the sky. And as always, he also notes that reality itself, uncovered through and by science, is already magical and fantastical enough in and of itself – we don’t even need those mythological stories. Hence, the title.As of now, I doubt anybody is unaware of Dawkins’ stance on religion, and though his dislike of it does seep through a little (foolish humans always using silly stories to explain naturally occurring phenomena when they could be using science!), it isn’t as obvious as usual. Probably because the group this book is aimed towards is a little younger than Dawkins’ standard audience. Anyhow, it didn’t bother me nor did I feel he was making fun of myths in general – all he seemed to be saying was that they provide an outdated view.I’m all for making kids enthusiastic about science, and this book definitely does that. As an adult, it was an enjoyable read for me as well – the light tone and passion of it shine through."
532,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5622607-jukka-s-rkij-rvi,4,"Let me begin by saying that I did not, to my knowledge, read the best edition of the book. The edition I read was a small mass-market paperback, and Dave McKean's doubtlessly beautiful artwork was reduced to smudged greyscale thumbnails that would not have done justice to Martínez's Ecce Homo. It is the only major flaw I can find in the book.The Magic of Reality is written for a pre-teen audience, which is reflected in the language. However, the simple, handholding approach works for an older reader as well, especially in the case of some of the more complex concepts.Here, Dawkins walks the reader through such myriad basic science topics as evolution, genetics, the change of seasons and motion of the planets. Most of the content was already familiar to me, but I am not a scientist, so even there my understanding was deepened. To me, the big thing in the book was the explanation of the function of the spectroscope, redshifting and how the date of the Big Bang was arrived to. Fascinating stuff.Dawkins also displays humility in the occasional admission that this or that thing is outside of his area of expertise and even he does not understand it. Quantum physics springs to mind. However, he commits a significant linguistic gaffe by listing the languages of Romansch, Galician, Occitan and Catalan as dialects, which is linguistically suspect and comes with enough political baggage to choke a horse. Hell, Romansch is an official language in Switzerland, fulfilling even the armey un flot definition. Not much of a flot, admittedly, but it exists.Each chapter of the book opens with a series of mythical tales from around the world, illustrating the history of attempts to explain where we come from, where we're going, or what's that big shiny thing up there in the sky. These are occasionally interesting, but by and large, it is my feeling that Dawkins is at his best when he stays out of the humanities and in the hard sciences, where his expertise lies.All told, The Magic of Reality is a quick, entertaining and educational read. Just get the full-colour edition, because doing this to Dave McKean is a crime against art."
533,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This is one of the few books that I would consider comparing to Asimov's writing, particularly for youth. He explains clearly many things about science. This is NOT a book to read if you are religious or believe in astrology, etc! He completely dismisses religion's ability to actually explain things today. I especially liked one of the final chapters dealing with luck. He explains what the law of averages really mean, and why it is silly to assume someone is a lucky or unlucky person or due to have some good luck after a lot of bad luck. He also talks about the impossibility of miracles using a famous one as example. Did I mention you won't like this book if you are religious? He covers a LOT of basic science. In fact I was thinking that the book could easily be used by a middle grade science teacher as one of the textbooks. Probably not the only textbook since by the general nature of covering quite a few different branches of science, a lot of it is not in depth science. He also gives you a way of evaluating whether something is believable, which would be useful for many of us. He is passionate that not only is science the proper way to view the world, it is also the most beautiful, magical way to view the world. He uses the definition of magic as poetic in the title. If you have youngsters, particularly if you live in a conservative, religious area that is limiting what science can be taught, this book is a must to buy, read and discuss with those youngsters! It may also have the effect of helping kids to realize how fascinating science is and consider taking it up as a career!"
534,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12809503-david-powell,5,"Having read some of the other reviews, I think that some people have the wrong perception of this excellent book. I am not sure that some of the reviewers even got the point of the book. It is not an introduction to science for children no matter how it was advertised. While is is true that the book seems somewhat condescending at times to anyone with some knowledge of science, it is a delineation between what is mythology and what is science (or fact). If one thinks about it, religion happens to be the particular mythology that any given person believes in. For this reason, the crushing challenge that Dawkins brings against religion's explanations for why things are is likely to step upon people's spiritual toes. Every mythology has its roots, in my opinion, in primitive people's need to know about first cause, natural events, and life and death. A simple exercise in imagination can see some primitive people approaching a tribal chief or witchdoctor with exactly those questions, and to extend the image further, the chief or witchdoctor, to maintain his credibility, has to quickly come up with clever, engaging explanations for why we die or why the sun comes up in the morning. My guess it that every mythology began this way. I would bet that Dawkins would agree. You will be, to be sure, reschooled in science, but you will be given a chance to see how silly primitive myths are in today's world. (I read the paperback version which apparently lacks much of the illustration that was discussed in earlier reviews of the hardback version.)"
535,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5923392-diana,5,"Might be my favorite Dawkins book so far. It's certainly the only one I finished in under 24 hrs.I absolutely adored the last 2 chapters about probability and miracles. I laughed out loud in a public place when I got to the lone Scotsman practicing the bagpipes. I have previously read The God Delusion, The Selfish Gene, The Ancestor's Tale, and The Blind Watchmaker, and they had left me thinking that Dawkins' strengths lie in explaining biology and debating political/sociological issues, but that his divergence towards physics or related fields were not as successful. While his biology for example left me fascinated, his explanations of physics concepts are usually understandable but very barren. In this book, however, Dawkins' talks of the prism and the spectroscope for example were simply mesmerizing. Maybe it's because his target audience was younger people so he had to change his tone from explaining-how-things-work to explaining-why-things-are-awesome and you could feel his excitement for these concepts just like his passion for biology is always palpable.Another lovely thing about this book is Dawkins' treatment of the myth sections. While he usually treats mythology and religion as the unfortunate but inevitable product of evolution and sociology, in his book here, he approached them from an anthropological point of view. While maintaining that they are categorically false and poor explanations for reality, he did give them some respect as nice pieces of culture, literature and history."
536,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30594288-arunbalaji-mohanraj,5,"A wonderful book by Richard Dawkins to explain what is the real science behind everything that we believe as magic. This book is all about the myth that we heard from our childhood in different terms and the real science or reasons behind it. I really liked the chapters where he discussed about who was the first person, what are things made of, what is the sun, rainbow and an earthquake. After reading this book, I got questions within myself about our universe and also understood many facts about our universe especially earth and stars from the other sources. I was really shocked to know that it would take thousands of years to reach our nearest star other than the sun. The evolutionary science explained in this book was quite interesting and he takes us through the biological science as the author is an evolutionary biologist on the chapters related to the first person. Also he well illustrated about the existence of life in other planets in the chapter - ""Are we alone."" Author explained each and every chapters with the myths as well as the science and I really enjoyed the science that came after each and every myths. At the beginning of the book, I felt it as quite boring however after few chapters the book was really interesting and I feel like I should read it once again. I would recommend this book for everyone as there are many interesting facts about our universe that we should know for sure."
537,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40677420-hugh-dunnett,4,"An excellent young adult/introductory guide to major themes in science. Dawkins is a superb writer with a talent for describing scientific topics in a way to make them enjoyable and quite comprehensible to all. The areas of science covered are fairly broad in range but specific enough to allow a genuine developing of understanding. Further to this, Dave McKean’s illustrations are frequently breath-taking and genuinely illuminating. This is as much McKean’s book as it is Dawkins’.The novel idea in this introduction to science is to touch on ancient myths and then to speak of the science, the reality behind the myth. This could have added something of a nuanced and unusual flavour to the book. However I felt that the often rather shoehorned inclusion at the start of most chapters of ancient beliefs and myths, often obscure to the point of being well without the everyday readers’ consciousness doesn’t add much to the later revealed ‘magic’ of the scientific reality. Indeed, the only reason I can see for their inclusion is to build up to the final two chapters which have little to do with scientific method but appear to be included primarily to provide a platform to bash believer and belief. This Dawkins has done comprehensively in previous works and which wasn’t really required in this publication. It is a shame as the book would have been quite perfect without it."
538,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54322403-abdulrahman-alhamali,3,"The Magic or Reality by Richard Dawkins is a book that aims to explain the astonishing world around us through the lens of science. It presents several natural phenomena, and compares their scientific and mythical explanations. I enjoyed the book, and learned a lot of interesting facts, especially about biology, the specialty of Dawkins. But I did not enjoy two things: 1- The parts that were not about biology felt very ""reportive"". They just felt as if someone was telling me a lot of information with minimum explanation. 2- The ""reportive"" style of most of the chapters made the book kind of ironic for me; The book tries very hard to pitch the idea of abandoning religious and mythical explanations, but does that in a very ""religious"" way, where the author just presents facts with minimal explanation, and then says: This is what you should believe, not what you read in the religious books.I believe Dawkins could have done a much better job had he tried to write the book in a format that is more interactive and less reportive, or had he focused more on biology, where he most truly shines."

Questions like ""How do we know how far away things are in space?"" or ""Where did the dinosaurs go?""Love him or hate him, there's no denying that Professor Dawkins is a master of explaining difficult-to-grasp scientific concepts. Though I felt like I understood everything in the book pretty well before going through it, his explanations were all very easy to understand and well-argued.Each chapter of this book begins with some sort of mythology story, from all over the world. Dawkins focuses on how different peoples and different religions answer questions in various supernatural ways, and how now science can give us the answers that people have been searching for all this time. This book is not an attack on religion, like his most famous work: The God Delusion. Rather, it's like his less famous, but overall much better The Selfish Gene, or The Greatest Show on Earth. I recommend this book to everyone over the age of 10. At the VERY LEAST, it will make you think. And you will likely end up with a deeper understanding of fundamental scientific concepts. "

I thought the explanations were very well done. Even though many of the topics touched on comes with an extensive set of alienating terminology, Dawkins generally sticks to straightforward language. Sometimes I felt he tried too hard to pit myhts and superstition against modern science. The sentiment was fine and he was respectful, I just found the angle tireing after a while. It felt a bit out of place considering the demographic.Anyone already interested in science, will probably be familiar with most of the concepts in this book. I think the bigger thing to take away from it is the merits of critical thinking and the beauty of reality in itself.

This is an excellent and accessible collection of answers to origins, what things are made of (atoms), why do Earthquakes happen, what is the sun, etc. And while I consider myself to be knowledgeable in these areas (enough to get by, anyhow), I considered this work a nice refresher and worth the read.What I like about Mr. Dawkins is his ability to communicate these subjects on par with Carl Sagan. A scientist who can remove the equations and give us the facts, complete with examples and models (while the equations are there for further study if you wish). Mr. Dawkins also writes like he speaks. I'm rather certain he follows the writing rule to read out loud what you write. Does it sound good? If not, then re-write it. I can hear his voice as I'm reading this work, complete with British accent. What I enjoyed most was the subject of who was the first person. Probably because my five-year-old-daughter has been asking this one. The thought experiment given by Mr. Dawkins of taking a picture of yourself, then laying your father's picture on top, then grandfather, then great-grandfather and so on, (having to eventually imagine pictures of great-great-greats for lack of photos), the line up of photographs would be forty-miles long and total 185 million greats (or grancestors) to get back to when your ancestor was something of a fish. You could walk along this forty-mile length of pictures, pulling out groups here and there and see that pictures near each other would look alike, but pictures, say at the five-mile mark would be a completely different species than at the fifteen-mile mark. There was no first person. Little changes grow to big changes but lots of time is needed. It's the nature of the beast, if you will.And to understand this concept further, Mr. Dawkins shows us how language changes. Groups of people wander away from each other, both with the same language and dialect. But over time, words are added, dropped, changed in both groups. If enough time goes by, if the two should meet again, they wouldn't understand each other. Or maybe they would but it would be difficult. I'm personally thinking of how hard a time I have reading Shakespeare. Surely it's English but an English I'm not familiar with.In the age of Wikipedia, answers can be obtained quickly. So if you come away from this work wanting to know more, it's readily accessible. If you're new to these subjects or like a quick refresher on them, I recommend the Magic of Reality. Especially if you have young kids who need the answers, who ask these questions about firsts. Because that's when humans ask the most of them and, in my opinion, need correct answers. Because fixing bad answers is harder the longer a child retains them."

559,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3134966-sasha-martinez,0,"Had been reading this on and off, mostly in bursts, really; the book, though fun, tends to be a mind-numbing cascade of information. Sanity must be preserved: The book breaks down complex scientific truths more manageably, but, you know, brain hurt happens.The book’s written for a younger crowd, and I believe Dawkins wanted this to stand alongside [if not in place of] storybooks on myth-making heroes and fairytales. And, sure, bibles and their parables. But the grumpy atheist we’ve come to know in Dawkins is muted. He’s just this midly-peeved, impatient, and ultimately dismissive aura hovering over all the science-yum. (I’ve noticed, though, an awkwardness to the voice—but perhaps I’ve read him when he’s let loose, when he doesn’t need to temper?)The focus is on Science and its many wonders, even though, yes, the argument for each chapter is grounded on dismantling myth and religion. [No, silly, some blonde sun-god does not pull a chariot across the sky—the earth revolves on its axis!] Myth, Dawkins keeps repeating, came to be in the days of yore because of an ignorance not through our own fault. We weren’t capable then of the best answers to our questions, not yet. But to continue believing in these myths [i.e., religion]—to accept them as fact, despite the evidence that science offers—despite science assiduously, even gleefully, searching for the answers—just makes one a dodo. (That’s the Dawkins I know.)Dawkins wants me to raise a skeptical child—yes, I’d like to keep this in my shelves, within easy reach of some little monster, eventually. A child who believes in fact, embraces speculations, but relies on logic, evidence, and common sense—without sacrificing an imagination that’s the very foundation of these vast myths he’s dismissively disassembled. A child who’d rather lose himself in the wonder of reality, one ceaselessly amazing because it what is true. (It’s why I like science so much: It assuages your curiosity, and it keeps reminding you how everything makes sense, because the world has rules—serendipity that abounds, the awe-inspiring logic of different grades of intricacy.)Well, at least I hope that’s what he wants. Either way, that’s what I plan to do to little creatures—the gods be willing, and all that jazz. In the meantime, I’m happy to do that myself. [ETA: I admit to rethinking this read-to-a-young’un thing. See, when I was a child, I read this kid's encyclopedia that talked about how the sun would burn itself up, how all life would suffer as a consequence, how everything would subsequently perish. ""In a billion years"" was not a consolation. I carried that knowledge inside me for so long, and I couldn't tell anyone because they were supposed to already know.]A tip: If you’re going to get one for keeps, do find the hardcover copy I have, the one that’s sure to have Dave McKean’s breathtakingly clever illustrations in color. This would have been less of a fun book if it weren’t for the art. Dave McKean, and a science delivered—argued—by Dawkins? Delicious. Just brain-hurty deliciousness."
560,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8795422-william,4,Richard Dawkins is an accomplished scientist with many esteemed publications. He is also a well known apologist for the atheist community. What he has attempted in this book is the debunking of religious explanations for natural phenomenon and the promotion of scientific solutions to those same mysteries. He did an admiral job covering his topic but I must admit I did not feel any magic. He would alternate between a religious or mythological explanation of the big questions of existence then offer sciences take on the subject. In terms of the science he has essentially presented us with an elementary science textbook which covers a wide array of subjects while steering away from the more complicated topics. He makes the mistake of chiding the religious fundamentalist for their views on the sanctity of their beliefs when he doesn't need to. I feel they will fall apart of their own accord. I recommend this book simply because it is written in Dawkins clear and engaging prose. I don't think it will draw too many fundamentalistsu away from the comfort of their beliefs but it does carry on with the triumph of the age of reason.
561,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,3,"Oh, how my 12-year-old self would have been delighted to have this little gem of a science book in her bookcase! With  The Magic of Reality, biologist and writer Richard Dawkins explores the scientific method, the difference between reality and magic, and looks for the answers to some of life’s most imminent questions (“Who was the first person?”, “What are things made of?”, “When and how did everything begin?”, etc.).Each chapter starts off with a main question that needs answering, followed by a mythical story used to explain said question in older times, and then followed up with the actual scientific answer. The tone is light and easy to understand, and it’s a perfect book for curious kids who want to know how the world/the universe works but aren’t ready for adult science books yet. As such, it doesn’t go too deep into scientific theory – not a problem in my opinion, since it’s more than enough for kids and will get that wow-teach-me-more-about-science!-spark burning anyway.Next to finding the scientific answers to a couple of very interesting questions, one of Dawkins’ main points is to distinguish between myth, magic, and make-believe, and the actual reality that can be mapped through scientific experiments. He emphasises critical and sceptical thinking, showing how the scientific method is a much better way of approaching and solving problems than just making up stories about some gods up in the sky. And as always, he also notes that reality itself, uncovered through and by science, is already magical and fantastical enough in and of itself – we don’t even need those mythological stories. Hence, the title.As of now, I doubt anybody is unaware of Dawkins’ stance on religion, and though his dislike of it does seep through a little (foolish humans always using silly stories to explain naturally occurring phenomena when they could be using science!), it isn’t as obvious as usual. Probably because the group this book is aimed towards is a little younger than Dawkins’ standard audience. Anyhow, it didn’t bother me nor did I feel he was making fun of myths in general – all he seemed to be saying was that they provide an outdated view.I’m all for making kids enthusiastic about science, and this book definitely does that. As an adult, it was an enjoyable read for me as well – the light tone and passion of it shine through."
562,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5622607-jukka-s-rkij-rvi,4,"Let me begin by saying that I did not, to my knowledge, read the best edition of the book. The edition I read was a small mass-market paperback, and Dave McKean's doubtlessly beautiful artwork was reduced to smudged greyscale thumbnails that would not have done justice to Martínez's Ecce Homo. It is the only major flaw I can find in the book.The Magic of Reality is written for a pre-teen audience, which is reflected in the language. However, the simple, handholding approach works for an older reader as well, especially in the case of some of the more complex concepts.Here, Dawkins walks the reader through such myriad basic science topics as evolution, genetics, the change of seasons and motion of the planets. Most of the content was already familiar to me, but I am not a scientist, so even there my understanding was deepened. To me, the big thing in the book was the explanation of the function of the spectroscope, redshifting and how the date of the Big Bang was arrived to. Fascinating stuff.Dawkins also displays humility in the occasional admission that this or that thing is outside of his area of expertise and even he does not understand it. Quantum physics springs to mind. However, he commits a significant linguistic gaffe by listing the languages of Romansch, Galician, Occitan and Catalan as dialects, which is linguistically suspect and comes with enough political baggage to choke a horse. Hell, Romansch is an official language in Switzerland, fulfilling even the armey un flot definition. Not much of a flot, admittedly, but it exists.Each chapter of the book opens with a series of mythical tales from around the world, illustrating the history of attempts to explain where we come from, where we're going, or what's that big shiny thing up there in the sky. These are occasionally interesting, but by and large, it is my feeling that Dawkins is at his best when he stays out of the humanities and in the hard sciences, where his expertise lies.All told, The Magic of Reality is a quick, entertaining and educational read. Just get the full-colour edition, because doing this to Dave McKean is a crime against art."
563,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This is one of the few books that I would consider comparing to Asimov's writing, particularly for youth. He explains clearly many things about science. This is NOT a book to read if you are religious or believe in astrology, etc! He completely dismisses religion's ability to actually explain things today. I especially liked one of the final chapters dealing with luck. He explains what the law of averages really mean, and why it is silly to assume someone is a lucky or unlucky person or due to have some good luck after a lot of bad luck. He also talks about the impossibility of miracles using a famous one as example. Did I mention you won't like this book if you are religious? He covers a LOT of basic science. In fact I was thinking that the book could easily be used by a middle grade science teacher as one of the textbooks. Probably not the only textbook since by the general nature of covering quite a few different branches of science, a lot of it is not in depth science. He also gives you a way of evaluating whether something is believable, which would be useful for many of us. He is passionate that not only is science the proper way to view the world, it is also the most beautiful, magical way to view the world. He uses the definition of magic as poetic in the title. If you have youngsters, particularly if you live in a conservative, religious area that is limiting what science can be taught, this book is a must to buy, read and discuss with those youngsters! It may also have the effect of helping kids to realize how fascinating science is and consider taking it up as a career!"
564,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12809503-david-powell,5,"Having read some of the other reviews, I think that some people have the wrong perception of this excellent book. I am not sure that some of the reviewers even got the point of the book. It is not an introduction to science for children no matter how it was advertised. While is is true that the book seems somewhat condescending at times to anyone with some knowledge of science, it is a delineation between what is mythology and what is science (or fact). If one thinks about it, religion happens to be the particular mythology that any given person believes in. For this reason, the crushing challenge that Dawkins brings against religion's explanations for why things are is likely to step upon people's spiritual toes. Every mythology has its roots, in my opinion, in primitive people's need to know about first cause, natural events, and life and death. A simple exercise in imagination can see some primitive people approaching a tribal chief or witchdoctor with exactly those questions, and to extend the image further, the chief or witchdoctor, to maintain his credibility, has to quickly come up with clever, engaging explanations for why we die or why the sun comes up in the morning. My guess it that every mythology began this way. I would bet that Dawkins would agree. You will be, to be sure, reschooled in science, but you will be given a chance to see how silly primitive myths are in today's world. (I read the paperback version which apparently lacks much of the illustration that was discussed in earlier reviews of the hardback version.)"
565,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5923392-diana,5,"Might be my favorite Dawkins book so far. It's certainly the only one I finished in under 24 hrs.I absolutely adored the last 2 chapters about probability and miracles. I laughed out loud in a public place when I got to the lone Scotsman practicing the bagpipes. I have previously read The God Delusion, The Selfish Gene, The Ancestor's Tale, and The Blind Watchmaker, and they had left me thinking that Dawkins' strengths lie in explaining biology and debating political/sociological issues, but that his divergence towards physics or related fields were not as successful. While his biology for example left me fascinated, his explanations of physics concepts are usually understandable but very barren. In this book, however, Dawkins' talks of the prism and the spectroscope for example were simply mesmerizing. Maybe it's because his target audience was younger people so he had to change his tone from explaining-how-things-work to explaining-why-things-are-awesome and you could feel his excitement for these concepts just like his passion for biology is always palpable.Another lovely thing about this book is Dawkins' treatment of the myth sections. While he usually treats mythology and religion as the unfortunate but inevitable product of evolution and sociology, in his book here, he approached them from an anthropological point of view. While maintaining that they are categorically false and poor explanations for reality, he did give them some respect as nice pieces of culture, literature and history."
566,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30594288-arunbalaji-mohanraj,5,"A wonderful book by Richard Dawkins to explain what is the real science behind everything that we believe as magic. This book is all about the myth that we heard from our childhood in different terms and the real science or reasons behind it. I really liked the chapters where he discussed about who was the first person, what are things made of, what is the sun, rainbow and an earthquake. After reading this book, I got questions within myself about our universe and also understood many facts about our universe especially earth and stars from the other sources. I was really shocked to know that it would take thousands of years to reach our nearest star other than the sun. The evolutionary science explained in this book was quite interesting and he takes us through the biological science as the author is an evolutionary biologist on the chapters related to the first person. Also he well illustrated about the existence of life in other planets in the chapter - ""Are we alone."" Author explained each and every chapters with the myths as well as the science and I really enjoyed the science that came after each and every myths. At the beginning of the book, I felt it as quite boring however after few chapters the book was really interesting and I feel like I should read it once again. I would recommend this book for everyone as there are many interesting facts about our universe that we should know for sure."
567,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40677420-hugh-dunnett,4,"An excellent young adult/introductory guide to major themes in science. Dawkins is a superb writer with a talent for describing scientific topics in a way to make them enjoyable and quite comprehensible to all. The areas of science covered are fairly broad in range but specific enough to allow a genuine developing of understanding. Further to this, Dave McKean’s illustrations are frequently breath-taking and genuinely illuminating. This is as much McKean’s book as it is Dawkins’.The novel idea in this introduction to science is to touch on ancient myths and then to speak of the science, the reality behind the myth. This could have added something of a nuanced and unusual flavour to the book. However I felt that the often rather shoehorned inclusion at the start of most chapters of ancient beliefs and myths, often obscure to the point of being well without the everyday readers’ consciousness doesn’t add much to the later revealed ‘magic’ of the scientific reality. Indeed, the only reason I can see for their inclusion is to build up to the final two chapters which have little to do with scientific method but appear to be included primarily to provide a platform to bash believer and belief. This Dawkins has done comprehensively in previous works and which wasn’t really required in this publication. It is a shame as the book would have been quite perfect without it."
568,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54322403-abdulrahman-alhamali,3,"The Magic or Reality by Richard Dawkins is a book that aims to explain the astonishing world around us through the lens of science. It presents several natural phenomena, and compares their scientific and mythical explanations. I enjoyed the book, and learned a lot of interesting facts, especially about biology, the specialty of Dawkins. But I did not enjoy two things: 1- The parts that were not about biology felt very ""reportive"". They just felt as if someone was telling me a lot of information with minimum explanation. 2- The ""reportive"" style of most of the chapters made the book kind of ironic for me; The book tries very hard to pitch the idea of abandoning religious and mythical explanations, but does that in a very ""religious"" way, where the author just presents facts with minimal explanation, and then says: This is what you should believe, not what you read in the religious books.I believe Dawkins could have done a much better job had he tried to write the book in a format that is more interactive and less reportive, or had he focused more on biology, where he most truly shines."
569,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5038234-dylan-armes,4,"After finishing this book, I told my wife we're finally ready to have kids, now that this book is around.Written at a junior high level, this was Richard Dawkins' attempt to write a book of general science that answers a lot of common questions from kids. Questions like ""How do we know how far away things are in space?"" or ""Where did the dinosaurs go?""Love him or hate him, there's no denying that Professor Dawkins is a master of explaining difficult-to-grasp scientific concepts. Though I felt like I understood everything in the book pretty well before going through it, his explanations were all very easy to understand and well-argued.Each chapter of this book begins with some sort of mythology story, from all over the world. Dawkins focuses on how different peoples and different religions answer questions in various supernatural ways, and how now science can give us the answers that people have been searching for all this time. This book is not an attack on religion, like his most famous work: The God Delusion. Rather, it's like his less famous, but overall much better The Selfish Gene, or The Greatest Show on Earth. I recommend this book to everyone over the age of 10. At the VERY LEAST, it will make you think. And you will likely end up with a deeper understanding of fundamental scientific concepts. "
570,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4101408-jigme-datse,2,"Richard Dawkins does not seem to understand science. He strongly believes that science will prove everything. Well, science is not really about proving anything in our normal understanding of the term. It is about creating ideas which are not disproven, and the whole point of science is to find disproofs of all the existing understanding of science. Further, he really believes that science has to do with disproving ""myths"" such as creation myths. He fails to believe that these myths might be metaphorical, ""best explanations"" that people can come up with, and he uses really bizarre metaphorical language to explain science himself, which is very much worse in my mind than that was in my mind. But, he *does* write well. He is good at telling a story which is easy to get engaged in. So, this aspect managed to get me through this book..."
571,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14115149-jaclynn,3,"Dawkins writes (and has illustrated) a book for teens? Count me in!The good: Clear and accessible. I will be requesting a copy for my 9th grade classroom. Kids are naturally curious and fascinated by how the world works. They're also susceptible to all kinds of nonsense, of course. This much-needed book fill s a gap between simplistic kids' books and adult science books. I like how he started each chapter focusing on a myth that in the past served as an explanation for a natural phenomenon. The not so good: His tone fluctuated so often that in some parts of the book he could have been explaining something to a 10 year old, in other parts he could easily have been speaking to a senior in high school. No consistency. This book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters."

For me, this leaves out the spiritual side of life, and those things we cannot yet, or perhaps ever will explain, and it takes the fun out of the read, and of life.No one, not even he, will find all the answers, and while he does acknowledge what he doesn't know at times, he also doesn't leave his door open to explanations other than scientific, which I am sympathetic to.I think I've learned all I can from him for now.(p.s.- I think HE should read the Biology of Belief and let his own thinking continue to grow up alongside it)"

O well!Beware all ye religious: Dawkins pulls no punches in asserting that most religion is unsubstantiated myth, and his tone (in writing this book for young people) will strike you as especially condescending. I enjoyed the work for the way Dawkins makes his point across such wide-ranging areas of science. Reality really is magical! I also learned: mules are sterile, rainbows are cool, and Newton + prisms put us all to shame. (Is there still something left to discover with a prism?)

In many cases this question of existence can be answered easy by recourse to our five senses. Our ability to see, smell, touch, taste and hear provides us with effective means of establishing this reality. However, the question really is: if our senses cannot detect something directly, then how do we know if it’s real? Lots of things can be seen to fall within this puzzle, for example galaxies that are too far away to see, radio waves that cannot be detected by either our eyes or our ears, and even dinosaurs since they are no longer around to be detected by anything. The answer seems to be that we know all of these things exist due to various methods of often complex investigation, investigation that can ultimately be labelled as science.Of course, scientific investigation isn’t the only means of explaining the existence of things and so, before science stepped in with an answer, magic was often credited as being involved. The ancient Egyptians for example explained the existence of night by suggesting that the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. Likewise, the Japanese used to explain earthquakes as being caused when the giant catfish that carried the world on its back flipped its tail. These are clearly extraordinary, magical explanations. However, it could be said that a different kind of magic exists in the discovery of the real answers to question of why things happen. With The Magic of Reality Dawkins therefore seeks to demonstrate that the real would, as it can be understood scientifically, has a magic all of its own.In The Magic of Reality each chapter is dedicated to one particular aspect of reality – whether it be the sun or earthquakes or rainbows or the many species of animals that exists – and investigates how and why that particular thing has come to be. In the chapter concerning “Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?” for example, Dawkins examines the two great rhythms that dominate our lives. He begins with a couple of Aboriginal myths about the day-night cycle as well as the myth of Persephone, before detailing how the seasonal rhythm is explained by the yearly orbiting of the Earth around the sun at a distance of 93 million miles while the daily rhythm is explained by the Earth’s spinning round and round like a top.The Magic of Reality is an immensely interesting book. Richard Dawkins has taken a host of complex and vital topics and has explained them in a clear, concise manner that would suit both the layman and those with some scientific knowledge. Dawkins provides inspiring explanations of space, time, evolution and other matters within the realm of thought experiments and so uses The Magic of Reality to explain an amazingly wide range of natural phenomena. The breadth of topics covered is immense yet Dawkins’ clear explanative style ensures that all information is presented in an accurate and detailed yet straightforward manner that makes it a pleasure rather than a chore to read.One potential disappointment with this particular edition of The Magic of Reality is that it is a special text-only edition. The original hardback edition contained delightful and illuminating colour illustrations from Dave McKean [yes, of Hellblazer and Sandman fame]. The quality of the illustrations resulted in the hardback of The Magic of Reality being a truly beautiful as well as informative volume. It is intended to be a book that explains science in a clear and exuberant fashion that appeals to readers of all ages and the inclusion of the illustrations would have served to broaden its appeal, particularly to young readers. There is another, more expensive, paperback edition due out later this year and it seems likely that that one will be illustrated, so it’s worth considering which edition would be most suited to your particular interests.Despite having lamented the absence of illustrations, the strength of the text of The Magic of Reality must be reiterated. It is a real page-turner of a science book that grips the reader’s imagination from the very beginning and never fails to both enlighten and astonish. The Magic of Reality is an accessible guide to nearly all of the important questions about the nature of life and the universe."

The truth is more magical-in the best and most exciting sense of the word-than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.We may care about fairness and unfairness, but coins don't give a toss! Nor does the universe at large. Bad things happen because things happen. Whether they are bad or good from our point of view doesn't influence how likely it is that they will happen. Some people find it hard to accept this. They'd prefer to think that sinners get their comeuppance, that virtue is rewarded. Unfortunately the universe doesn't care what people prefer.Scientists don't stop at proposing a model: they then go on to test it. They say, 'If this model that I am imagining were true, we would expect to see such-and-such in the real world'. They predict what you""ll find if you do a particular experiment and make certain measurements. A successful model is one whose predictions come out right, especially if they survive the test of experiment. And if the predictions come out right, we hope it means that the model probably represents the truth, or at least a part of the truth.If these'holy books' really were written, or dictated, or inspired, by all-knowing gods, don't you think its odd that these gods said nothing about any of these important and useful things?Is there really life on other planets ? Nobody knows. If you forced me to give an opinion one way or the other, I'd say yes, and probably on millions of planets. But who cares about an opinion ? There is no direct evidence. One of the great virtues of science is that scientists know when they don't know the answer to something. They cheerfully admit that they don't know. Cheerfully, because not knowing the answer is an exciting challenge to try to find it. There is much that remains deeply mysterious, and it is not likely that we will ever uncover all the secrets of a universe as vast as ours: but, armed with science, we can at least ask sensible, meaningful questions about it and recognize credible answers when we find them. We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories : we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy.Don't ever be lazy enough-defeatist enough, cowardly enough-to say 'It must be supernatural'or 'It must be a miracle'. Say instead that it's a puzzle, it's strange, it's a challenge that we should rise to. Whether we rise to the challenge by questioning the truth of the observation, or by expanding our science in new and exciting directions, the proper and brave response to any such challenge is to tackle it head-on. And until we have found a proper answer to the mystery, it's perfectly OK simply to say, ""This is something we don't yet understand, but we're working on it'. Indeed it is the only honest thing to do."

Apparently it's meant for children/young adults? And apparently it's supposed to be illustrated?? Heads up - the paperback is not at all illustrated besides the small images at the start of each chapter. I really have no idea why you would even publish this book without the illustrations if it's meant to be a children/young adults' science book.I started out thinking that excerpts from this book would have been great required reading for a middle school/early high school science class (with the addition of illustrations, of course, to help drive the understanding home), but I quickly realized that that Dawkins's tone is just too condescending and rude for me to want to force that on anyone. Listen, I'm kind of on his side here, where I think understanding science is more ""magical"" than any religious explanation for things, but man, why you gotta be a jerk about it? I found a lot of his explanations lacking - though mainly that was due to the lack of illustrations in my copy. I was entirely dissatisfied with his explanation of sleep paralysis - don't be all, ""Alien abductions and other horror stories are from sleep paralysis, where people throughout the ages have all hallucinated the same thing"" without addressing the fact that it's HELLA WEIRD WE ALL HALLUCINATE THE SAME THING. Sleep paralysis is one of the few things that gets me borderline believing in something ""supernatural"" because it's so freaking weird, and after forcing my way through this book and finally getting excited about actually learning something, I was let down pretty bad by his explanation or lack thereof.I also felt the structure of the book didn't hold up: the basic structure is ""Here's a religious belief/myth, here's the truth behind it"", but several times the chapter starts with ""Well, I couldn't find any myths about this, but let me explain it anyway."" Like...why? That's not the point of the book? Do you just want to explain something to hear yourself talk (er...write?)?I feel bad kind of bad because I ultimately agree with the premise of this book, but it was poorly executed, in my opinion. Maybe as a young preteen just discovering atheism, this would be more exciting. But for me, I thoroughly hated reading it."
591,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."

Ego still flares and I bristle. It’s annoying being talked to in this way. Does anyone enjoy the tone of this book? Could we not just agree that the human brain is at face value a beautiful thing? Dismissing the intelligence of your reader is tantamount to reducing their intelligence by refusing to give them opportunity to be intelligent. This book is full of weird sentences, statements that are tantamount to insulting your intelligence, etc. “They depend for their existence on” * “It May not be that all of these people are charlatans, it may be that some of them really believe they are talking to the dead” “Gene pools are not liquid. So what are they?” Really??? “Tectonic plates are not like the kind you eat off”. This book must be geared towards a 10 year old? There’s nothing in this you wouldn’t know if you had graduated high school. Nothing goes beyond basic science. Everything is glib. Everything leaves important details out. It’s difficult to respect this in any sense at all for an adult audience. However, I could see it being an excellent resource for children, it’s fast, poppy, fun, and over simplified to the point where you might have to add some additional information, but only for an interested reader or listener.

The author found a fascinating way to guide us through the origin of the universe, it's expansion and how all the natural phenomenons are occurring around us. In short, he tried to enrich and enhance our perception of reality by making us understand the underlying mechanism, and considering the general base of readers, he should be successful. To gain a simplistic yet firm understanding of our perceived reality, how it has affected our culturally diverse mindset throughout time, this book is a gem. But what amazes me most is that this book instills a sense of gratitude. It reminds us how insignificant we are in this universe yet how lucky we are to be a part of this majestic existence."

It certainly is not really for those with a background in science or engineering. Ironically, those are the type of folks who would be most interested in reading a book by Dawkins... and they are quite likely to already be well-versed in the basic biology/geology/astronomy that Dawkins presents. The myths are kind of fun, but I'm not convinced they added much. One thing I do enjoy about reading Dawkins is that he does come up with different sorts of metaphors/analogies to explain concepts than are generally presented in classroom/textbook settings and often re-words and re-reasons things in a way that can help me understand them more fully. Alas, this book did not contain much material of that nature."

This does not mean that an adult will find the book boring. On the contrary, the clear and concise writing makes it a refreshing read.The book essentially is a set of twelve questions and their scientific answers. Dawkins begins the answer to every question by describing the ancient myths (which are very funny BTW) that were made up in an attempt to answer the questions. He then goes on and explains the actual answer as given by science. Essentially, he goes on to show that the scientific truths, once understood, are more magical than any supernatural answer."

The purpose of myths is talking in a metaphorical and poetic way. Trying 'understand' reality by being very literally saying that myths are wrong or reality or saying that you have the ultimate truth thanks to science is being completely unscientific and arrogant. Real scientific people are as curious, religious and love metaphors because life and the world Can't really be explained.Coming from the engineering world I still learned a few things about optics and science, not more than that."

Also a catalogue of non-scientific myths and their scientific counterparts. Great for highschoolers looking to familiarise themselves with basic concepts; if you're one, go for it!The comparison between modes of explaining (naive/folk vs science) lacks depth (Dawkins merely notes that it is interesting how easily the former prevail); I was also hoping to hear Dawkins's own experiences in transcendental/exhilarating thoughts arising from nonmagical thinking (Dawkins does praise the mind-expansion of discovering the electromagnetic spectrum.)"

But it tried to create ways to think about it
599,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17746529-mehedi-sarwar,5,"Nicely written book with several examples. It describes well how the myths are created through different cultures and scriptures when mankind was more busy with survival than scientific exploration of any kind. Many myths would not have created if proper science was already there. Most of the supernatural phenomena we hear about, we hear from our parents, they heard from their parents and so on. Science has already disproved many of them. One of the good takeaway from this book is, if something cannot be explained we do not have to assume that it happened super-naturally or by command of some God, rather we should tell to ourselves that we do know the answer yet, that is the answer is ""X"" , the big unknown. Actually, ""X"" the Unknown should be the default answer to any question until we know the answer. The audio book narration was great. "
600,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4101408-jigme-datse,2,"Richard Dawkins does not seem to understand science. He strongly believes that science will prove everything. Well, science is not really about proving anything in our normal understanding of the term. It is about creating ideas which are not disproven, and the whole point of science is to find disproofs of all the existing understanding of science. Further, he really believes that science has to do with disproving ""myths"" such as creation myths. He fails to believe that these myths might be metaphorical, ""best explanations"" that people can come up with, and he uses really bizarre metaphorical language to explain science himself, which is very much worse in my mind than that was in my mind. But, he *does* write well. He is good at telling a story which is easy to get engaged in. So, this aspect managed to get me through this book..."

I will be requesting a copy for my 9th grade classroom. Kids are naturally curious and fascinated by how the world works. They're also susceptible to all kinds of nonsense, of course. This much-needed book fill s a gap between simplistic kids' books and adult science books. I like how he started each chapter focusing on a myth that in the past served as an explanation for a natural phenomenon. The not so good: His tone fluctuated so often that in some parts of the book he could have been explaining something to a 10 year old, in other parts he could easily have been speaking to a senior in high school. No consistency. This book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters."

For me, this leaves out the spiritual side of life, and those things we cannot yet, or perhaps ever will explain, and it takes the fun out of the read, and of life.No one, not even he, will find all the answers, and while he does acknowledge what he doesn't know at times, he also doesn't leave his door open to explanations other than scientific, which I am sympathetic to.I think I've learned all I can from him for now.(p.s.- I think HE should read the Biology of Belief and let his own thinking continue to grow up alongside it)"

O well!Beware all ye religious: Dawkins pulls no punches in asserting that most religion is unsubstantiated myth, and his tone (in writing this book for young people) will strike you as especially condescending. I enjoyed the work for the way Dawkins makes his point across such wide-ranging areas of science. Reality really is magical! I also learned: mules are sterile, rainbows are cool, and Newton + prisms put us all to shame. (Is there still something left to discover with a prism?)

And if the predictions come out right, we hope it means that the model probably represents the truth, or at least a part of the truth.If these'holy books' really were written, or dictated, or inspired, by all-knowing gods, don't you think its odd that these gods said nothing about any of these important and useful things?Is there really life on other planets ? Nobody knows. If you forced me to give an opinion one way or the other, I'd say yes, and probably on millions of planets. But who cares about an opinion ? There is no direct evidence. One of the great virtues of science is that scientists know when they don't know the answer to something. They cheerfully admit that they don't know. Cheerfully, because not knowing the answer is an exciting challenge to try to find it. There is much that remains deeply mysterious, and it is not likely that we will ever uncover all the secrets of a universe as vast as ours: but, armed with science, we can at least ask sensible, meaningful questions about it and recognize credible answers when we find them. We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories : we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy.Don't ever be lazy enough-defeatist enough, cowardly enough-to say 'It must be supernatural'or 'It must be a miracle'. Say instead that it's a puzzle, it's strange, it's a challenge that we should rise to. Whether we rise to the challenge by questioning the truth of the observation, or by expanding our science in new and exciting directions, the proper and brave response to any such challenge is to tackle it head-on. And until we have found a proper answer to the mystery, it's perfectly OK simply to say, ""This is something we don't yet understand, but we're working on it'. Indeed it is the only honest thing to do."

Apparently it's meant for children/young adults? And apparently it's supposed to be illustrated?? Heads up - the paperback is not at all illustrated besides the small images at the start of each chapter. I really have no idea why you would even publish this book without the illustrations if it's meant to be a children/young adults' science book.I started out thinking that excerpts from this book would have been great required reading for a middle school/early high school science class (with the addition of illustrations, of course, to help drive the understanding home), but I quickly realized that that Dawkins's tone is just too condescending and rude for me to want to force that on anyone. Listen, I'm kind of on his side here, where I think understanding science is more ""magical"" than any religious explanation for things, but man, why you gotta be a jerk about it? I found a lot of his explanations lacking - though mainly that was due to the lack of illustrations in my copy. I was entirely dissatisfied with his explanation of sleep paralysis - don't be all, ""Alien abductions and other horror stories are from sleep paralysis, where people throughout the ages have all hallucinated the same thing"" without addressing the fact that it's HELLA WEIRD WE ALL HALLUCINATE THE SAME THING. Sleep paralysis is one of the few things that gets me borderline believing in something ""supernatural"" because it's so freaking weird, and after forcing my way through this book and finally getting excited about actually learning something, I was let down pretty bad by his explanation or lack thereof.I also felt the structure of the book didn't hold up: the basic structure is ""Here's a religious belief/myth, here's the truth behind it"", but several times the chapter starts with ""Well, I couldn't find any myths about this, but let me explain it anyway."" Like...why? That's not the point of the book? Do you just want to explain something to hear yourself talk (er...write?)?I feel bad kind of bad because I ultimately agree with the premise of this book, but it was poorly executed, in my opinion. Maybe as a young preteen just discovering atheism, this would be more exciting. But for me, I thoroughly hated reading it."
621,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."

Ego still flares and I bristle. It’s annoying being talked to in this way. Does anyone enjoy the tone of this book? Could we not just agree that the human brain is at face value a beautiful thing? Dismissing the intelligence of your reader is tantamount to reducing their intelligence by refusing to give them opportunity to be intelligent. This book is full of weird sentences, statements that are tantamount to insulting your intelligence, etc. “They depend for their existence on” * “It May not be that all of these people are charlatans, it may be that some of them really believe they are talking to the dead” “Gene pools are not liquid. So what are they?” Really??? “Tectonic plates are not like the kind you eat off”. This book must be geared towards a 10 year old? There’s nothing in this you wouldn’t know if you had graduated high school. Nothing goes beyond basic science. Everything is glib. Everything leaves important details out. It’s difficult to respect this in any sense at all for an adult audience. However, I could see it being an excellent resource for children, it’s fast, poppy, fun, and over simplified to the point where you might have to add some additional information, but only for an interested reader or listener.

The author found a fascinating way to guide us through the origin of the universe, it's expansion and how all the natural phenomenons are occurring around us. In short, he tried to enrich and enhance our perception of reality by making us understand the underlying mechanism, and considering the general base of readers, he should be successful. To gain a simplistic yet firm understanding of our perceived reality, how it has affected our culturally diverse mindset throughout time, this book is a gem. But what amazes me most is that this book instills a sense of gratitude. It reminds us how insignificant we are in this universe yet how lucky we are to be a part of this majestic existence."

It certainly is not really for those with a background in science or engineering. Ironically, those are the type of folks who would be most interested in reading a book by Dawkins... and they are quite likely to already be well-versed in the basic biology/geology/astronomy that Dawkins presents. The myths are kind of fun, but I'm not convinced they added much. One thing I do enjoy about reading Dawkins is that he does come up with different sorts of metaphors/analogies to explain concepts than are generally presented in classroom/textbook settings and often re-words and re-reasons things in a way that can help me understand them more fully. Alas, this book did not contain much material of that nature."

This does not mean that an adult will find the book boring. On the contrary, the clear and concise writing makes it a refreshing read.The book essentially is a set of twelve questions and their scientific answers. Dawkins begins the answer to every question by describing the ancient myths (which are very funny BTW) that were made up in an attempt to answer the questions. He then goes on and explains the actual answer as given by science. Essentially, he goes on to show that the scientific truths, once understood, are more magical than any supernatural answer."

The purpose of myths is talking in a metaphorical and poetic way. Trying 'understand' reality by being very literally saying that myths are wrong or reality or saying that you have the ultimate truth thanks to science is being completely unscientific and arrogant. Real scientific people are as curious, religious and love metaphors because life and the world Can't really be explained.Coming from the engineering world I still learned a few things about optics and science, not more than that."

It describes well how the myths are created through different cultures and scriptures when mankind was more busy with survival than scientific exploration of any kind. Many myths would not have created if proper science was already there. Most of the supernatural phenomena we hear about, we hear from our parents, they heard from their parents and so on. Science has already disproved many of them. One of the good takeaway from this book is, if something cannot be explained we do not have to assume that it happened super-naturally or by command of some God, rather we should tell to ourselves that we do know the answer yet, that is the answer is ""X"" , the big unknown. Actually, ""X"" the Unknown should be the default answer to any question until we know the answer. The audio book narration was great. "

641,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10633326-ida,4,"In The magic of reality, Dawkins gives a short introduction to a selection of wide ranging concepts, like evolution and extraterrestrial life. I thought the explanations were very well done. Even though many of the topics touched on comes with an extensive set of alienating terminology, Dawkins generally sticks to straightforward language. Sometimes I felt he tried too hard to pit myhts and superstition against modern science. The sentiment was fine and he was respectful, I just found the angle tireing after a while. It felt a bit out of place considering the demographic.Anyone already interested in science, will probably be familiar with most of the concepts in this book. I think the bigger thing to take away from it is the merits of critical thinking and the beauty of reality in itself. It is more or less a 300 page homage to the scientific method.Dawkins unveils the magic behind mundane phenomena in nature, and makes you wonder how you missed it for so long."

I could see how a 10-12 year old would really like it, and it's a great refresher for adults too. If only I had absorbed as much when I learned this stuff the first time.Perhaps more interesting is Dawkins's use of myths to introduce each chapter and provide a contrast to reality. It's clear that Dawkins, a noted atheist, has a point to make here. It's actually kind of funny/bizarre to read sentences like ""A Jewish legend tells how two cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, were destroyed by the Hebrew god because the people who lived there were so wicked,"" when you grew up hearing these stories told as if they were fact and as if God were ""God"" and not just one of many. I get what he's trying to do, but the approach still left me a bit cold even though I am no longer religious. While its obviously no longer reasonable to believe these myths as literal explanations of the physical world, Dawkins neglects their emotional heft and I found his attitude a bit flip."

Still worth the read if you liked his other books but just not as ground breaking as some of his others books.
647,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7032663-eric-wojciechowski,5,"If you don't know much about the nature of things; such as, that the Earth goes around the sun (an astonishing third of United States populace think the reverse), don't know that the Earth is four-and-a-half-billion-years-old (some still say six-thousand) or that all creatures on Earth are related to a common ancestor rather than poofing into existence, exactly as we are today, then this is the book for you. If you think “luck” has anything to do with outcomes, or if miracles occur, this is an excellent book to start with. Written for novices on such subject matters, and young adults, Richard Dawkins takes the sum of much of his other work (and that of others) and dials it down to fit a wider audience. This is an excellent and accessible collection of answers to origins, what things are made of (atoms), why do Earthquakes happen, what is the sun, etc. And while I consider myself to be knowledgeable in these areas (enough to get by, anyhow), I considered this work a nice refresher and worth the read.What I like about Mr. Dawkins is his ability to communicate these subjects on par with Carl Sagan. A scientist who can remove the equations and give us the facts, complete with examples and models (while the equations are there for further study if you wish). Mr. Dawkins also writes like he speaks. I'm rather certain he follows the writing rule to read out loud what you write. Does it sound good? If not, then re-write it. I can hear his voice as I'm reading this work, complete with British accent. What I enjoyed most was the subject of who was the first person. Probably because my five-year-old-daughter has been asking this one. The thought experiment given by Mr. Dawkins of taking a picture of yourself, then laying your father's picture on top, then grandfather, then great-grandfather and so on, (having to eventually imagine pictures of great-great-greats for lack of photos), the line up of photographs would be forty-miles long and total 185 million greats (or grancestors) to get back to when your ancestor was something of a fish. You could walk along this forty-mile length of pictures, pulling out groups here and there and see that pictures near each other would look alike, but pictures, say at the five-mile mark would be a completely different species than at the fifteen-mile mark. There was no first person. Little changes grow to big changes but lots of time is needed. It's the nature of the beast, if you will.And to understand this concept further, Mr. Dawkins shows us how language changes. Groups of people wander away from each other, both with the same language and dialect. But over time, words are added, dropped, changed in both groups. If enough time goes by, if the two should meet again, they wouldn't understand each other. Or maybe they would but it would be difficult. I'm personally thinking of how hard a time I have reading Shakespeare. Surely it's English but an English I'm not familiar with.In the age of Wikipedia, answers can be obtained quickly. So if you come away from this work wanting to know more, it's readily accessible. If you're new to these subjects or like a quick refresher on them, I recommend the Magic of Reality. Especially if you have young kids who need the answers, who ask these questions about firsts. Because that's when humans ask the most of them and, in my opinion, need correct answers. Because fixing bad answers is harder the longer a child retains them."

649,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3134966-sasha-martinez,0,"Had been reading this on and off, mostly in bursts, really; the book, though fun, tends to be a mind-numbing cascade of information. Sanity must be preserved: The book breaks down complex scientific truths more manageably, but, you know, brain hurt happens.The book’s written for a younger crowd, and I believe Dawkins wanted this to stand alongside [if not in place of] storybooks on myth-making heroes and fairytales. And, sure, bibles and their parables. But the grumpy atheist we’ve come to know in Dawkins is muted. He’s just this midly-peeved, impatient, and ultimately dismissive aura hovering over all the science-yum. (I’ve noticed, though, an awkwardness to the voice—but perhaps I’ve read him when he’s let loose, when he doesn’t need to temper?)The focus is on Science and its many wonders, even though, yes, the argument for each chapter is grounded on dismantling myth and religion. [No, silly, some blonde sun-god does not pull a chariot across the sky—the earth revolves on its axis!] Myth, Dawkins keeps repeating, came to be in the days of yore because of an ignorance not through our own fault. We weren’t capable then of the best answers to our questions, not yet. But to continue believing in these myths [i.e., religion]—to accept them as fact, despite the evidence that science offers—despite science assiduously, even gleefully, searching for the answers—just makes one a dodo. (That’s the Dawkins I know.)Dawkins wants me to raise a skeptical child—yes, I’d like to keep this in my shelves, within easy reach of some little monster, eventually. A child who believes in fact, embraces speculations, but relies on logic, evidence, and common sense—without sacrificing an imagination that’s the very foundation of these vast myths he’s dismissively disassembled. A child who’d rather lose himself in the wonder of reality, one ceaselessly amazing because it what is true. (It’s why I like science so much: It assuages your curiosity, and it keeps reminding you how everything makes sense, because the world has rules—serendipity that abounds, the awe-inspiring logic of different grades of intricacy.)Well, at least I hope that’s what he wants. Either way, that’s what I plan to do to little creatures—the gods be willing, and all that jazz. In the meantime, I’m happy to do that myself. [ETA: I admit to rethinking this read-to-a-young’un thing. See, when I was a child, I read this kid's encyclopedia that talked about how the sun would burn itself up, how all life would suffer as a consequence, how everything would subsequently perish. ""In a billion years"" was not a consolation. I carried that knowledge inside me for so long, and I couldn't tell anyone because they were supposed to already know.]A tip: If you’re going to get one for keeps, do find the hardcover copy I have, the one that’s sure to have Dave McKean’s breathtakingly clever illustrations in color. This would have been less of a fun book if it weren’t for the art. Dave McKean, and a science delivered—argued—by Dawkins? Delicious. Just brain-hurty deliciousness."
650,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8795422-william,4,Richard Dawkins is an accomplished scientist with many esteemed publications. He is also a well known apologist for the atheist community. What he has attempted in this book is the debunking of religious explanations for natural phenomenon and the promotion of scientific solutions to those same mysteries. He did an admiral job covering his topic but I must admit I did not feel any magic. He would alternate between a religious or mythological explanation of the big questions of existence then offer sciences take on the subject. In terms of the science he has essentially presented us with an elementary science textbook which covers a wide array of subjects while steering away from the more complicated topics. He makes the mistake of chiding the religious fundamentalist for their views on the sanctity of their beliefs when he doesn't need to. I feel they will fall apart of their own accord. I recommend this book simply because it is written in Dawkins clear and engaging prose. I don't think it will draw too many fundamentalistsu away from the comfort of their beliefs but it does carry on with the triumph of the age of reason.
651,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,3,"Oh, how my 12-year-old self would have been delighted to have this little gem of a science book in her bookcase! With  The Magic of Reality, biologist and writer Richard Dawkins explores the scientific method, the difference between reality and magic, and looks for the answers to some of life’s most imminent questions (“Who was the first person?”, “What are things made of?”, “When and how did everything begin?”, etc.).Each chapter starts off with a main question that needs answering, followed by a mythical story used to explain said question in older times, and then followed up with the actual scientific answer. The tone is light and easy to understand, and it’s a perfect book for curious kids who want to know how the world/the universe works but aren’t ready for adult science books yet. As such, it doesn’t go too deep into scientific theory – not a problem in my opinion, since it’s more than enough for kids and will get that wow-teach-me-more-about-science!-spark burning anyway.Next to finding the scientific answers to a couple of very interesting questions, one of Dawkins’ main points is to distinguish between myth, magic, and make-believe, and the actual reality that can be mapped through scientific experiments. He emphasises critical and sceptical thinking, showing how the scientific method is a much better way of approaching and solving problems than just making up stories about some gods up in the sky. And as always, he also notes that reality itself, uncovered through and by science, is already magical and fantastical enough in and of itself – we don’t even need those mythological stories. Hence, the title.As of now, I doubt anybody is unaware of Dawkins’ stance on religion, and though his dislike of it does seep through a little (foolish humans always using silly stories to explain naturally occurring phenomena when they could be using science!), it isn’t as obvious as usual. Probably because the group this book is aimed towards is a little younger than Dawkins’ standard audience. Anyhow, it didn’t bother me nor did I feel he was making fun of myths in general – all he seemed to be saying was that they provide an outdated view.I’m all for making kids enthusiastic about science, and this book definitely does that. As an adult, it was an enjoyable read for me as well – the light tone and passion of it shine through."

The edition I read was a small mass-market paperback, and Dave McKean's doubtlessly beautiful artwork was reduced to smudged greyscale thumbnails that would not have done justice to Martínez's Ecce Homo. It is the only major flaw I can find in the book.The Magic of Reality is written for a pre-teen audience, which is reflected in the language. However, the simple, handholding approach works for an older reader as well, especially in the case of some of the more complex concepts.Here, Dawkins walks the reader through such myriad basic science topics as evolution, genetics, the change of seasons and motion of the planets. Most of the content was already familiar to me, but I am not a scientist, so even there my understanding was deepened. To me, the big thing in the book was the explanation of the function of the spectroscope, redshifting and how the date of the Big Bang was arrived to. Fascinating stuff.Dawkins also displays humility in the occasional admission that this or that thing is outside of his area of expertise and even he does not understand it. Quantum physics springs to mind. However, he commits a significant linguistic gaffe by listing the languages of Romansch, Galician, Occitan and Catalan as dialects, which is linguistically suspect and comes with enough political baggage to choke a horse. Hell, Romansch is an official language in Switzerland, fulfilling even the armey un flot definition. Not much of a flot, admittedly, but it exists.Each chapter of the book opens with a series of mythical tales from around the world, illustrating the history of attempts to explain where we come from, where we're going, or what's that big shiny thing up there in the sky. These are occasionally interesting, but by and large, it is my feeling that Dawkins is at his best when he stays out of the humanities and in the hard sciences, where his expertise lies.All told, The Magic of Reality is a quick, entertaining and educational read. Just get the full-colour edition, because doing this to Dave McKean is a crime against art."
653,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This is one of the few books that I would consider comparing to Asimov's writing, particularly for youth. He explains clearly many things about science. This is NOT a book to read if you are religious or believe in astrology, etc! He completely dismisses religion's ability to actually explain things today. I especially liked one of the final chapters dealing with luck. He explains what the law of averages really mean, and why it is silly to assume someone is a lucky or unlucky person or due to have some good luck after a lot of bad luck. He also talks about the impossibility of miracles using a famous one as example. Did I mention you won't like this book if you are religious? He covers a LOT of basic science. In fact I was thinking that the book could easily be used by a middle grade science teacher as one of the textbooks. Probably not the only textbook since by the general nature of covering quite a few different branches of science, a lot of it is not in depth science. He also gives you a way of evaluating whether something is believable, which would be useful for many of us. He is passionate that not only is science the proper way to view the world, it is also the most beautiful, magical way to view the world. He uses the definition of magic as poetic in the title. If you have youngsters, particularly if you live in a conservative, religious area that is limiting what science can be taught, this book is a must to buy, read and discuss with those youngsters! It may also have the effect of helping kids to realize how fascinating science is and consider taking it up as a career!"
654,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12809503-david-powell,5,"Having read some of the other reviews, I think that some people have the wrong perception of this excellent book. I am not sure that some of the reviewers even got the point of the book. It is not an introduction to science for children no matter how it was advertised. While is is true that the book seems somewhat condescending at times to anyone with some knowledge of science, it is a delineation between what is mythology and what is science (or fact). If one thinks about it, religion happens to be the particular mythology that any given person believes in. For this reason, the crushing challenge that Dawkins brings against religion's explanations for why things are is likely to step upon people's spiritual toes. Every mythology has its roots, in my opinion, in primitive people's need to know about first cause, natural events, and life and death. A simple exercise in imagination can see some primitive people approaching a tribal chief or witchdoctor with exactly those questions, and to extend the image further, the chief or witchdoctor, to maintain his credibility, has to quickly come up with clever, engaging explanations for why we die or why the sun comes up in the morning. My guess it that every mythology began this way. I would bet that Dawkins would agree. You will be, to be sure, reschooled in science, but you will be given a chance to see how silly primitive myths are in today's world. (I read the paperback version which apparently lacks much of the illustration that was discussed in earlier reviews of the hardback version.)"
655,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5923392-diana,5,"Might be my favorite Dawkins book so far. It's certainly the only one I finished in under 24 hrs.I absolutely adored the last 2 chapters about probability and miracles. I laughed out loud in a public place when I got to the lone Scotsman practicing the bagpipes. I have previously read The God Delusion, The Selfish Gene, The Ancestor's Tale, and The Blind Watchmaker, and they had left me thinking that Dawkins' strengths lie in explaining biology and debating political/sociological issues, but that his divergence towards physics or related fields were not as successful. While his biology for example left me fascinated, his explanations of physics concepts are usually understandable but very barren. In this book, however, Dawkins' talks of the prism and the spectroscope for example were simply mesmerizing. Maybe it's because his target audience was younger people so he had to change his tone from explaining-how-things-work to explaining-why-things-are-awesome and you could feel his excitement for these concepts just like his passion for biology is always palpable.Another lovely thing about this book is Dawkins' treatment of the myth sections. While he usually treats mythology and religion as the unfortunate but inevitable product of evolution and sociology, in his book here, he approached them from an anthropological point of view. While maintaining that they are categorically false and poor explanations for reality, he did give them some respect as nice pieces of culture, literature and history."
656,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30594288-arunbalaji-mohanraj,5,"A wonderful book by Richard Dawkins to explain what is the real science behind everything that we believe as magic. This book is all about the myth that we heard from our childhood in different terms and the real science or reasons behind it. I really liked the chapters where he discussed about who was the first person, what are things made of, what is the sun, rainbow and an earthquake. After reading this book, I got questions within myself about our universe and also understood many facts about our universe especially earth and stars from the other sources. I was really shocked to know that it would take thousands of years to reach our nearest star other than the sun. The evolutionary science explained in this book was quite interesting and he takes us through the biological science as the author is an evolutionary biologist on the chapters related to the first person. Also he well illustrated about the existence of life in other planets in the chapter - ""Are we alone."" Author explained each and every chapters with the myths as well as the science and I really enjoyed the science that came after each and every myths. At the beginning of the book, I felt it as quite boring however after few chapters the book was really interesting and I feel like I should read it once again. I would recommend this book for everyone as there are many interesting facts about our universe that we should know for sure."
657,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40677420-hugh-dunnett,4,"An excellent young adult/introductory guide to major themes in science. Dawkins is a superb writer with a talent for describing scientific topics in a way to make them enjoyable and quite comprehensible to all. The areas of science covered are fairly broad in range but specific enough to allow a genuine developing of understanding. Further to this, Dave McKean’s illustrations are frequently breath-taking and genuinely illuminating. This is as much McKean’s book as it is Dawkins’.The novel idea in this introduction to science is to touch on ancient myths and then to speak of the science, the reality behind the myth. This could have added something of a nuanced and unusual flavour to the book. However I felt that the often rather shoehorned inclusion at the start of most chapters of ancient beliefs and myths, often obscure to the point of being well without the everyday readers’ consciousness doesn’t add much to the later revealed ‘magic’ of the scientific reality. Indeed, the only reason I can see for their inclusion is to build up to the final two chapters which have little to do with scientific method but appear to be included primarily to provide a platform to bash believer and belief. This Dawkins has done comprehensively in previous works and which wasn’t really required in this publication. It is a shame as the book would have been quite perfect without it."
658,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54322403-abdulrahman-alhamali,3,"The Magic or Reality by Richard Dawkins is a book that aims to explain the astonishing world around us through the lens of science. It presents several natural phenomena, and compares their scientific and mythical explanations. I enjoyed the book, and learned a lot of interesting facts, especially about biology, the specialty of Dawkins. But I did not enjoy two things: 1- The parts that were not about biology felt very ""reportive"". They just felt as if someone was telling me a lot of information with minimum explanation. 2- The ""reportive"" style of most of the chapters made the book kind of ironic for me; The book tries very hard to pitch the idea of abandoning religious and mythical explanations, but does that in a very ""religious"" way, where the author just presents facts with minimal explanation, and then says: This is what you should believe, not what you read in the religious books.I believe Dawkins could have done a much better job had he tried to write the book in a format that is more interactive and less reportive, or had he focused more on biology, where he most truly shines."
659,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5038234-dylan-armes,4,"After finishing this book, I told my wife we're finally ready to have kids, now that this book is around.Written at a junior high level, this was Richard Dawkins' attempt to write a book of general science that answers a lot of common questions from kids. Questions like ""How do we know how far away things are in space?"" or ""Where did the dinosaurs go?""Love him or hate him, there's no denying that Professor Dawkins is a master of explaining difficult-to-grasp scientific concepts. Though I felt like I understood everything in the book pretty well before going through it, his explanations were all very easy to understand and well-argued.Each chapter of this book begins with some sort of mythology story, from all over the world. Dawkins focuses on how different peoples and different religions answer questions in various supernatural ways, and how now science can give us the answers that people have been searching for all this time. This book is not an attack on religion, like his most famous work: The God Delusion. Rather, it's like his less famous, but overall much better The Selfish Gene, or The Greatest Show on Earth. I recommend this book to everyone over the age of 10. At the VERY LEAST, it will make you think. And you will likely end up with a deeper understanding of fundamental scientific concepts. "
660,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33410234-dan-croft,3,"This book started out well enough; somewhat like The Universe in a Nutshell or similar books about science. I'd say the subject matter discussed is pretty basic for anyone who has a working knowledge of high school and maybe some college level chemistry, biology, physics, etc. Even so, Dawkins has an entertaining and enjoyable writing style, which make it fun to listen, even if it is review. In the beginning of the book Dawkins seem to have a genuine interest in helping the novice person interested in science (but with no background in it) understand some basic precepts. As the book progresses, particularly in the last two chapters, the purpose of the book appears to shift from science education to debunking the supernatural aspects of religion. Dawkins is a well known and outspoken atheist, so it is certainly understandable why he would want to point out his views. However, towards the end he begins to become repetitive, which really grinds down the reader. His points are valid and well taken, but he fails to give any credit to religion as anything more than mythology that should be interpreted literally. The fact that he fails to acknowledge religion as a more abstract philosophy and code of ethics leads the reader to believe that he, not the reader, is the one missing the point. "
661,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237803-m,4,"As one of the reviews on the cover described it, ""A Perfect Introduction to Science"", which it is indeed. Another well-written book by Richard Dawkins, much lighter and simpler than most of his books, mainly targeting more general readers serving to find the magic in truth rather than myths, and to show how reality can be sometimes more entertaining than fiction. For me, there was little new there but I thoroughly enjoyed the way it was written and the calm and patient approach to explaining scientific concepts. Each chapter discussed a scientific topic or phenomenon, it started with listing some of the legends that tried to explain this subject, then slowly discussing the scientific explanation of the phenomenon focusing on the beauty of the truth and how it can be more magical (not in the supernatural sense of the word) than the myths and fantasies created and passed on over generations.This is an essential read to help increase basic science literacy. The light version of science here might appeal to the general reader who finds it difficult to read a science book. The introduction and final chapter can serve as an eye-opener for some readers, though you would normally think that a Richard Dawkins' reader will normally be already familiar with these ideas."
662,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22748104-josh-taylor,2,"I think the pilgrimage Dawkins is on trying to teaching people the illogicality of their ways and show them there is beauty in science is fine, admirable in a way. But people that do not agree with that line of thought are hardly likely to pick up one of Dawkins books. So why preach to the converted? What I found as a scientist was a book filled with common sense explanation.The illogical beliefs/theory’s that people hold that he disproves through explanation, although well explained are trivial and therefore his explanations come across in my opinion as patronizing to the reader. And I would have thought that to be the case for the majority of people who read this book science layman or not. I am not having a go at Dawkins I just think he is out of touch with the times, the Selfish Gene was revolutionary and shocking at the time of its release due to its controversial contents compared to the widely held believes of the populous at the time. Now I feel like he’s trying to do the same thing. I thought this book would highlight the mind bending and amazing things that are happening in modern science such as quantum entanglement stuff that makes you go WOW. Instead it was just a dig at the minority of people that hold certain beliefs. "
663,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48066-chazzle,4,"I really enjoyed this book about general science, and how we know what we know. Although written at a middle school level, interesting observations abound. For example, suppose you look through a telescope at a star that's 100 million light years away. That means you're looking at something that happened 100 million years ago. As such, if you happened to be observing intelligent life looking at us, they would be seeing dinosaurs, not you, in the present moment! Wild! This is an example of the poetic magic of reality, giving the book's title.I happened upon a youtube video with Bill O'Reilly interviewing author Richard Dawkins, while actually trying to find another link recommended by the author in the book itself. And O'Reilly's point is true, IMHO. Indeed, the author does spend a good portion of time dismantling the miracle stories of various religions, including Christianity, in a book marketed to the young. So, if you're a biblical literalist, or prefer that your child not have the miracle accounts in his scripture debunked, this might not be the book for you. As I see it, though, Dawkins' grip on reality is much, much firmer than O'Reilly's."
664,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1784379-jess-cattanach,4,"The Magic of Reality is the first Dawkins book I’ve read, but I feel like it was a good introduction to his works. Relatively short and easily digestible, this book is perfect for a quick read between tasks. Dawkins addresses a number of things that many people have little scientific understanding about, and introduces each chapter in a very nifty fashion: by describing some of the myths people have come up with over the years to describe the phenomena. After this humorous introduction he goes on to explain what actually occurs in a way that is both scientifically sound and understandable, even for those with no science background.I may be a little biased, being a science student and overall science geek, but I really did enjoy this book. Dawkins’ writing style flows together quite nicely and even if you know how one of the processes work he writes it in a way that makes it still engaging to read.Really, I think the thing that makes this book stand out is its wonderful contrast between myth and reality (hence the title!) It very neatly wraps up, too, that everything has a sound explanation, even if we are yet to find out what that explanation is. "
665,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,3,"Standing on its own, I should give this book 5 stars. It is written for an audience that is not science literate and it not only does the job but it actually very enligtening and gives the reader a sense of joy vis-a-vis astronomy and other forms of science.That said, I rated it 3 starts because I'm comparing it to his other books which were so much better. I'm still not sure how this rating system works but I tend not to rate a book on its own merit but to compare it to other books the same author has written - that is, if I've read other books by the same author. So maybe my ""3"" is not altogether fair.Getting back to the book, this one would be a FANTASTIC book assignment for high school students who are taking science classes and are struggling with the Big Questions like, ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" Why is this or that thing bad luck?"" ... you get the idea. Dawkins turns the reader to science and helps her to understand that there are marvelous and surreal experiences to be had aside from subscribing circumstances to superstition."
666,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310403-kyle,3,"A handbook for junior sceptics and parents not wanting their children growing up deluded about gods, myths or magic, Dawkins covers a lot of ground from earliest traces of life on earth to the reason rainbows appear in the sky, plus how the planets and stars maintain their relative position to our rotating/revolving peppercorn. There are a few fields he dares not enter, such as quarks and other subatomic processes, which he leaves out of the book. Most chapters seem as backwards as the title: in attempting to prove the reality of what others would claim to be magic, he gives a passing description of what scientists have observed that are preceded by the wild and occasionally amusing myths from around the world, all of which are assuredly wrong. Wouldn't more children be interested in being talked up to by learning a scientific concept first, and then finding out the amazing variety of stories different cultures have provided to explain the concept without science but with a more alchemical sense of reality?"
667,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17891225-karnika-kapoor,4,"It was interesting to read about the mythological stories from different cultures and eras. I was rather more impressed by ""The God Delusion"" than by ""The magic of reality"". Perhaps, because it was my first Richard Dawkins's book and I was hugely impressed by the argument made there (as the same was in my subconscious all my life). The debunking of myth in this book is something not very new to me. However, it includes bits and peaces of information that I was not aware of and I profoundly enjoyed gaining information about those bits. I specifically liked the part related to ""sleep paralysis"" as I experience the same quite often. Back in my ""Theistic"" days, I use to relate it with supernatural (Guilty as charged). But as I started to think rationally over things, it was not quite logical to follow. I recommend this book to people seeking an empirical evidence against the so-called ""miracle"" of past. A typical Dawkins style approach to encourage people to think rationally. I enjoyed reading it. "
668,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6137539-david-h,0,"Magic Reality is a very good children's book on general science. It is based strictly on evolution and cosmology. It is Richard Dawkins way of fighting what he called The God Delusion in an earlier book. Once this delusion takes hold of the mind, it cannot be removed. So it must not be allowed in at all. Children must never be taught about God or any supernatural creatures except as myths. A child's view of reality must be the child's first view of reality. Because it is new, it will seem magic. Hence the title, The Magic of Reality. Children are natural-born scientists. Any intelligent observer of children at play will see this. They observe, they wonder, they test, they wonder some more...until some stupid adult pulls them away and fills their little heads with Adam and Eve and the snake and the apple. So Dawkins has written a book as much fun as fairy tales, as exciting as pirate stories, and as full of true spirituality as any of the crap they teach in Sunday School."
669,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5731693-jerry-stroh,4,"This children's book by Richard Dawkins & illustrated by Dave McKean (of Sandman fame) is great and I highly recommend it to anyone, even adults, because there is a lot of info here which even I didn't know about science - and I mean general stuff that in an ideal world, nobody with a public school education shouldn't know - and again, like most of Dawkins' books, it makes science interesting. My favorite part was about rainbows. I think every child around 10 should be given this book to read. Right about the time they learn the truth about Santa Claus. You know, when it's the right time to teach children the difference between fiction and reality. So they understand that rainbows are formed by light reflected through falling rain and were not created by 'God' after the myth of Noah and his crowded ark, for example. And other stuff about the reality of evolution and the fiction of the supernatural."
670,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7664274-sarah,3,"I'm in no way a scientific genius. My brain is ruled by myth and magic more than logic and hard facts. That's not to say that I don't adore learning about the world and learning about the reality of the times in which we live. I suppose that's why I was drawn to this book- 'The Magic of Reality'. What a fantastic title! I was also encouraged by the fact that this book was written 'for people of all generations' and yes, it was easy to understand. Dawkins has a remarkable ability to flawlessly simplify really difficult science. I think there's something very appealing about a scientist who can make physics and chemistry appealing and relateable. My only issue was that, at times, it was patronising and holier than thou. I may not be a religious person, but even then I felt that Dawkins took some cheap shots against religious beliefs. Yes yes, we all get it, science and religion are on opposite wavelengths. You don't need to be a jackass about it. "

Listening to it as an audiobook was particularly effective, I think, because you could hear the joy and excitement in the readers' voices (read partially by Dawkins, partially by a woman). Essentially, this book is a review of high school science, but without the irritations, boredom, and hormones. Dawkins shows a genuine love of science and shares his enthusiasm through well-crafted prose that, thought it dives into challenges topics, never felt stuffy or too challenging. I would recommend this as a fantastic book for anyone interested in how the world works, especially as a primer to reading more in-depth works, such as A Short History of Nearly Everything. Additionally, I would recommend this book to any ""baby"" atheist looking for information about how the world works. "

This book is an example of the great scientific interesting vulgarisation. Starting from ""What is reality?"" till ""What is miracle?"", I couldn't predict what author gonna say before I enter into an actual chapter. I guess, there his brilliance challenging us. Sometimes, I wonder how can he touch so easily those sensitive topics , commenting on it and cleverly driving us to believe in it etc. Magic Vs Reality, Gods,Myth Vs Sceince , DNA Evolution, Dromerdeener, gene pool etc He is answering for all crazy questions in an intelligent funny acceptable way... haha... Simply I love his writing. I enjoyed each and every line of this book.

673,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6874323-thomas-ray,1,"This is not so much a book of science, as an attack on religion. And, it's not an attack on religion as it is, but as the author imagines it to be. In the author's misunderstood view, religion is merely and solely a poor man's science, whose purpose was just to describe the cosmos mythologically, when we didn't know any better--and we should be done with religion by now. To the contrary, religion is about developing spiritual strength, to prepare oneself for the moments of moral crisis in life. Without that strength, we lack the needed grace, fall from the path, and suffer. The author doesn't know this, as he hasn't bothered to find out. Instead, he relies on his preconceived, wrong notions of religion. And writes about religion without understanding what it's about. The author's approach to writing about religion is the reverse of scientific. It's dogmatic."
674,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"A well-written book but too basic and too short. This book is a kind of ""Cliff Notes"" on most elementary, and important, scientific topics like natural evolution, Newtonian/Copernicus astronomy, the nature of atoms etc. There is not much to be learnt for anyone who has gone through the high school science courses without sleeping. The author's objectives are different (or same if you have read him before): to debunk the non-scientific, particularly religious notions of how we came in to being. So while the book brings little that would be new to seasoned readers (of almost any kind), the way the book is put together makes it an easy read with many interesting myths, anecdotes and language twists to describe some scientific concepts. The book is more useful for teens and/or people at impressionable ages."

Another reason I liked it tremendously is that I had my first audio book experience with it; where Dawkins reads through all the chapters with his wife. Although some information presented was basic and sometimes critical of beliefs and religious thoughts, the way it was illustrated was fascinating as each chapter starts with a myth and then is explained scientifically. Questions like ""What is an earthquake?"" and "" What is the sun?"" are answered. This book is quite suitable for all ages, and it really evokes wonderment in you. I particularly loved how he explained magic in the first chapter, and how the most beauty lies in the poetic-and real sense of the world. It is true, the magic of unraveling a mystery and the road to discovery is indeed, beautiful."

I’ve chosen this book because my friend told me to read it. There are 12 chapters in it, each chapter has real question like what is rainbow? What’s the sun? Etc. Moreover, Richard answers to those questions logically and realistic it’s kind of magic if you imagine and think about it. I really enjoy reading it and the best part was in the first chapter, its talk about biology and I really love anything about biology. Also the writer talks about the scientist. Richard impressed me so I did a search for him and I found that he’s an English ethnologist and evolutionary biologist. "

According to Richard Dawkins, there are three different types of magic - supernatural magic, stage magic, and poetic magic. Supernatural magic is something not scientifically possible, something that only happens in fairytales. Stage magic is an illusion to make you think what you’re seeing is magic, but it’s really all just a complex trick.The book ends with ‘What is a miracle?’, in which Dawkins talks about how to decide what a miracle is. Decide the possible explanations and select the most likely. It’s probably just a coincidence. Some coincidences can become what seems a miracle by exaggerated re-tellings.I thought this book was okay. It was written well, and a few of the things I was interested in, but as far non-fiction books go, it was good!"

Enlightening new knowledge that gives one a new vision of nature.MEDIUM At the cover of this book’s edition there’s a short summary by Ricky Gervais which says essentially that this book makes you smarter. I could not agree more. Reading this book will most likely fill some knowledge gap for you that you weren’t aware of. It sure did for me. Chapters often start with old - and not so old - myths and religious stories regarding topics of reality life. These stories are then contrasted with science’s explanations to the same phenomena. Such a structure displays the superior strength of science over non-evidence based beliefs. Dawkins guides us delightfully through the realms of biology, astronomy, physics, ethics, and many more. Without a doubt this book will enlighten you in some way or another, it will make you wonder and observe things in nature differently. I profoundly enjoyed the trip.LONGESTImagine you are assigned with the task of explaining to your young teenager cousin the origin of biology as we know and live it. You will have to mention how diverse life on Earth is, even beyond science’s reach. And how it’s organized - sometimes fuzzily - in different kingdoms: plants, animals, microscopic life… How can one tackle such an assignment?One reasonable option is to opt for a reductionist - macro to micro - approach. We start off with a complex being such as an elephant, then “simplify” down to a fly that probably flies around it. From here we can focus on the uni-neuronal worm crawling around the same scene, then the grass our elephant is stepping on until the point we include a simple bacteria floating in the pond on the ground. You know these beings - and all the rest on the planet including us humans - are all related, part of their DNA is shared. They all derive from the same ancestor - millions of years ago. But how can you explain their relationship? One word: evolution. Evolution must certainly be part of your explanation then, it links all these seemingly unrelated beings together.You may be asked this question, understandably: how can we know what happened millions of years ago? The answer is that scientists infer it from fossils and geological layers. Fossils are preserved instances of past living creatures that often no longer exist at the same evolutionary step. So they don’t exist but yet they are real? Precisely, reality is not just what we see or know, it’s also what used to exist in one shape or another. How can we understand things that don’t exist and don’t have access to? By using models. Building models allows scientists to fill the gaps missing in the knowledge puzzle. As new evidence appears those models are refined, rebuilt or many times completely rejected. This is the basis of the scientific method. Clearly core concepts such as models, fossils, the role of geology and the scientific method must be included in your explanation.Eventually the reductionist approach will reach the atom, and inevitably the diversity of atoms (N, H, O, Fe). Atoms are what physical matter is made of, and atoms themselves are made up of neutrons, electrons, and positrons, but let’s stop the reductionist trip here.Where did all this matter come from? Well matter essentially derived from old stars in space that collapsed and left orbiting stardust trails. They in turn collapsed into other stardust clouds forming bigger chunks, and so on until those chunks were big as a planet. Mix this with the irradiating energy from active stars - such as our Sun - and gravity forces, and you “cook” the current planet we now live in.That energy irradiated from the Sun is in the form of electromagnetic waves spanning a very broad spectrum of frequencies. And indeed part of these waves are the reason we see things, name the visible light part of the spectrum. We know all this thanks in big part to Newton’s experiments with light. So clearly you can’t miss mentioning him and his experiments with light in your explanation.But the universe is not just stars, Earth’s biology, other planets and energy. There might quite likely be extra-terrestrial creatures inhabiting some part of the universe. Aliens are absolutely a serious and very scientific wonder, it’s one you can’t avoid talking about in your assignment. Everyone is somewhat curious about extra-terrestrial life.Now let’s go back to Earth and all its good things and bad things. From an Earthling’s perspective phenomena like wars and diseases are undoubtedly bad and undesirable. But what if we look at it from a cosmic point of view? It really doesn’t make the universe better or worse, it’s just part of a process.Luckily science has gone a long way, and many of our questions have reasonable answers nowadays. Our human ancestors weren’t so lucky. They observed the world with awe, wondering about things we are certain nowadays thanks to science. Their technology wasn’t as advanced then, so many of their knowledge gaps were filled with inventions such as myths and religious stories. Which along generations derived in the current religious beliefs present in human societies.In summary, you’ve been assigned an herculean task. One cannot easily explain all these topics and link them together in a clear and interesting manner. You would need extraordinary didactic and synthetic abilities. Not mentioning of course a clear and accessible language and solid understanding of most of science’s branches.While you could go and try to accomplish such a task yourself, I would rather recommend you to read “Magic of Reality” instead. It geniusly explains all these topics and many more perfectly. Additionally it does so in an absolutely captivating way. You probably would not accomplish this task better than Dawkins, I certainly would not."

Dawkins is incredibly talented at explaining very complex things and his writing is not boring or nap-inducing at all. LOVE! the artwork is also top-notch and really helped clarify some of the more abstract ideas in this book. The Magic of Reality really puts all other science text books to shame. "
680,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6974559-jo-jo,4,"This book lets us realize how ridiculous myths are and why they are written. By giving one or two mythical explanations then the more complicated and more sensible. My favorite chapter was the last one where if something unusual happend not to rule out the possibility of magic but to see what was the most likely explanation was. This an example from the book. A dealer deals out a pack of 52 playing cards to four men and every one gets all the same suit here are three explanations1. The dealer has used magic2. It is pure chance ( the odds against this are 536,447,737,765,488,792,839,237,440,000 to 1)3. The dealer has arranged the cards I think 3 probably happend. But the other chapters are more complicated theres quite a bit about space, natural selection, and atoms.  "

Nonetheless, Dawkins is a great teacher and does not necessarily talk down to his readers; I found the tone just fine contrary to some complaints. Dawkin just wanted the book to be accessible to all, including teenegers and slows like me :). The book answers (eloquently) all questions that 'you were afraid to ask but wanted to (really) know' such as; who was the first person, when did the universe began, is rainbow as simple as it's described, what is the sun---how it came about....e.t.cI liked how he started by describing myths involved in each question and the way he progressed towards the real magic; the magic of here and now. It's a perfect five!"

But lo' n' behold, in an overcrowded airport book shop, it managed to creep into my possession nonetheless. I should have stayed with my initial assesment.It's not really a bad book. It's superbly written for 10-12 year olds. My biggest problem was the condescending tone of the narrative and the fact that I did not learn a single new fact, if you disregard a few myths I hadn't encountered before. It's just a rehash - tremendously simplified - of things I've been over many times before. Buy it for your children, nephews or nieces. If you're the least bit scientifically inclined, you do not need to read it for yourself."
683,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30877314-francis-chin,4,"The best way to review this fascinating book is to give you an excerpt where Dawkins asks whether we have ever been sexually assaulted by demons, abducted by aliens or attacked by vampires. To many folks who said yes, their experience was real as far as they are concerned. But does it mean demons and vampires exist?Here’s the explanation by scientist Richard Dawkins in his book, The Magic of Reality – how we know what’s really true (2011):FALSE memory syndrome helps us understand why at least some of the people who think they have been abducted by aliens claim to have such vivid memories of the incident. What usually happens is that a person becomes obsessed with aliens through reading stories in the newspapers about other alleged abductions. Often, these people are fans of Star Trek or other science fiction tales. It is a striking fact that the aliens they think they’ve met usually look very like the ones portrayed in the most recent television fiction about aliens, and they usually do the same kind of ""experiments"" as have recently been seen on television.The next thing that may happen is that the person is afflicted by a frightening experience called sleep paralysis. It is not uncommon.You may even have experienced it yourself, in which case I hope it will be a bit less scary the next time it happens if I explain it to you now.Normally, when you are asleep and dreaming, your body is paralysed. I supposed it’s to stop your muscles working in tune with your dreams and making you sleepwalk (though this does, of course, sometimes happen). And normally, when you wake and your dream vanishes, the paralysis goes and you can move your muscles.But occasionally there is a delay between your mind returning to consciousness and your muscles coming back to life, and that is called sleep paralysis. It is frightening, as you can imagine. You are sort of awake, and you can see your bedroom and everything in it, but you can’t move. Sleep paralysis is often accompanied by terrifying hallucinations. People feel surrounded by a sense of dreadful danger, which they can’t put a name to. Sometimes they even see things that are not there, just as in a dream. And, also as in a dream, to the dreamer they seem absolutely real. Now, if you are going to have a hallucination when you suffer sleep paralysis, what might that hallucination look like? A modern science fiction fan might well see little grey men with big heads and wraparound eyes. In earlier centuries, before science fiction came along, the visions people saw were different: hobgoblins, perhaps, or werewolves; bloodsucking vampires or (if they were lucky) beautiful winged angels.The point is that the images people see when experiencing sleep paralysis are not really there but are conjured up in the mind from past fears, legends or fiction. Even if they don’t hallucinate, the experience is so frightening that, when they finally wake up, sleep paralysis victims often believe that something horrible has happened to them. If you are primed to believe in vampires, you might wake with a strong belief that a bloodsucker has attacked you. If I am primed to believe in alien abductions I might wake up believing that I was abducted and my memory then wiped clean by aliens.The next thing that typically happens to sleep paralysis victims is that, even if they didn’t actually hallucinate aliens and gruesome experiments at the time, their fearful reconstruction of what they suspect may have happened becomes consolidated as a false memory. This process is often helped along by friends and family, who eagerly pump them for more and more detailed accounts of what happened, and even prompt them with leading questions: “Were there aliens there? What colour were they? Were they grey? Did they have big wraparound eyes like in the movies?”Even questions can be enough to implant or cement a false memory. When you look at it like this, it is not so surprising that a 1992 poll concluded that nearly four million Americans thought they had been abducted by aliens.Psychologist Sue Blackmore points out that sleep paralysis was the most likely cause of earlier imagined horrors, too, before the idea of space aliens became popular. In medieval times people claimed to have been visited in the middle of the night by an ‘incubus’ (a male demon visiting a female victim to have sex with her) or ‘succubus’ (a female demon visiting a male victim to have sex with him). One of the effects of sleep paralysis is that, if you try to move, it feels as though something is pressing down on your body. This could easily be interpreted by the terrified victim as a sexual assault.Legend in Newfoundland talks of an Old Hag who visits people in the night and presses down on their chests. And there is a legend in Indochina of a Grey Ghost who visits people in the dark and paralyses them.So we have a good understanding of why people believe they have been abducted by aliens, and we can tie the modern myths of alien abduction in with earlier myths of rapacious incubi and succubi, or of vampires with long canine teeth who visit in the night and suck our blood. There is no good evidence at all that this planet has ever been visited by aliens from outer space (or, for that matter, by incubi or succubi or demons of any kind). But we are still left with the question of whether there actually are living things on other planets. Just because they haven’t visited us it doesn’t mean they don’t exist. Could the same process of evolution, or even a very different process that perhaps resembles our kind of evolution only slightly, have got going on other planets as well as ours?End of excerptBy the way, read Hallucinations by Dr Oliver Sacks (2012), for a detailed description of how an individual (including Dr Sacks himself) sees and interacts with things, humans and other creatures created inside their mind. As far as the individual is concerned, everything before his or her eyes is real and solid. Dr Sacks mentions that one Sunday morning, two friends Jim and Katy, dropped by his house. He went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast for them. Here's Dr Sacks account: ""Then, five minutes later, I shouted, 'Everything's ready,' put their ham and eggs on a tray, walked into the living room—and found it empty. No Jim, no Kathy, no sign that they had ever been there. I was so staggered I almost dropped the tray. It had not occurred to me for an instant that Jim and Kathy's voices, their 'presences', were unreal, hallucinatory. We had had a friendly, ordinary conversation, just as we usually had.Their voices were the same as always—there was no hint, until I opened the swinging doors and found the living room empty, that the whole conversation, at least their side of it, had been invented by my brain.PS. In my own edition of Dawkin's book, there were some fabulous illustrations including the scary one of a demon squatting on a sleeping woman. It's a pity this web site doesn't have a section to display images. Message me if you want to see the sleep demon!"
684,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,5,"Ricky Gervais says of The Magic of Reality: “I wanted to write this book but I wasn’t clever enough. Now I’ve read it, I am.” I've found that Dawkins gets more readable the more he writes. Simpler than Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" (simpler, of course, because this was written for children and young adults, but I venture to say that a considerable percentage of the American voting population could learn something from this book), Dawkins does a wonderful job addressing myths and reality in a rational, non-confrontational way - atypical for the Dawkins of late...the non-confrontational, that is.Recommended. Even for adults. Especially for children."
685,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"A wonderful & ""magical"" book! Clearly intended (also) for younger readers, Richard Dawkins explains elemantary facts and phenomena of life (rainbows, earthquakes, evolution etc) in his clearly unique way. And by doing so he reveals how magical our world as experienced thanks to and through science already is - without tales of magic, miracles and other nonsense.Unfortunately, neither my Kindle edition nor the paperback version are as beautifully illustrated as the hardcover apparently is (except for the small illustrations at the beginning of each chapter). But I bought the book because of Dawkins and the science facts so it's not really a downer."
686,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5814532-jim,4,"What a fascinating book. I realize this is written at a rather primary level, but there's so much here that was just never covered when I was going through school that it almost seemed new to me. The beauty of science. The magic of reality. Dawkins does a great job in showing us how amazing nature is. Of course, there's the requisite, constant reminder that all and every religion is completely and crazily untrue, and that gets pretty old. But the real stuff - the science - is just plain cool. Very enjoyable read. Of course, Dave McKean's illustrations merely serve to make the book that much better. Recommended. "
687,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"Once again, I found Richard Dawkins a Pleasure to read. In this book, he illustrates a number of areas in science. On each topic, he gives some of the various myths on the topic at hand; then he presents the science behind it. Science wins out. Dawkins just has the knack of explanation—keeping it fresh and interesting. One example is, the red shift of the galaxies as evidence for the big bang. It is explained that the spectrum of the light shows the the same patterns, but they are shift to the red. I read about this numerous times. This is the first time I caught on to how scientist can tell that the light is shifted. For Dawkins fans or not, I can recommend this book."
688,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164533-lilit,5,"The book is meant for younger audience as it provides very basic, yet coherent, very structured and still exciting, information on the subjects discussed. Moreover, the style of starting every chapter with myths followed by the scientific evidence is rather impactful. The book challenges your mind in terms of prompting you to think what are all the other myths that we have accepted as reality and seldom think whether they REALLY are TRUE. It is not a dull science book! I was impressed by how well Dawkins managed to trigger my imagination to clearly picture all the things described in his book. "
689,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6820027-peter-cawdron,5,"I'm reading this with my kids at night on the iPad, which is an excellent medium, as it has the entire book plus beautiful illustrations and a number of interactive features, like breeding frogs over successive generations to see if they can survive predation by snakes. The kids loved experimenting with that, seeing how the concept of selection works first hand. This is a book you'll love reading with your kids, and is suitable for children from 8-14 (plus there's plenty for us old farts to learn too)"
690,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33410234-dan-croft,3,"This book started out well enough; somewhat like The Universe in a Nutshell or similar books about science. I'd say the subject matter discussed is pretty basic for anyone who has a working knowledge of high school and maybe some college level chemistry, biology, physics, etc. Even so, Dawkins has an entertaining and enjoyable writing style, which make it fun to listen, even if it is review. In the beginning of the book Dawkins seem to have a genuine interest in helping the novice person interested in science (but with no background in it) understand some basic precepts. As the book progresses, particularly in the last two chapters, the purpose of the book appears to shift from science education to debunking the supernatural aspects of religion. Dawkins is a well known and outspoken atheist, so it is certainly understandable why he would want to point out his views. However, towards the end he begins to become repetitive, which really grinds down the reader. His points are valid and well taken, but he fails to give any credit to religion as anything more than mythology that should be interpreted literally. The fact that he fails to acknowledge religion as a more abstract philosophy and code of ethics leads the reader to believe that he, not the reader, is the one missing the point. "
691,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237803-m,4,"As one of the reviews on the cover described it, ""A Perfect Introduction to Science"", which it is indeed. Another well-written book by Richard Dawkins, much lighter and simpler than most of his books, mainly targeting more general readers serving to find the magic in truth rather than myths, and to show how reality can be sometimes more entertaining than fiction. For me, there was little new there but I thoroughly enjoyed the way it was written and the calm and patient approach to explaining scientific concepts. Each chapter discussed a scientific topic or phenomenon, it started with listing some of the legends that tried to explain this subject, then slowly discussing the scientific explanation of the phenomenon focusing on the beauty of the truth and how it can be more magical (not in the supernatural sense of the word) than the myths and fantasies created and passed on over generations.This is an essential read to help increase basic science literacy. The light version of science here might appeal to the general reader who finds it difficult to read a science book. The introduction and final chapter can serve as an eye-opener for some readers, though you would normally think that a Richard Dawkins' reader will normally be already familiar with these ideas."
692,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22748104-josh-taylor,2,"I think the pilgrimage Dawkins is on trying to teaching people the illogicality of their ways and show them there is beauty in science is fine, admirable in a way. But people that do not agree with that line of thought are hardly likely to pick up one of Dawkins books. So why preach to the converted? What I found as a scientist was a book filled with common sense explanation.The illogical beliefs/theory’s that people hold that he disproves through explanation, although well explained are trivial and therefore his explanations come across in my opinion as patronizing to the reader. And I would have thought that to be the case for the majority of people who read this book science layman or not. I am not having a go at Dawkins I just think he is out of touch with the times, the Selfish Gene was revolutionary and shocking at the time of its release due to its controversial contents compared to the widely held believes of the populous at the time. Now I feel like he’s trying to do the same thing. I thought this book would highlight the mind bending and amazing things that are happening in modern science such as quantum entanglement stuff that makes you go WOW. Instead it was just a dig at the minority of people that hold certain beliefs. "
693,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48066-chazzle,4,"I really enjoyed this book about general science, and how we know what we know. Although written at a middle school level, interesting observations abound. For example, suppose you look through a telescope at a star that's 100 million light years away. That means you're looking at something that happened 100 million years ago. As such, if you happened to be observing intelligent life looking at us, they would be seeing dinosaurs, not you, in the present moment! Wild! This is an example of the poetic magic of reality, giving the book's title.I happened upon a youtube video with Bill O'Reilly interviewing author Richard Dawkins, while actually trying to find another link recommended by the author in the book itself. And O'Reilly's point is true, IMHO. Indeed, the author does spend a good portion of time dismantling the miracle stories of various religions, including Christianity, in a book marketed to the young. So, if you're a biblical literalist, or prefer that your child not have the miracle accounts in his scripture debunked, this might not be the book for you. As I see it, though, Dawkins' grip on reality is much, much firmer than O'Reilly's."
694,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1784379-jess-cattanach,4,"The Magic of Reality is the first Dawkins book I’ve read, but I feel like it was a good introduction to his works. Relatively short and easily digestible, this book is perfect for a quick read between tasks. Dawkins addresses a number of things that many people have little scientific understanding about, and introduces each chapter in a very nifty fashion: by describing some of the myths people have come up with over the years to describe the phenomena. After this humorous introduction he goes on to explain what actually occurs in a way that is both scientifically sound and understandable, even for those with no science background.I may be a little biased, being a science student and overall science geek, but I really did enjoy this book. Dawkins’ writing style flows together quite nicely and even if you know how one of the processes work he writes it in a way that makes it still engaging to read.Really, I think the thing that makes this book stand out is its wonderful contrast between myth and reality (hence the title!) It very neatly wraps up, too, that everything has a sound explanation, even if we are yet to find out what that explanation is. "
695,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,3,"Standing on its own, I should give this book 5 stars. It is written for an audience that is not science literate and it not only does the job but it actually very enligtening and gives the reader a sense of joy vis-a-vis astronomy and other forms of science.That said, I rated it 3 starts because I'm comparing it to his other books which were so much better. I'm still not sure how this rating system works but I tend not to rate a book on its own merit but to compare it to other books the same author has written - that is, if I've read other books by the same author. So maybe my ""3"" is not altogether fair.Getting back to the book, this one would be a FANTASTIC book assignment for high school students who are taking science classes and are struggling with the Big Questions like, ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" Why is this or that thing bad luck?"" ... you get the idea. Dawkins turns the reader to science and helps her to understand that there are marvelous and surreal experiences to be had aside from subscribing circumstances to superstition."
696,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310403-kyle,3,"A handbook for junior sceptics and parents not wanting their children growing up deluded about gods, myths or magic, Dawkins covers a lot of ground from earliest traces of life on earth to the reason rainbows appear in the sky, plus how the planets and stars maintain their relative position to our rotating/revolving peppercorn. There are a few fields he dares not enter, such as quarks and other subatomic processes, which he leaves out of the book. Most chapters seem as backwards as the title: in attempting to prove the reality of what others would claim to be magic, he gives a passing description of what scientists have observed that are preceded by the wild and occasionally amusing myths from around the world, all of which are assuredly wrong. Wouldn't more children be interested in being talked up to by learning a scientific concept first, and then finding out the amazing variety of stories different cultures have provided to explain the concept without science but with a more alchemical sense of reality?"
697,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17891225-karnika-kapoor,4,"It was interesting to read about the mythological stories from different cultures and eras. I was rather more impressed by ""The God Delusion"" than by ""The magic of reality"". Perhaps, because it was my first Richard Dawkins's book and I was hugely impressed by the argument made there (as the same was in my subconscious all my life). The debunking of myth in this book is something not very new to me. However, it includes bits and peaces of information that I was not aware of and I profoundly enjoyed gaining information about those bits. I specifically liked the part related to ""sleep paralysis"" as I experience the same quite often. Back in my ""Theistic"" days, I use to relate it with supernatural (Guilty as charged). But as I started to think rationally over things, it was not quite logical to follow. I recommend this book to people seeking an empirical evidence against the so-called ""miracle"" of past. A typical Dawkins style approach to encourage people to think rationally. I enjoyed reading it. "
698,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6137539-david-h,0,"Magic Reality is a very good children's book on general science. It is based strictly on evolution and cosmology. It is Richard Dawkins way of fighting what he called The God Delusion in an earlier book. Once this delusion takes hold of the mind, it cannot be removed. So it must not be allowed in at all. Children must never be taught about God or any supernatural creatures except as myths. A child's view of reality must be the child's first view of reality. Because it is new, it will seem magic. Hence the title, The Magic of Reality. Children are natural-born scientists. Any intelligent observer of children at play will see this. They observe, they wonder, they test, they wonder some more...until some stupid adult pulls them away and fills their little heads with Adam and Eve and the snake and the apple. So Dawkins has written a book as much fun as fairy tales, as exciting as pirate stories, and as full of true spirituality as any of the crap they teach in Sunday School."
699,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5731693-jerry-stroh,4,"This children's book by Richard Dawkins & illustrated by Dave McKean (of Sandman fame) is great and I highly recommend it to anyone, even adults, because there is a lot of info here which even I didn't know about science - and I mean general stuff that in an ideal world, nobody with a public school education shouldn't know - and again, like most of Dawkins' books, it makes science interesting. My favorite part was about rainbows. I think every child around 10 should be given this book to read. Right about the time they learn the truth about Santa Claus. You know, when it's the right time to teach children the difference between fiction and reality. So they understand that rainbows are formed by light reflected through falling rain and were not created by 'God' after the myth of Noah and his crowded ark, for example. And other stuff about the reality of evolution and the fiction of the supernatural."
700,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7664274-sarah,3,"I'm in no way a scientific genius. My brain is ruled by myth and magic more than logic and hard facts. That's not to say that I don't adore learning about the world and learning about the reality of the times in which we live. I suppose that's why I was drawn to this book- 'The Magic of Reality'. What a fantastic title! I was also encouraged by the fact that this book was written 'for people of all generations' and yes, it was easy to understand. Dawkins has a remarkable ability to flawlessly simplify really difficult science. I think there's something very appealing about a scientist who can make physics and chemistry appealing and relateable. My only issue was that, at times, it was patronising and holier than thou. I may not be a religious person, but even then I felt that Dawkins took some cheap shots against religious beliefs. Yes yes, we all get it, science and religion are on opposite wavelengths. You don't need to be a jackass about it. "
701,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30553624-mrsagnello,5,"I really enjoyed this piece. Listening to it as an audiobook was particularly effective, I think, because you could hear the joy and excitement in the readers' voices (read partially by Dawkins, partially by a woman). Essentially, this book is a review of high school science, but without the irritations, boredom, and hormones. Dawkins shows a genuine love of science and shares his enthusiasm through well-crafted prose that, thought it dives into challenges topics, never felt stuffy or too challenging. I would recommend this as a fantastic book for anyone interested in how the world works, especially as a primer to reading more in-depth works, such as A Short History of Nearly Everything. Additionally, I would recommend this book to any ""baby"" atheist looking for information about how the world works. "

This book is an example of the great scientific interesting vulgarisation. Starting from ""What is reality?"" till ""What is miracle?"", I couldn't predict what author gonna say before I enter into an actual chapter. I guess, there his brilliance challenging us. Sometimes, I wonder how can he touch so easily those sensitive topics , commenting on it and cleverly driving us to believe in it etc. Magic Vs Reality, Gods,Myth Vs Sceince , DNA Evolution, Dromerdeener, gene pool etc He is answering for all crazy questions in an intelligent funny acceptable way... haha... Simply I love his writing. I enjoyed each and every line of this book. The time I took to complete this or chew his thoughts can show , how much I enjoyed his writing by reading it again and again. :) I strongly recommend for all. Hats off Dawkins!"
703,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6874323-thomas-ray,1,"This is not so much a book of science, as an attack on religion. And, it's not an attack on religion as it is, but as the author imagines it to be. In the author's misunderstood view, religion is merely and solely a poor man's science, whose purpose was just to describe the cosmos mythologically, when we didn't know any better--and we should be done with religion by now. To the contrary, religion is about developing spiritual strength, to prepare oneself for the moments of moral crisis in life. Without that strength, we lack the needed grace, fall from the path, and suffer. The author doesn't know this, as he hasn't bothered to find out. Instead, he relies on his preconceived, wrong notions of religion. And writes about religion without understanding what it's about. The author's approach to writing about religion is the reverse of scientific. It's dogmatic."

This book is a kind of ""Cliff Notes"" on most elementary, and important, scientific topics like natural evolution, Newtonian/Copernicus astronomy, the nature of atoms etc. There is not much to be learnt for anyone who has gone through the high school science courses without sleeping. The author's objectives are different (or same if you have read him before): to debunk the non-scientific, particularly religious notions of how we came in to being. So while the book brings little that would be new to seasoned readers (of almost any kind), the way the book is put together makes it an easy read with many interesting myths, anecdotes and language twists to describe some scientific concepts. The book is more useful for teens and/or people at impressionable ages."

Another reason I liked it tremendously is that I had my first audio book experience with it; where Dawkins reads through all the chapters with his wife. Although some information presented was basic and sometimes critical of beliefs and religious thoughts, the way it was illustrated was fascinating as each chapter starts with a myth and then is explained scientifically. Questions like ""What is an earthquake?"" and "" What is the sun?"" are answered. This book is quite suitable for all ages, and it really evokes wonderment in you. I particularly loved how he explained magic in the first chapter, and how the most beauty lies in the poetic-and real sense of the world. It is true, the magic of unraveling a mystery and the road to discovery is indeed, beautiful."

People who are about age 12 and above can read this book. The type of the book is non-fiction, science, true stories, legends, theories and thoughts. I’ve chosen this book because my friend told me to read it. There are 12 chapters in it, each chapter has real question like what is rainbow? What’s the sun? Etc. Moreover, Richard answers to those questions logically and realistic it’s kind of magic if you imagine and think about it. I really enjoy reading it and the best part was in the first chapter, its talk about biology and I really love anything about biology. Also the writer talks about the scientist. Richard impressed me so I did a search for him and I found that he’s an English ethnologist and evolutionary biologist. "
707,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13514620-matilda-rose,3,"Each chapter in this book explains the question in the title of that chapter. The first chapter explains what magic is. According to Richard Dawkins, there are three different types of magic - supernatural magic, stage magic, and poetic magic. Supernatural magic is something not scientifically possible, something that only happens in fairytales. Stage magic is an illusion to make you think what you’re seeing is magic, but it’s really all just a complex trick.The book ends with ‘What is a miracle?’, in which Dawkins talks about how to decide what a miracle is. Decide the possible explanations and select the most likely. It’s probably just a coincidence. Some coincidences can become what seems a miracle by exaggerated re-tellings.I thought this book was okay. It was written well, and a few of the things I was interested in, but as far non-fiction books go, it was good!"
708,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31189533-toni,5,"SHORTDawkins captivatingly guides us through the realms of science, and contrasts it with mythical beliefs. Enlightening new knowledge that gives one a new vision of nature.MEDIUM At the cover of this book’s edition there’s a short summary by Ricky Gervais which says essentially that this book makes you smarter. I could not agree more. Reading this book will most likely fill some knowledge gap for you that you weren’t aware of. It sure did for me. Chapters often start with old - and not so old - myths and religious stories regarding topics of reality life. These stories are then contrasted with science’s explanations to the same phenomena. Such a structure displays the superior strength of science over non-evidence based beliefs. Dawkins guides us delightfully through the realms of biology, astronomy, physics, ethics, and many more. Without a doubt this book will enlighten you in some way or another, it will make you wonder and observe things in nature differently. I profoundly enjoyed the trip.LONGESTImagine you are assigned with the task of explaining to your young teenager cousin the origin of biology as we know and live it. You will have to mention how diverse life on Earth is, even beyond science’s reach. And how it’s organized - sometimes fuzzily - in different kingdoms: plants, animals, microscopic life… How can one tackle such an assignment?One reasonable option is to opt for a reductionist - macro to micro - approach. We start off with a complex being such as an elephant, then “simplify” down to a fly that probably flies around it. From here we can focus on the uni-neuronal worm crawling around the same scene, then the grass our elephant is stepping on until the point we include a simple bacteria floating in the pond on the ground. You know these beings - and all the rest on the planet including us humans - are all related, part of their DNA is shared. They all derive from the same ancestor - millions of years ago. But how can you explain their relationship? One word: evolution. Evolution must certainly be part of your explanation then, it links all these seemingly unrelated beings together.You may be asked this question, understandably: how can we know what happened millions of years ago? The answer is that scientists infer it from fossils and geological layers. Fossils are preserved instances of past living creatures that often no longer exist at the same evolutionary step. So they don’t exist but yet they are real? Precisely, reality is not just what we see or know, it’s also what used to exist in one shape or another. How can we understand things that don’t exist and don’t have access to? By using models. Building models allows scientists to fill the gaps missing in the knowledge puzzle. As new evidence appears those models are refined, rebuilt or many times completely rejected. This is the basis of the scientific method. Clearly core concepts such as models, fossils, the role of geology and the scientific method must be included in your explanation.Eventually the reductionist approach will reach the atom, and inevitably the diversity of atoms (N, H, O, Fe). Atoms are what physical matter is made of, and atoms themselves are made up of neutrons, electrons, and positrons, but let’s stop the reductionist trip here.Where did all this matter come from? Well matter essentially derived from old stars in space that collapsed and left orbiting stardust trails. They in turn collapsed into other stardust clouds forming bigger chunks, and so on until those chunks were big as a planet. Mix this with the irradiating energy from active stars - such as our Sun - and gravity forces, and you “cook” the current planet we now live in.That energy irradiated from the Sun is in the form of electromagnetic waves spanning a very broad spectrum of frequencies. And indeed part of these waves are the reason we see things, name the visible light part of the spectrum. We know all this thanks in big part to Newton’s experiments with light. So clearly you can’t miss mentioning him and his experiments with light in your explanation.But the universe is not just stars, Earth’s biology, other planets and energy. There might quite likely be extra-terrestrial creatures inhabiting some part of the universe. Aliens are absolutely a serious and very scientific wonder, it’s one you can’t avoid talking about in your assignment. Everyone is somewhat curious about extra-terrestrial life.Now let’s go back to Earth and all its good things and bad things. From an Earthling’s perspective phenomena like wars and diseases are undoubtedly bad and undesirable. But what if we look at it from a cosmic point of view? It really doesn’t make the universe better or worse, it’s just part of a process.Luckily science has gone a long way, and many of our questions have reasonable answers nowadays. Our human ancestors weren’t so lucky. They observed the world with awe, wondering about things we are certain nowadays thanks to science. Their technology wasn’t as advanced then, so many of their knowledge gaps were filled with inventions such as myths and religious stories. Which along generations derived in the current religious beliefs present in human societies.In summary, you’ve been assigned an herculean task. One cannot easily explain all these topics and link them together in a clear and interesting manner. You would need extraordinary didactic and synthetic abilities. Not mentioning of course a clear and accessible language and solid understanding of most of science’s branches.While you could go and try to accomplish such a task yourself, I would rather recommend you to read “Magic of Reality” instead. It geniusly explains all these topics and many more perfectly. Additionally it does so in an absolutely captivating way. You probably would not accomplish this task better than Dawkins, I certainly would not."
709,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1209894-sara-frances,5,"this book is awesome, like life-changing awesome. if i had read this book as a little girl (not that my parents would have let me anywhere near this book when i was little) i might be a scientist right now, for real. sadly i'm too old and dumb to totally change things up like that. but this book has installed a new sense of wonderment in me about how fantastically interesting our universe and life is. Dawkins is incredibly talented at explaining very complex things and his writing is not boring or nap-inducing at all. LOVE! the artwork is also top-notch and really helped clarify some of the more abstract ideas in this book. The Magic of Reality really puts all other science text books to shame. "
710,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6974559-jo-jo,4,"This book lets us realize how ridiculous myths are and why they are written. By giving one or two mythical explanations then the more complicated and more sensible. My favorite chapter was the last one where if something unusual happend not to rule out the possibility of magic but to see what was the most likely explanation was. This an example from the book. A dealer deals out a pack of 52 playing cards to four men and every one gets all the same suit here are three explanations1. The dealer has used magic2. It is pure chance ( the odds against this are 536,447,737,765,488,792,839,237,440,000 to 1)3. The dealer has arranged the cards I think 3 probably happend.

Nonetheless, Dawkins is a great teacher and does not necessarily talk down to his readers; I found the tone just fine contrary to some complaints. Dawkin just wanted the book to be accessible to all, including teenegers and slows like me :). The book answers (eloquently) all questions that 'you were afraid to ask but wanted to (really) know' such as; who was the first person, when did the universe began, is rainbow as simple as it's described, what is the sun---how it came about....e.t.cI liked how he started by describing myths involved in each question and the way he progressed towards the real magic; the magic of here and now. It's a perfect five!"

But lo' n' behold, in an overcrowded airport book shop, it managed to creep into my possession nonetheless. I should have stayed with my initial assesment.It's not really a bad book. It's superbly written for 10-12 year olds. My biggest problem was the condescending tone of the narrative and the fact that I did not learn a single new fact, if you disregard a few myths I hadn't encountered before. It's just a rehash - tremendously simplified - of things I've been over many times before. Buy it for your children, nephews or nieces. If you're the least bit scientifically inclined, you do not need to read it for yourself."
713,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30877314-francis-chin,4,"The best way to review this fascinating book is to give you an excerpt where Dawkins asks whether we have ever been sexually assaulted by demons, abducted by aliens or attacked by vampires. To many folks who said yes, their experience was real as far as they are concerned. But does it mean demons and vampires exist?Here’s the explanation by scientist Richard Dawkins in his book, The Magic of Reality – how we know what’s really true (2011):FALSE memory syndrome helps us understand why at least some of the people who think they have been abducted by aliens claim to have such vivid memories of the incident. What usually happens is that a person becomes obsessed with aliens through reading stories in the newspapers about other alleged abductions. Often, these people are fans of Star Trek or other science fiction tales. It is a striking fact that the aliens they think they’ve met usually look very like the ones portrayed in the most recent television fiction about aliens, and they usually do the same kind of ""experiments"" as have recently been seen on television.The next thing that may happen is that the person is afflicted by a frightening experience called sleep paralysis. It is not uncommon.You may even have experienced it yourself, in which case I hope it will be a bit less scary the next time it happens if I explain it to you now.Normally, when you are asleep and dreaming, your body is paralysed. I supposed it’s to stop your muscles working in tune with your dreams and making you sleepwalk (though this does, of course, sometimes happen). And normally, when you wake and your dream vanishes, the paralysis goes and you can move your muscles.But occasionally there is a delay between your mind returning to consciousness and your muscles coming back to life, and that is called sleep paralysis. It is frightening, as you can imagine. You are sort of awake, and you can see your bedroom and everything in it, but you can’t move. Sleep paralysis is often accompanied by terrifying hallucinations. People feel surrounded by a sense of dreadful danger, which they can’t put a name to. Sometimes they even see things that are not there, just as in a dream. And, also as in a dream, to the dreamer they seem absolutely real. Now, if you are going to have a hallucination when you suffer sleep paralysis, what might that hallucination look like? A modern science fiction fan might well see little grey men with big heads and wraparound eyes. In earlier centuries, before science fiction came along, the visions people saw were different: hobgoblins, perhaps, or werewolves; bloodsucking vampires or (if they were lucky) beautiful winged angels.The point is that the images people see when experiencing sleep paralysis are not really there but are conjured up in the mind from past fears, legends or fiction. Even if they don’t hallucinate, the experience is so frightening that, when they finally wake up, sleep paralysis victims often believe that something horrible has happened to them. If you are primed to believe in vampires, you might wake with a strong belief that a bloodsucker has attacked you. If I am primed to believe in alien abductions I might wake up believing that I was abducted and my memory then wiped clean by aliens.The next thing that typically happens to sleep paralysis victims is that, even if they didn’t actually hallucinate aliens and gruesome experiments at the time, their fearful reconstruction of what they suspect may have happened becomes consolidated as a false memory. This process is often helped along by friends and family, who eagerly pump them for more and more detailed accounts of what happened, and even prompt them with leading questions: “Were there aliens there? What colour were they? Were they grey? Did they have big wraparound eyes like in the movies?”Even questions can be enough to implant or cement a false memory. When you look at it like this, it is not so surprising that a 1992 poll concluded that nearly four million Americans thought they had been abducted by aliens.Psychologist Sue Blackmore points out that sleep paralysis was the most likely cause of earlier imagined horrors, too, before the idea of space aliens became popular. In medieval times people claimed to have been visited in the middle of the night by an ‘incubus’ (a male demon visiting a female victim to have sex with her) or ‘succubus’ (a female demon visiting a male victim to have sex with him). One of the effects of sleep paralysis is that, if you try to move, it feels as though something is pressing down on your body. This could easily be interpreted by the terrified victim as a sexual assault.Legend in Newfoundland talks of an Old Hag who visits people in the night and presses down on their chests. And there is a legend in Indochina of a Grey Ghost who visits people in the dark and paralyses them.So we have a good understanding of why people believe they have been abducted by aliens, and we can tie the modern myths of alien abduction in with earlier myths of rapacious incubi and succubi, or of vampires with long canine teeth who visit in the night and suck our blood. There is no good evidence at all that this planet has ever been visited by aliens from outer space (or, for that matter, by incubi or succubi or demons of any kind). But we are still left with the question of whether there actually are living things on other planets. Just because they haven’t visited us it doesn’t mean they don’t exist. Could the same process of evolution, or even a very different process that perhaps resembles our kind of evolution only slightly, have got going on other planets as well as ours?End of excerptBy the way, read Hallucinations by Dr Oliver Sacks (2012), for a detailed description of how an individual (including Dr Sacks himself) sees and interacts with things, humans and other creatures created inside their mind. As far as the individual is concerned, everything before his or her eyes is real and solid. Dr Sacks mentions that one Sunday morning, two friends Jim and Katy, dropped by his house. He went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast for them. Here's Dr Sacks account: ""Then, five minutes later, I shouted, 'Everything's ready,' put their ham and eggs on a tray, walked into the living room—and found it empty. No Jim, no Kathy, no sign that they had ever been there. I was so staggered I almost dropped the tray. It had not occurred to me for an instant that Jim and Kathy's voices, their 'presences', were unreal, hallucinatory. We had had a friendly, ordinary conversation, just as we usually had.Their voices were the same as always—there was no hint, until I opened the swinging doors and found the living room empty, that the whole conversation, at least their side of it, had been invented by my brain.PS. In my own edition of Dawkin's book, there were some fabulous illustrations including the scary one of a demon squatting on a sleeping woman. It's a pity this web site doesn't have a section to display images. Message me if you want to see the sleep demon!"
714,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,5,"Ricky Gervais says of The Magic of Reality: “I wanted to write this book but I wasn’t clever enough. Now I’ve read it, I am.” I've found that Dawkins gets more readable the more he writes. Simpler than Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" (simpler, of course, because this was written for children and young adults, but I venture to say that a considerable percentage of the American voting population could learn something from this book), Dawkins does a wonderful job addressing myths and reality in a rational, non-confrontational way - atypical for the Dawkins of late...the non-confrontational, that is.Recommended. Even for adults. Especially for children."
715,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"A wonderful & ""magical"" book! Clearly intended (also) for younger readers, Richard Dawkins explains elemantary facts and phenomena of life (rainbows, earthquakes, evolution etc) in his clearly unique way. And by doing so he reveals how magical our world as experienced thanks to and through science already is - without tales of magic, miracles and other nonsense.Unfortunately, neither my Kindle edition nor the paperback version are as beautifully illustrated as the hardcover apparently is (except for the small illustrations at the beginning of each chapter). But I bought the book because of Dawkins and the science facts so it's not really a downer."
716,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5814532-jim,4,"What a fascinating book. I realize this is written at a rather primary level, but there's so much here that was just never covered when I was going through school that it almost seemed new to me. The beauty of science. The magic of reality. Dawkins does a great job in showing us how amazing nature is. Of course, there's the requisite, constant reminder that all and every religion is completely and crazily untrue, and that gets pretty old. But the real stuff - the science - is just plain cool. Very enjoyable read. Of course, Dave McKean's illustrations merely serve to make the book that much better. Recommended. "
717,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"Once again, I found Richard Dawkins a Pleasure to read. In this book, he illustrates a number of areas in science. On each topic, he gives some of the various myths on the topic at hand; then he presents the science behind it. Science wins out. Dawkins just has the knack of explanation—keeping it fresh and interesting. One example is, the red shift of the galaxies as evidence for the big bang. It is explained that the spectrum of the light shows the the same patterns, but they are shift to the red. I read about this numerous times. This is the first time I caught on to how scientist can tell that the light is shifted. For Dawkins fans or not, I can recommend this book."
718,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164533-lilit,5,"The book is meant for younger audience as it provides very basic, yet coherent, very structured and still exciting, information on the subjects discussed. Moreover, the style of starting every chapter with myths followed by the scientific evidence is rather impactful. The book challenges your mind in terms of prompting you to think what are all the other myths that we have accepted as reality and seldom think whether they REALLY are TRUE. It is not a dull science book! I was impressed by how well Dawkins managed to trigger my imagination to clearly picture all the things described in his book. "

The kids loved experimenting with that, seeing how the concept of selection works first hand. This is a book you'll love reading with your kids, and is suitable for children from 8-14 (plus there's plenty for us old farts to learn too)"

Well, science is not really about proving anything in our normal understanding of the term. It is about creating ideas which are not disproven, and the whole point of science is to find disproofs of all the existing understanding of science. Further, he really believes that science has to do with disproving ""myths"" such as creation myths. He fails to believe that these myths might be metaphorical, ""best explanations"" that people can come up with, and he uses really bizarre metaphorical language to explain science himself, which is very much worse in my mind than that was in my mind. But, he *does* write well. He is good at telling a story which is easy to get engaged in. So, this aspect managed to get me through this book..."
721,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14115149-jaclynn,3,"Dawkins writes (and has illustrated) a book for teens? Count me in!The good: Clear and accessible. I will be requesting a copy for my 9th grade classroom. Kids are naturally curious and fascinated by how the world works. They're also susceptible to all kinds of nonsense, of course. This much-needed book fill s a gap between simplistic kids' books and adult science books. I like how he started each chapter focusing on a myth that in the past served as an explanation for a natural phenomenon. The not so good: His tone fluctuated so often that in some parts of the book he could have been explaining something to a 10 year old, in other parts he could easily have been speaking to a senior in high school. No consistency. This book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters."

For me, this leaves out the spiritual side of life, and those things we cannot yet, or perhaps ever will explain, and it takes the fun out of the read, and of life.No one, not even he, will find all the answers, and while he does acknowledge what he doesn't know at times, he also doesn't leave his door open to explanations other than scientific, which I am sympathetic to.I think I've learned all I can from him for now.(p.s.- I think HE should read the Biology of Belief and let his own thinking continue to grow up alongside it)"

O well!Beware all ye religious: Dawkins pulls no punches in asserting that most religion is unsubstantiated myth, and his tone (in writing this book for young people) will strike you as especially condescending. I enjoyed the work for the way Dawkins makes his point across such wide-ranging areas of science. Reality really is magical! I also learned: mules are sterile, rainbows are cool, and Newton + prisms put us all to shame. (Is there still something left to discover with a prism?) I also have a new appreciation for the microscope and the way it reveals major plot holes in all major religions for failing to address phenomenon hidden from the naked eye.Curious about the illustrated version!"

738,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14515345-erin-britton,5,"Richard Dawkins’ The Magic of Reality begins with a question: if reality is everything that exists, then how do we know what exists? In many cases this question of existence can be answered easy by recourse to our five senses. Our ability to see, smell, touch, taste and hear provides us with effective means of establishing this reality. However, the question really is: if our senses cannot detect something directly, then how do we know if it’s real? Lots of things can be seen to fall within this puzzle, for example galaxies that are too far away to see, radio waves that cannot be detected by either our eyes or our ears, and even dinosaurs since they are no longer around to be detected by anything. The answer seems to be that we know all of these things exist due to various methods of often complex investigation, investigation that can ultimately be labelled as science.Of course, scientific investigation isn’t the only means of explaining the existence of things and so, before science stepped in with an answer, magic was often credited as being involved. The ancient Egyptians for example explained the existence of night by suggesting that the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. Likewise, the Japanese used to explain earthquakes as being caused when the giant catfish that carried the world on its back flipped its tail. These are clearly extraordinary, magical explanations. However, it could be said that a different kind of magic exists in the discovery of the real answers to question of why things happen. With The Magic of Reality Dawkins therefore seeks to demonstrate that the real would, as it can be understood scientifically, has a magic all of its own.In The Magic of Reality each chapter is dedicated to one particular aspect of reality – whether it be the sun or earthquakes or rainbows or the many species of animals that exists – and investigates how and why that particular thing has come to be. In the chapter concerning “Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?” for example, Dawkins examines the two great rhythms that dominate our lives. He begins with a couple of Aboriginal myths about the day-night cycle as well as the myth of Persephone, before detailing how the seasonal rhythm is explained by the yearly orbiting of the Earth around the sun at a distance of 93 million miles while the daily rhythm is explained by the Earth’s spinning round and round like a top.The Magic of Reality is an immensely interesting book. Richard Dawkins has taken a host of complex and vital topics and has explained them in a clear, concise manner that would suit both the layman and those with some scientific knowledge. Dawkins provides inspiring explanations of space, time, evolution and other matters within the realm of thought experiments and so uses The Magic of Reality to explain an amazingly wide range of natural phenomena. The breadth of topics covered is immense yet Dawkins’ clear explanative style ensures that all information is presented in an accurate and detailed yet straightforward manner that makes it a pleasure rather than a chore to read.One potential disappointment with this particular edition of The Magic of Reality is that it is a special text-only edition. The original hardback edition contained delightful and illuminating colour illustrations from Dave McKean [yes, of Hellblazer and Sandman fame]. The quality of the illustrations resulted in the hardback of The Magic of Reality being a truly beautiful as well as informative volume. It is intended to be a book that explains science in a clear and exuberant fashion that appeals to readers of all ages and the inclusion of the illustrations would have served to broaden its appeal, particularly to young readers. There is another, more expensive, paperback edition due out later this year and it seems likely that that one will be illustrated, so it’s worth considering which edition would be most suited to your particular interests.Despite having lamented the absence of illustrations, the strength of the text of The Magic of Reality must be reiterated. It is a real page-turner of a science book that grips the reader’s imagination from the very beginning and never fails to both enlighten and astonish. The Magic of Reality is an accessible guide to nearly all of the important questions about the nature of life and the universe."
739,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49908117-vijay-akhade,5,"I hope you agree that the truth has a magic of its own. The truth is more magical-in the best and most exciting sense of the word-than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.We may care about fairness and unfairness, but coins don't give a toss! Nor does the universe at large. Bad things happen because things happen. Whether they are bad or good from our point of view doesn't influence how likely it is that they will happen. Some people find it hard to accept this. They'd prefer to think that sinners get their comeuppance, that virtue is rewarded. Unfortunately the universe doesn't care what people prefer.Scientists don't stop at proposing a model: they then go on to test it. They say, 'If this model that I am imagining were true, we would expect to see such-and-such in the real world'. They predict what you""ll find if you do a particular experiment and make certain measurements. A successful model is one whose predictions come out right, especially if they survive the test of experiment. And if the predictions come out right, we hope it means that the model probably represents the truth, or at least a part of the truth.If these'holy books' really were written, or dictated, or inspired, by all-knowing gods, don't you think its odd that these gods said nothing about any of these important and useful things?Is there really life on other planets ? Nobody knows. If you forced me to give an opinion one way or the other, I'd say yes, and probably on millions of planets. But who cares about an opinion ? There is no direct evidence. One of the great virtues of science is that scientists know when they don't know the answer to something. They cheerfully admit that they don't know. Cheerfully, because not knowing the answer is an exciting challenge to try to find it. There is much that remains deeply mysterious, and it is not likely that we will ever uncover all the secrets of a universe as vast as ours: but, armed with science, we can at least ask sensible, meaningful questions about it and recognize credible answers when we find them. We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories : we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy.Don't ever be lazy enough-defeatist enough, cowardly enough-to say 'It must be supernatural'or 'It must be a miracle'. Say instead that it's a puzzle, it's strange, it's a challenge that we should rise to. Whether we rise to the challenge by questioning the truth of the observation, or by expanding our science in new and exciting directions, the proper and brave response to any such challenge is to tackle it head-on. And until we have found a proper answer to the mystery, it's perfectly OK simply to say, ""This is something we don't yet understand, but we're working on it'. Indeed it is the only honest thing to do."

Apparently it's meant for children/young adults? And apparently it's supposed to be illustrated?? Heads up - the paperback is not at all illustrated besides the small images at the start of each chapter. I really have no idea why you would even publish this book without the illustrations if it's meant to be a children/young adults' science book.I started out thinking that excerpts from this book would have been great required reading for a middle school/early high school science class (with the addition of illustrations, of course, to help drive the understanding home), but I quickly realized that that Dawkins's tone is just too condescending and rude for me to want to force that on anyone. Listen, I'm kind of on his side here, where I think understanding science is more ""magical"" than any religious explanation for things, but man, why you gotta be a jerk about it? I found a lot of his explanations lacking - though mainly that was due to the lack of illustrations in my copy. I was entirely dissatisfied with his explanation of sleep paralysis - don't be all, ""Alien abductions and other horror stories are from sleep paralysis, where people throughout the ages have all hallucinated the same thing"" without addressing the fact that it's HELLA WEIRD WE ALL HALLUCINATE THE SAME THING. Sleep paralysis is one of the few things that gets me borderline believing in something ""supernatural"" because it's so freaking weird, and after forcing my way through this book and finally getting excited about actually learning something, I was let down pretty bad by his explanation or lack thereof.I also felt the structure of the book didn't hold up: the basic structure is ""Here's a religious belief/myth, here's the truth behind it"", but several times the chapter starts with ""Well, I couldn't find any myths about this, but let me explain it anyway."" Like...why? That's not the point of the book? Do you just want to explain something to hear yourself talk (er...write?)?I feel bad kind of bad because I ultimately agree with the premise of this book, but it was poorly executed, in my opinion. Maybe as a young preteen just discovering atheism, this would be more exciting. But for me, I thoroughly hated reading it."
741,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."

Ego still flares and I bristle. It’s annoying being talked to in this way. Does anyone enjoy the tone of this book? Could we not just agree that the human brain is at face value a beautiful thing? Dismissing the intelligence of your reader is tantamount to reducing their intelligence by refusing to give them opportunity to be intelligent. This book is full of weird sentences, statements that are tantamount to insulting your intelligence, etc. “They depend for their existence on” * “It May not be that all of these people are charlatans, it may be that some of them really believe they are talking to the dead” “Gene pools are not liquid. So what are they?” Really??? “Tectonic plates are not like the kind you eat off”. This book must be geared towards a 10 year old? There’s nothing in this you wouldn’t know if you had graduated high school. Nothing goes beyond basic science. Everything is glib. Everything leaves important details out. It’s difficult to respect this in any sense at all for an adult audience. However, I could see it being an excellent resource for children, it’s fast, poppy, fun, and over simplified to the point where you might have to add some additional information, but only for an interested reader or listener.

The author found a fascinating way to guide us through the origin of the universe, it's expansion and how all the natural phenomenons are occurring around us. In short, he tried to enrich and enhance our perception of reality by making us understand the underlying mechanism, and considering the general base of readers, he should be successful. To gain a simplistic yet firm understanding of our perceived reality, how it has affected our culturally diverse mindset throughout time, this book is a gem. But what amazes me most is that this book instills a sense of gratitude. It reminds us how insignificant we are in this universe yet how lucky we are to be a part of this majestic existence."

It certainly is not really for those with a background in science or engineering. Ironically, those are the type of folks who would be most interested in reading a book by Dawkins... and they are quite likely to already be well-versed in the basic biology/geology/astronomy that Dawkins presents. The myths are kind of fun, but I'm not convinced they added much. One thing I do enjoy about reading Dawkins is that he does come up with different sorts of metaphors/analogies to explain concepts than are generally presented in classroom/textbook settings and often re-words and re-reasons things in a way that can help me understand them more fully. Alas, this book did not contain much material of that nature."

This does not mean that an adult will find the book boring. On the contrary, the clear and concise writing makes it a refreshing read.The book essentially is a set of twelve questions and their scientific answers. Dawkins begins the answer to every question by describing the ancient myths (which are very funny BTW) that were made up in an attempt to answer the questions. He then goes on and explains the actual answer as given by science. Essentially, he goes on to show that the scientific truths, once understood, are more magical than any supernatural answer."

The purpose of myths is talking in a metaphorical and poetic way. Trying 'understand' reality by being very literally saying that myths are wrong or reality or saying that you have the ultimate truth thanks to science is being completely unscientific and arrogant. Real scientific people are as curious, religious and love metaphors because life and the world Can't really be explained.Coming from the engineering world I still learned a few things about optics and science, not more than that."

Great for highschoolers looking to familiarise themselves with basic concepts; if you're one, go for it!The comparison between modes of explaining (naive/folk vs science) lacks depth (Dawkins merely notes that it is interesting how easily the former prevail); I was also hoping to hear Dawkins's own experiences in transcendental/exhilarating thoughts arising from nonmagical thinking (Dawkins does praise the mind-expansion of discovering the electromagnetic spectrum.)"

749,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17746529-mehedi-sarwar,5,"Nicely written book with several examples. It describes well how the myths are created through different cultures and scriptures when mankind was more busy with survival than scientific exploration of any kind. Many myths would not have created if proper science was already there. Most of the supernatural phenomena we hear about, we hear from our parents, they heard from their parents and so on. Science has already disproved many of them. One of the good takeaway from this book is, if something cannot be explained we do not have to assume that it happened super-naturally or by command of some God, rather we should tell to ourselves that we do know the answer yet, that is the answer is ""X"" , the big unknown. Actually, ""X"" the Unknown should be the default answer to any question until we know the answer. The audio book narration was great. "

761,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10633326-ida,4,"In The magic of reality, Dawkins gives a short introduction to a selection of wide ranging concepts, like evolution and extraterrestrial life. I thought the explanations were very well done. Even though many of the topics touched on comes with an extensive set of alienating terminology, Dawkins generally sticks to straightforward language. Sometimes I felt he tried too hard to pit myhts and superstition against modern science. The sentiment was fine and he was respectful, I just found the angle tireing after a while. It felt a bit out of place considering the demographic.Anyone already interested in science, will probably be familiar with most of the concepts in this book. I think the bigger thing to take away from it is the merits of critical thinking and the beauty of reality in itself.

I could see how a 10-12 year old would really like it, and it's a great refresher for adults too. If only I had absorbed as much when I learned this stuff the first time.Perhaps more interesting is Dawkins's use of myths to introduce each chapter and provide a contrast to reality. It's clear that Dawkins, a noted atheist, has a point to make here. It's actually kind of funny/bizarre to read sentences like ""A Jewish legend tells how two cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, were destroyed by the Hebrew god because the people who lived there were so wicked,"" when you grew up hearing these stories told as if they were fact and as if God were ""God"" and not just one of many. I get what he's trying to do, but the approach still left me a bit cold even though I am no longer religious. While its obviously no longer reasonable to believe these myths as literal explanations of the physical world, Dawkins neglects their emotional heft and I found his attitude a bit flip."

Still worth the read if you liked his other books but just not as ground breaking as some of his others books.
767,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7032663-eric-wojciechowski,5,"If you don't know much about the nature of things; such as, that the Earth goes around the sun (an astonishing third of United States populace think the reverse), don't know that the Earth is four-and-a-half-billion-years-old (some still say six-thousand) or that all creatures on Earth are related to a common ancestor rather than poofing into existence, exactly as we are today, then this is the book for you. If you think “luck” has anything to do with outcomes, or if miracles occur, this is an excellent book to start with. Written for novices on such subject matters, and young adults, Richard Dawkins takes the sum of much of his other work (and that of others) and dials it down to fit a wider audience. This is an excellent and accessible collection of answers to origins, what things are made of (atoms), why do Earthquakes happen, what is the sun, etc. And while I consider myself to be knowledgeable in these areas (enough to get by, anyhow), I considered this work a nice refresher and worth the read.What I like about Mr. Dawkins is his ability to communicate these subjects on par with Carl Sagan. A scientist who can remove the equations and give us the facts, complete with examples and models (while the equations are there for further study if you wish). Mr. Dawkins also writes like he speaks. I'm rather certain he follows the writing rule to read out loud what you write. Does it sound good? If not, then re-write it. I can hear his voice as I'm reading this work, complete with British accent. What I enjoyed most was the subject of who was the first person. Probably because my five-year-old-daughter has been asking this one. The thought experiment given by Mr. Dawkins of taking a picture of yourself, then laying your father's picture on top, then grandfather, then great-grandfather and so on, (having to eventually imagine pictures of great-great-greats for lack of photos), the line up of photographs would be forty-miles long and total 185 million greats (or grancestors) to get back to when your ancestor was something of a fish. You could walk along this forty-mile length of pictures, pulling out groups here and there and see that pictures near each other would look alike, but pictures, say at the five-mile mark would be a completely different species than at the fifteen-mile mark. There was no first person. Little changes grow to big changes but lots of time is needed. It's the nature of the beast, if you will.And to understand this concept further, Mr. Dawkins shows us how language changes. Groups of people wander away from each other, both with the same language and dialect. But over time, words are added, dropped, changed in both groups. If enough time goes by, if the two should meet again, they wouldn't understand each other. Or maybe they would but it would be difficult. I'm personally thinking of how hard a time I have reading Shakespeare. Surely it's English but an English I'm not familiar with.In the age of Wikipedia, answers can be obtained quickly. So if you come away from this work wanting to know more, it's readily accessible. If you're new to these subjects or like a quick refresher on them, I recommend the Magic of Reality. Especially if you have young kids who need the answers, who ask these questions about firsts. Because that's when humans ask the most of them and, in my opinion, need correct answers. Because fixing bad answers is harder the longer a child retains them."

Sanity must be preserved: The book breaks down complex scientific truths more manageably, but, you know, brain hurt happens.The book’s written for a younger crowd, and I believe Dawkins wanted this to stand alongside [if not in place of] storybooks on myth-making heroes and fairytales. And, sure, bibles and their parables. But the grumpy atheist we’ve come to know in Dawkins is muted. He’s just this midly-peeved, impatient, and ultimately dismissive aura hovering over all the science-yum. (I’ve noticed, though, an awkwardness to the voice—but perhaps I’ve read him when he’s let loose, when he doesn’t need to temper?)The focus is on Science and its many wonders, even though, yes, the argument for each chapter is grounded on dismantling myth and religion. [No, silly, some blonde sun-god does not pull a chariot across the sky—the earth revolves on its axis!] Myth, Dawkins keeps repeating, came to be in the days of yore because of an ignorance not through our own fault. We weren’t capable then of the best answers to our questions, not yet. But to continue believing in these myths [i.e., religion]—to accept them as fact, despite the evidence that science offers—despite science assiduously, even gleefully, searching for the answers—just makes one a dodo. (That’s the Dawkins I know.)Dawkins wants me to raise a skeptical child—yes, I’d like to keep this in my shelves, within easy reach of some little monster, eventually. A child who believes in fact, embraces speculations, but relies on logic, evidence, and common sense—without sacrificing an imagination that’s the very foundation of these vast myths he’s dismissively disassembled. A child who’d rather lose himself in the wonder of reality, one ceaselessly amazing because it what is true. (It’s why I like science so much: It assuages your curiosity, and it keeps reminding you how everything makes sense, because the world has rules—serendipity that abounds, the awe-inspiring logic of different grades of intricacy.)Well, at least I hope that’s what he wants. Either way, that’s what I plan to do to little creatures—the gods be willing, and all that jazz. In the meantime, I’m happy to do that myself. [ETA: I admit to rethinking this read-to-a-young’un thing. See, when I was a child, I read this kid's encyclopedia that talked about how the sun would burn itself up, how all life would suffer as a consequence, how everything would subsequently perish. ""In a billion years"" was not a consolation. I carried that knowledge inside me for so long, and I couldn't tell anyone because they were supposed to already know.]A tip: If you’re going to get one for keeps, do find the hardcover copy I have, the one that’s sure to have Dave McKean’s breathtakingly clever illustrations in color. This would have been less of a fun book if it weren’t for the art. Dave McKean, and a science delivered—argued—by Dawkins? Delicious. Just brain-hurty deliciousness."
770,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8795422-william,4,Richard Dawkins is an accomplished scientist with many esteemed publications. He is also a well known apologist for the atheist community. What he has attempted in this book is the debunking of religious explanations for natural phenomenon and the promotion of scientific solutions to those same mysteries. He did an admiral job covering his topic but I must admit I did not feel any magic. He would alternate between a religious or mythological explanation of the big questions of existence then offer sciences take on the subject. In terms of the science he has essentially presented us with an elementary science textbook which covers a wide array of subjects while steering away from the more complicated topics. He makes the mistake of chiding the religious fundamentalist for their views on the sanctity of their beliefs when he doesn't need to. I feel they will fall apart of their own accord. I recommend this book simply because it is written in Dawkins clear and engaging prose. I don't think it will draw too many fundamentalistsu away from the comfort of their beliefs but it does carry on with the triumph of the age of reason.
771,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,3,"Oh, how my 12-year-old self would have been delighted to have this little gem of a science book in her bookcase! With  The Magic of Reality, biologist and writer Richard Dawkins explores the scientific method, the difference between reality and magic, and looks for the answers to some of life’s most imminent questions (“Who was the first person?”, “What are things made of?”, “When and how did everything begin?”, etc.).Each chapter starts off with a main question that needs answering, followed by a mythical story used to explain said question in older times, and then followed up with the actual scientific answer. The tone is light and easy to understand, and it’s a perfect book for curious kids who want to know how the world/the universe works but aren’t ready for adult science books yet. As such, it doesn’t go too deep into scientific theory – not a problem in my opinion, since it’s more than enough for kids and will get that wow-teach-me-more-about-science!-spark burning anyway.Next to finding the scientific answers to a couple of very interesting questions, one of Dawkins’ main points is to distinguish between myth, magic, and make-believe, and the actual reality that can be mapped through scientific experiments. He emphasises critical and sceptical thinking, showing how the scientific method is a much better way of approaching and solving problems than just making up stories about some gods up in the sky. And as always, he also notes that reality itself, uncovered through and by science, is already magical and fantastical enough in and of itself – we don’t even need those mythological stories. Hence, the title.As of now, I doubt anybody is unaware of Dawkins’ stance on religion, and though his dislike of it does seep through a little (foolish humans always using silly stories to explain naturally occurring phenomena when they could be using science!), it isn’t as obvious as usual. Probably because the group this book is aimed towards is a little younger than Dawkins’ standard audience. Anyhow, it didn’t bother me nor did I feel he was making fun of myths in general – all he seemed to be saying was that they provide an outdated view.I’m all for making kids enthusiastic about science, and this book definitely does that. As an adult, it was an enjoyable read for me as well – the light tone and passion of it shine through."
772,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5622607-jukka-s-rkij-rvi,4,"Let me begin by saying that I did not, to my knowledge, read the best edition of the book. The edition I read was a small mass-market paperback, and Dave McKean's doubtlessly beautiful artwork was reduced to smudged greyscale thumbnails that would not have done justice to Martínez's Ecce Homo. It is the only major flaw I can find in the book.The Magic of Reality is written for a pre-teen audience, which is reflected in the language. However, the simple, handholding approach works for an older reader as well, especially in the case of some of the more complex concepts.Here, Dawkins walks the reader through such myriad basic science topics as evolution, genetics, the change of seasons and motion of the planets. Most of the content was already familiar to me, but I am not a scientist, so even there my understanding was deepened. To me, the big thing in the book was the explanation of the function of the spectroscope, redshifting and how the date of the Big Bang was arrived to. Fascinating stuff.Dawkins also displays humility in the occasional admission that this or that thing is outside of his area of expertise and even he does not understand it. Quantum physics springs to mind. However, he commits a significant linguistic gaffe by listing the languages of Romansch, Galician, Occitan and Catalan as dialects, which is linguistically suspect and comes with enough political baggage to choke a horse. Hell, Romansch is an official language in Switzerland, fulfilling even the armey un flot definition. Not much of a flot, admittedly, but it exists.Each chapter of the book opens with a series of mythical tales from around the world, illustrating the history of attempts to explain where we come from, where we're going, or what's that big shiny thing up there in the sky. These are occasionally interesting, but by and large, it is my feeling that Dawkins is at his best when he stays out of the humanities and in the hard sciences, where his expertise lies.All told, The Magic of Reality is a quick, entertaining and educational read. Just get the full-colour edition, because doing this to Dave McKean is a crime against art."
773,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This is one of the few books that I would consider comparing to Asimov's writing, particularly for youth. He explains clearly many things about science. This is NOT a book to read if you are religious or believe in astrology, etc! He completely dismisses religion's ability to actually explain things today. I especially liked one of the final chapters dealing with luck. He explains what the law of averages really mean, and why it is silly to assume someone is a lucky or unlucky person or due to have some good luck after a lot of bad luck. He also talks about the impossibility of miracles using a famous one as example. Did I mention you won't like this book if you are religious? He covers a LOT of basic science. In fact I was thinking that the book could easily be used by a middle grade science teacher as one of the textbooks. Probably not the only textbook since by the general nature of covering quite a few different branches of science, a lot of it is not in depth science. He also gives you a way of evaluating whether something is believable, which would be useful for many of us. He is passionate that not only is science the proper way to view the world, it is also the most beautiful, magical way to view the world. He uses the definition of magic as poetic in the title. If you have youngsters, particularly if you live in a conservative, religious area that is limiting what science can be taught, this book is a must to buy, read and discuss with those youngsters! It may also have the effect of helping kids to realize how fascinating science is and consider taking it up as a career!"
774,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12809503-david-powell,5,"Having read some of the other reviews, I think that some people have the wrong perception of this excellent book. I am not sure that some of the reviewers even got the point of the book. It is not an introduction to science for children no matter how it was advertised. While is is true that the book seems somewhat condescending at times to anyone with some knowledge of science, it is a delineation between what is mythology and what is science (or fact). If one thinks about it, religion happens to be the particular mythology that any given person believes in. For this reason, the crushing challenge that Dawkins brings against religion's explanations for why things are is likely to step upon people's spiritual toes. Every mythology has its roots, in my opinion, in primitive people's need to know about first cause, natural events, and life and death. A simple exercise in imagination can see some primitive people approaching a tribal chief or witchdoctor with exactly those questions, and to extend the image further, the chief or witchdoctor, to maintain his credibility, has to quickly come up with clever, engaging explanations for why we die or why the sun comes up in the morning. My guess it that every mythology began this way. I would bet that Dawkins would agree. You will be, to be sure, reschooled in science, but you will be given a chance to see how silly primitive myths are in today's world. (I read the paperback version which apparently lacks much of the illustration that was discussed in earlier reviews of the hardback version.)"
775,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5923392-diana,5,"Might be my favorite Dawkins book so far. It's certainly the only one I finished in under 24 hrs.I absolutely adored the last 2 chapters about probability and miracles. I laughed out loud in a public place when I got to the lone Scotsman practicing the bagpipes. I have previously read The God Delusion, The Selfish Gene, The Ancestor's Tale, and The Blind Watchmaker, and they had left me thinking that Dawkins' strengths lie in explaining biology and debating political/sociological issues, but that his divergence towards physics or related fields were not as successful. While his biology for example left me fascinated, his explanations of physics concepts are usually understandable but very barren. In this book, however, Dawkins' talks of the prism and the spectroscope for example were simply mesmerizing. Maybe it's because his target audience was younger people so he had to change his tone from explaining-how-things-work to explaining-why-things-are-awesome and you could feel his excitement for these concepts just like his passion for biology is always palpable.Another lovely thing about this book is Dawkins' treatment of the myth sections. While he usually treats mythology and religion as the unfortunate but inevitable product of evolution and sociology, in his book here, he approached them from an anthropological point of view. While maintaining that they are categorically false and poor explanations for reality, he did give them some respect as nice pieces of culture, literature and history."
776,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30594288-arunbalaji-mohanraj,5,"A wonderful book by Richard Dawkins to explain what is the real science behind everything that we believe as magic. This book is all about the myth that we heard from our childhood in different terms and the real science or reasons behind it. I really liked the chapters where he discussed about who was the first person, what are things made of, what is the sun, rainbow and an earthquake. After reading this book, I got questions within myself about our universe and also understood many facts about our universe especially earth and stars from the other sources. I was really shocked to know that it would take thousands of years to reach our nearest star other than the sun. The evolutionary science explained in this book was quite interesting and he takes us through the biological science as the author is an evolutionary biologist on the chapters related to the first person. Also he well illustrated about the existence of life in other planets in the chapter - ""Are we alone."" Author explained each and every chapters with the myths as well as the science and I really enjoyed the science that came after each and every myths. At the beginning of the book, I felt it as quite boring however after few chapters the book was really interesting and I feel like I should read it once again. I would recommend this book for everyone as there are many interesting facts about our universe that we should know for sure."
777,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40677420-hugh-dunnett,4,"An excellent young adult/introductory guide to major themes in science. Dawkins is a superb writer with a talent for describing scientific topics in a way to make them enjoyable and quite comprehensible to all. The areas of science covered are fairly broad in range but specific enough to allow a genuine developing of understanding. Further to this, Dave McKean’s illustrations are frequently breath-taking and genuinely illuminating. This is as much McKean’s book as it is Dawkins’.The novel idea in this introduction to science is to touch on ancient myths and then to speak of the science, the reality behind the myth. This could have added something of a nuanced and unusual flavour to the book. However I felt that the often rather shoehorned inclusion at the start of most chapters of ancient beliefs and myths, often obscure to the point of being well without the everyday readers’ consciousness doesn’t add much to the later revealed ‘magic’ of the scientific reality. Indeed, the only reason I can see for their inclusion is to build up to the final two chapters which have little to do with scientific method but appear to be included primarily to provide a platform to bash believer and belief. This Dawkins has done comprehensively in previous works and which wasn’t really required in this publication. It is a shame as the book would have been quite perfect without it."
778,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54322403-abdulrahman-alhamali,3,"The Magic or Reality by Richard Dawkins is a book that aims to explain the astonishing world around us through the lens of science. It presents several natural phenomena, and compares their scientific and mythical explanations. I enjoyed the book, and learned a lot of interesting facts, especially about biology, the specialty of Dawkins. But I did not enjoy two things: 1- The parts that were not about biology felt very ""reportive"". They just felt as if someone was telling me a lot of information with minimum explanation. 2- The ""reportive"" style of most of the chapters made the book kind of ironic for me; The book tries very hard to pitch the idea of abandoning religious and mythical explanations, but does that in a very ""religious"" way, where the author just presents facts with minimal explanation, and then says: This is what you should believe, not what you read in the religious books.I believe Dawkins could have done a much better job had he tried to write the book in a format that is more interactive and less reportive, or had he focused more on biology, where he most truly shines."
779,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5038234-dylan-armes,4,"After finishing this book, I told my wife we're finally ready to have kids, now that this book is around.Written at a junior high level, this was Richard Dawkins' attempt to write a book of general science that answers a lot of common questions from kids. Questions like ""How do we know how far away things are in space?"" or ""Where did the dinosaurs go?""Love him or hate him, there's no denying that Professor Dawkins is a master of explaining difficult-to-grasp scientific concepts. Though I felt like I understood everything in the book pretty well before going through it, his explanations were all very easy to understand and well-argued.Each chapter of this book begins with some sort of mythology story, from all over the world. Dawkins focuses on how different peoples and different religions answer questions in various supernatural ways, and how now science can give us the answers that people have been searching for all this time. This book is not an attack on religion, like his most famous work: The God Delusion. Rather, it's like his less famous, but overall much better The Selfish Gene, or The Greatest Show on Earth. I recommend this book to everyone over the age of 10. At the VERY LEAST, it will make you think. And you will likely end up with a deeper understanding of fundamental scientific concepts. "
780,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33410234-dan-croft,3,"This book started out well enough; somewhat like The Universe in a Nutshell or similar books about science. I'd say the subject matter discussed is pretty basic for anyone who has a working knowledge of high school and maybe some college level chemistry, biology, physics, etc. Even so, Dawkins has an entertaining and enjoyable writing style, which make it fun to listen, even if it is review. In the beginning of the book Dawkins seem to have a genuine interest in helping the novice person interested in science (but with no background in it) understand some basic precepts. As the book progresses, particularly in the last two chapters, the purpose of the book appears to shift from science education to debunking the supernatural aspects of religion. Dawkins is a well known and outspoken atheist, so it is certainly understandable why he would want to point out his views. However, towards the end he begins to become repetitive, which really grinds down the reader. His points are valid and well taken, but he fails to give any credit to religion as anything more than mythology that should be interpreted literally. The fact that he fails to acknowledge religion as a more abstract philosophy and code of ethics leads the reader to believe that he, not the reader, is the one missing the point. "
781,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237803-m,4,"As one of the reviews on the cover described it, ""A Perfect Introduction to Science"", which it is indeed. Another well-written book by Richard Dawkins, much lighter and simpler than most of his books, mainly targeting more general readers serving to find the magic in truth rather than myths, and to show how reality can be sometimes more entertaining than fiction. For me, there was little new there but I thoroughly enjoyed the way it was written and the calm and patient approach to explaining scientific concepts. Each chapter discussed a scientific topic or phenomenon, it started with listing some of the legends that tried to explain this subject, then slowly discussing the scientific explanation of the phenomenon focusing on the beauty of the truth and how it can be more magical (not in the supernatural sense of the word) than the myths and fantasies created and passed on over generations.This is an essential read to help increase basic science literacy. The light version of science here might appeal to the general reader who finds it difficult to read a science book. The introduction and final chapter can serve as an eye-opener for some readers, though you would normally think that a Richard Dawkins' reader will normally be already familiar with these ideas."
782,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22748104-josh-taylor,2,"I think the pilgrimage Dawkins is on trying to teaching people the illogicality of their ways and show them there is beauty in science is fine, admirable in a way. But people that do not agree with that line of thought are hardly likely to pick up one of Dawkins books. So why preach to the converted? What I found as a scientist was a book filled with common sense explanation.The illogical beliefs/theory’s that people hold that he disproves through explanation, although well explained are trivial and therefore his explanations come across in my opinion as patronizing to the reader. And I would have thought that to be the case for the majority of people who read this book science layman or not. I am not having a go at Dawkins I just think he is out of touch with the times, the Selfish Gene was revolutionary and shocking at the time of its release due to its controversial contents compared to the widely held believes of the populous at the time. Now I feel like he’s trying to do the same thing. I thought this book would highlight the mind bending and amazing things that are happening in modern science such as quantum entanglement stuff that makes you go WOW. Instead it was just a dig at the minority of people that hold certain beliefs. "
783,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48066-chazzle,4,"I really enjoyed this book about general science, and how we know what we know. Although written at a middle school level, interesting observations abound. For example, suppose you look through a telescope at a star that's 100 million light years away. That means you're looking at something that happened 100 million years ago. As such, if you happened to be observing intelligent life looking at us, they would be seeing dinosaurs, not you, in the present moment! Wild! This is an example of the poetic magic of reality, giving the book's title.I happened upon a youtube video with Bill O'Reilly interviewing author Richard Dawkins, while actually trying to find another link recommended by the author in the book itself. And O'Reilly's point is true, IMHO. Indeed, the author does spend a good portion of time dismantling the miracle stories of various religions, including Christianity, in a book marketed to the young. So, if you're a biblical literalist, or prefer that your child not have the miracle accounts in his scripture debunked, this might not be the book for you. As I see it, though, Dawkins' grip on reality is much, much firmer than O'Reilly's."
784,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1784379-jess-cattanach,4,"The Magic of Reality is the first Dawkins book I’ve read, but I feel like it was a good introduction to his works. Relatively short and easily digestible, this book is perfect for a quick read between tasks. Dawkins addresses a number of things that many people have little scientific understanding about, and introduces each chapter in a very nifty fashion: by describing some of the myths people have come up with over the years to describe the phenomena. After this humorous introduction he goes on to explain what actually occurs in a way that is both scientifically sound and understandable, even for those with no science background.I may be a little biased, being a science student and overall science geek, but I really did enjoy this book. Dawkins’ writing style flows together quite nicely and even if you know how one of the processes work he writes it in a way that makes it still engaging to read.Really, I think the thing that makes this book stand out is its wonderful contrast between myth and reality (hence the title!) It very neatly wraps up, too, that everything has a sound explanation, even if we are yet to find out what that explanation is. "
785,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,3,"Standing on its own, I should give this book 5 stars. It is written for an audience that is not science literate and it not only does the job but it actually very enligtening and gives the reader a sense of joy vis-a-vis astronomy and other forms of science.That said, I rated it 3 starts because I'm comparing it to his other books which were so much better. I'm still not sure how this rating system works but I tend not to rate a book on its own merit but to compare it to other books the same author has written - that is, if I've read other books by the same author. So maybe my ""3"" is not altogether fair.Getting back to the book, this one would be a FANTASTIC book assignment for high school students who are taking science classes and are struggling with the Big Questions like, ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" Why is this or that thing bad luck?"" ... you get the idea. Dawkins turns the reader to science and helps her to understand that there are marvelous and surreal experiences to be had aside from subscribing circumstances to superstition."
786,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310403-kyle,3,"A handbook for junior sceptics and parents not wanting their children growing up deluded about gods, myths or magic, Dawkins covers a lot of ground from earliest traces of life on earth to the reason rainbows appear in the sky, plus how the planets and stars maintain their relative position to our rotating/revolving peppercorn. There are a few fields he dares not enter, such as quarks and other subatomic processes, which he leaves out of the book. Most chapters seem as backwards as the title: in attempting to prove the reality of what others would claim to be magic, he gives a passing description of what scientists have observed that are preceded by the wild and occasionally amusing myths from around the world, all of which are assuredly wrong. Wouldn't more children be interested in being talked up to by learning a scientific concept first, and then finding out the amazing variety of stories different cultures have provided to explain the concept without science but with a more alchemical sense of reality?"
787,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17891225-karnika-kapoor,4,"It was interesting to read about the mythological stories from different cultures and eras. I was rather more impressed by ""The God Delusion"" than by ""The magic of reality"". Perhaps, because it was my first Richard Dawkins's book and I was hugely impressed by the argument made there (as the same was in my subconscious all my life). The debunking of myth in this book is something not very new to me. However, it includes bits and peaces of information that I was not aware of and I profoundly enjoyed gaining information about those bits. I specifically liked the part related to ""sleep paralysis"" as I experience the same quite often. Back in my ""Theistic"" days, I use to relate it with supernatural (Guilty as charged). But as I started to think rationally over things, it was not quite logical to follow. I recommend this book to people seeking an empirical evidence against the so-called ""miracle"" of past. A typical Dawkins style approach to encourage people to think rationally. I enjoyed reading it. "
788,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6137539-david-h,0,"Magic Reality is a very good children's book on general science. It is based strictly on evolution and cosmology. It is Richard Dawkins way of fighting what he called The God Delusion in an earlier book. Once this delusion takes hold of the mind, it cannot be removed. So it must not be allowed in at all. Children must never be taught about God or any supernatural creatures except as myths. A child's view of reality must be the child's first view of reality. Because it is new, it will seem magic. Hence the title, The Magic of Reality. Children are natural-born scientists. Any intelligent observer of children at play will see this. They observe, they wonder, they test, they wonder some more...until some stupid adult pulls them away and fills their little heads with Adam and Eve and the snake and the apple. So Dawkins has written a book as much fun as fairy tales, as exciting as pirate stories, and as full of true spirituality as any of the crap they teach in Sunday School."
789,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5731693-jerry-stroh,4,"This children's book by Richard Dawkins & illustrated by Dave McKean (of Sandman fame) is great and I highly recommend it to anyone, even adults, because there is a lot of info here which even I didn't know about science - and I mean general stuff that in an ideal world, nobody with a public school education shouldn't know - and again, like most of Dawkins' books, it makes science interesting. My favorite part was about rainbows. I think every child around 10 should be given this book to read. Right about the time they learn the truth about Santa Claus. You know, when it's the right time to teach children the difference between fiction and reality. So they understand that rainbows are formed by light reflected through falling rain and were not created by 'God' after the myth of Noah and his crowded ark, for example. And other stuff about the reality of evolution and the fiction of the supernatural."
790,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7664274-sarah,3,"I'm in no way a scientific genius. My brain is ruled by myth and magic more than logic and hard facts. That's not to say that I don't adore learning about the world and learning about the reality of the times in which we live. I suppose that's why I was drawn to this book- 'The Magic of Reality'. What a fantastic title! I was also encouraged by the fact that this book was written 'for people of all generations' and yes, it was easy to understand. Dawkins has a remarkable ability to flawlessly simplify really difficult science. I think there's something very appealing about a scientist who can make physics and chemistry appealing and relateable. My only issue was that, at times, it was patronising and holier than thou. I may not be a religious person, but even then I felt that Dawkins took some cheap shots against religious beliefs. Yes yes, we all get it, science and religion are on opposite wavelengths. You don't need to be a jackass about it. "

Listening to it as an audiobook was particularly effective, I think, because you could hear the joy and excitement in the readers' voices (read partially by Dawkins, partially by a woman). Essentially, this book is a review of high school science, but without the irritations, boredom, and hormones. Dawkins shows a genuine love of science and shares his enthusiasm through well-crafted prose that, thought it dives into challenges topics, never felt stuffy or too challenging. I would recommend this as a fantastic book for anyone interested in how the world works, especially as a primer to reading more in-depth works, such as A Short History of Nearly Everything. Additionally, I would recommend this book to any ""baby"" atheist looking for information about how the world works. "

This book is an example of the great scientific interesting vulgarisation. Starting from ""What is reality?"" till ""What is miracle?"", I couldn't predict what author gonna say before I enter into an actual chapter. I guess, there his brilliance challenging us. Sometimes, I wonder how can he touch so easily those sensitive topics , commenting on it and cleverly driving us to believe in it etc. Magic Vs Reality, Gods,Myth Vs Sceince , DNA Evolution, Dromerdeener, gene pool etc He is answering for all crazy questions in an intelligent funny acceptable way... haha... Simply I love his writing. I enjoyed each and every line of this book.

And, it's not an attack on religion as it is, but as the author imagines it to be. In the author's misunderstood view, religion is merely and solely a poor man's science, whose purpose was just to describe the cosmos mythologically, when we didn't know any better--and we should be done with religion by now. To the contrary, religion is about developing spiritual strength, to prepare oneself for the moments of moral crisis in life. Without that strength, we lack the needed grace, fall from the path, and suffer. The author doesn't know this, as he hasn't bothered to find out. Instead, he relies on his preconceived, wrong notions of religion. And writes about religion without understanding what it's about. The author's approach to writing about religion is the reverse of scientific. It's dogmatic."

This book is a kind of ""Cliff Notes"" on most elementary, and important, scientific topics like natural evolution, Newtonian/Copernicus astronomy, the nature of atoms etc. There is not much to be learnt for anyone who has gone through the high school science courses without sleeping. The author's objectives are different (or same if you have read him before): to debunk the non-scientific, particularly religious notions of how we came in to being. So while the book brings little that would be new to seasoned readers (of almost any kind), the way the book is put together makes it an easy read with many interesting myths, anecdotes and language twists to describe some scientific concepts. The book is more useful for teens and/or people at impressionable ages."
795,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5356398-shahad-abdullah,4,"I really enjoyed this book, it is well written and very clear in its explanations. Another reason I liked it tremendously is that I had my first audio book experience with it; where Dawkins reads through all the chapters with his wife. Although some information presented was basic and sometimes critical of beliefs and religious thoughts, the way it was illustrated was fascinating as each chapter starts with a myth and then is explained scientifically. Questions like ""What is an earthquake?"" and "" What is the sun?"" are answered. This book is quite suitable for all ages, and it really evokes wonderment in you. I particularly loved how he explained magic in the first chapter, and how the most beauty lies in the poetic-and real sense of the world. It is true, the magic of unraveling a mystery and the road to discovery is indeed, beautiful."

People who are about age 12 and above can read this book. The type of the book is non-fiction, science, true stories, legends, theories and thoughts. I’ve chosen this book because my friend told me to read it. There are 12 chapters in it, each chapter has real question like what is rainbow? What’s the sun? Etc. Moreover, Richard answers to those questions logically and realistic it’s kind of magic if you imagine and think about it. I really enjoy reading it and the best part was in the first chapter, its talk about biology and I really love anything about biology. Also the writer talks about the scientist. Richard impressed me so I did a search for him and I found that he’s an English ethnologist and evolutionary biologist. "
797,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13514620-matilda-rose,3,"Each chapter in this book explains the question in the title of that chapter. The first chapter explains what magic is. According to Richard Dawkins, there are three different types of magic - supernatural magic, stage magic, and poetic magic. Supernatural magic is something not scientifically possible, something that only happens in fairytales. Stage magic is an illusion to make you think what you’re seeing is magic, but it’s really all just a complex trick.The book ends with ‘What is a miracle?’, in which Dawkins talks about how to decide what a miracle is. Decide the possible explanations and select the most likely. It’s probably just a coincidence. Some coincidences can become what seems a miracle by exaggerated re-tellings.I thought this book was okay. It was written well, and a few of the things I was interested in, but as far non-fiction books go, it was good!"

Enlightening new knowledge that gives one a new vision of nature.MEDIUM At the cover of this book’s edition there’s a short summary by Ricky Gervais which says essentially that this book makes you smarter. I could not agree more. Reading this book will most likely fill some knowledge gap for you that you weren’t aware of. It sure did for me. Chapters often start with old - and not so old - myths and religious stories regarding topics of reality life. These stories are then contrasted with science’s explanations to the same phenomena. Such a structure displays the superior strength of science over non-evidence based beliefs. Dawkins guides us delightfully through the realms of biology, astronomy, physics, ethics, and many more. Without a doubt this book will enlighten you in some way or another, it will make you wonder and observe things in nature differently. I profoundly enjoyed the trip.LONGESTImagine you are assigned with the task of explaining to your young teenager cousin the origin of biology as we know and live it. You will have to mention how diverse life on Earth is, even beyond science’s reach. And how it’s organized - sometimes fuzzily - in different kingdoms: plants, animals, microscopic life… How can one tackle such an assignment?One reasonable option is to opt for a reductionist - macro to micro - approach. We start off with a complex being such as an elephant, then “simplify” down to a fly that probably flies around it. From here we can focus on the uni-neuronal worm crawling around the same scene, then the grass our elephant is stepping on until the point we include a simple bacteria floating in the pond on the ground. You know these beings - and all the rest on the planet including us humans - are all related, part of their DNA is shared. They all derive from the same ancestor - millions of years ago. But how can you explain their relationship? One word: evolution. Evolution must certainly be part of your explanation then, it links all these seemingly unrelated beings together.You may be asked this question, understandably: how can we know what happened millions of years ago? The answer is that scientists infer it from fossils and geological layers. Fossils are preserved instances of past living creatures that often no longer exist at the same evolutionary step. So they don’t exist but yet they are real? Precisely, reality is not just what we see or know, it’s also what used to exist in one shape or another. How can we understand things that don’t exist and don’t have access to? By using models. Building models allows scientists to fill the gaps missing in the knowledge puzzle. As new evidence appears those models are refined, rebuilt or many times completely rejected. This is the basis of the scientific method. Clearly core concepts such as models, fossils, the role of geology and the scientific method must be included in your explanation.Eventually the reductionist approach will reach the atom, and inevitably the diversity of atoms (N, H, O, Fe). Atoms are what physical matter is made of, and atoms themselves are made up of neutrons, electrons, and positrons, but let’s stop the reductionist trip here.Where did all this matter come from? Well matter essentially derived from old stars in space that collapsed and left orbiting stardust trails. They in turn collapsed into other stardust clouds forming bigger chunks, and so on until those chunks were big as a planet. Mix this with the irradiating energy from active stars - such as our Sun - and gravity forces, and you “cook” the current planet we now live in.That energy irradiated from the Sun is in the form of electromagnetic waves spanning a very broad spectrum of frequencies. And indeed part of these waves are the reason we see things, name the visible light part of the spectrum. We know all this thanks in big part to Newton’s experiments with light. So clearly you can’t miss mentioning him and his experiments with light in your explanation.But the universe is not just stars, Earth’s biology, other planets and energy. There might quite likely be extra-terrestrial creatures inhabiting some part of the universe. Aliens are absolutely a serious and very scientific wonder, it’s one you can’t avoid talking about in your assignment. Everyone is somewhat curious about extra-terrestrial life.Now let’s go back to Earth and all its good things and bad things. From an Earthling’s perspective phenomena like wars and diseases are undoubtedly bad and undesirable. But what if we look at it from a cosmic point of view? It really doesn’t make the universe better or worse, it’s just part of a process.Luckily science has gone a long way, and many of our questions have reasonable answers nowadays. Our human ancestors weren’t so lucky. They observed the world with awe, wondering about things we are certain nowadays thanks to science. Their technology wasn’t as advanced then, so many of their knowledge gaps were filled with inventions such as myths and religious stories. Which along generations derived in the current religious beliefs present in human societies.In summary, you’ve been assigned an herculean task. One cannot easily explain all these topics and link them together in a clear and interesting manner. You would need extraordinary didactic and synthetic abilities. Not mentioning of course a clear and accessible language and solid understanding of most of science’s branches.While you could go and try to accomplish such a task yourself, I would rather recommend you to read “Magic of Reality” instead. It geniusly explains all these topics and many more perfectly. Additionally it does so in an absolutely captivating way. You probably would not accomplish this task better than Dawkins, I certainly would not."

Dawkins is incredibly talented at explaining very complex things and his writing is not boring or nap-inducing at all. LOVE! the artwork is also top-notch and really helped clarify some of the more abstract ideas in this book. The Magic of Reality really puts all other science text books to shame. "
800,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6974559-jo-jo,4,"This book lets us realize how ridiculous myths are and why they are written. By giving one or two mythical explanations then the more complicated and more sensible. My favorite chapter was the last one where if something unusual happend not to rule out the possibility of magic but to see what was the most likely explanation was. This an example from the book. A dealer deals out a pack of 52 playing cards to four men and every one gets all the same suit here are three explanations1. The dealer has used magic2. It is pure chance ( the odds against this are 536,447,737,765,488,792,839,237,440,000 to 1)3. The dealer has arranged the cards I think 3 probably happend.

Nonetheless, Dawkins is a great teacher and does not necessarily talk down to his readers; I found the tone just fine contrary to some complaints. Dawkin just wanted the book to be accessible to all, including teenegers and slows like me :). The book answers (eloquently) all questions that 'you were afraid to ask but wanted to (really) know' such as; who was the first person, when did the universe began, is rainbow as simple as it's described, what is the sun---how it came about....e.t.cI liked how he started by describing myths involved in each question and the way he progressed towards the real magic; the magic of here and now. It's a perfect five!"

But lo' n' behold, in an overcrowded airport book shop, it managed to creep into my possession nonetheless. I should have stayed with my initial assesment.It's not really a bad book. It's superbly written for 10-12 year olds. My biggest problem was the condescending tone of the narrative and the fact that I did not learn a single new fact, if you disregard a few myths I hadn't encountered before. It's just a rehash - tremendously simplified - of things I've been over many times before. Buy it for your children, nephews or nieces. If you're the least bit scientifically inclined, you do not need to read it for yourself."
803,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30877314-francis-chin,4,"The best way to review this fascinating book is to give you an excerpt where Dawkins asks whether we have ever been sexually assaulted by demons, abducted by aliens or attacked by vampires. To many folks who said yes, their experience was real as far as they are concerned. But does it mean demons and vampires exist?Here’s the explanation by scientist Richard Dawkins in his book, The Magic of Reality – how we know what’s really true (2011):FALSE memory syndrome helps us understand why at least some of the people who think they have been abducted by aliens claim to have such vivid memories of the incident. What usually happens is that a person becomes obsessed with aliens through reading stories in the newspapers about other alleged abductions. Often, these people are fans of Star Trek or other science fiction tales. It is a striking fact that the aliens they think they’ve met usually look very like the ones portrayed in the most recent television fiction about aliens, and they usually do the same kind of ""experiments"" as have recently been seen on television.The next thing that may happen is that the person is afflicted by a frightening experience called sleep paralysis. It is not uncommon.You may even have experienced it yourself, in which case I hope it will be a bit less scary the next time it happens if I explain it to you now.Normally, when you are asleep and dreaming, your body is paralysed. I supposed it’s to stop your muscles working in tune with your dreams and making you sleepwalk (though this does, of course, sometimes happen). And normally, when you wake and your dream vanishes, the paralysis goes and you can move your muscles.But occasionally there is a delay between your mind returning to consciousness and your muscles coming back to life, and that is called sleep paralysis. It is frightening, as you can imagine. You are sort of awake, and you can see your bedroom and everything in it, but you can’t move. Sleep paralysis is often accompanied by terrifying hallucinations. People feel surrounded by a sense of dreadful danger, which they can’t put a name to. Sometimes they even see things that are not there, just as in a dream. And, also as in a dream, to the dreamer they seem absolutely real. Now, if you are going to have a hallucination when you suffer sleep paralysis, what might that hallucination look like? A modern science fiction fan might well see little grey men with big heads and wraparound eyes. In earlier centuries, before science fiction came along, the visions people saw were different: hobgoblins, perhaps, or werewolves; bloodsucking vampires or (if they were lucky) beautiful winged angels.The point is that the images people see when experiencing sleep paralysis are not really there but are conjured up in the mind from past fears, legends or fiction. Even if they don’t hallucinate, the experience is so frightening that, when they finally wake up, sleep paralysis victims often believe that something horrible has happened to them. If you are primed to believe in vampires, you might wake with a strong belief that a bloodsucker has attacked you. If I am primed to believe in alien abductions I might wake up believing that I was abducted and my memory then wiped clean by aliens.The next thing that typically happens to sleep paralysis victims is that, even if they didn’t actually hallucinate aliens and gruesome experiments at the time, their fearful reconstruction of what they suspect may have happened becomes consolidated as a false memory. This process is often helped along by friends and family, who eagerly pump them for more and more detailed accounts of what happened, and even prompt them with leading questions: “Were there aliens there? What colour were they? Were they grey? Did they have big wraparound eyes like in the movies?”Even questions can be enough to implant or cement a false memory. When you look at it like this, it is not so surprising that a 1992 poll concluded that nearly four million Americans thought they had been abducted by aliens.Psychologist Sue Blackmore points out that sleep paralysis was the most likely cause of earlier imagined horrors, too, before the idea of space aliens became popular. In medieval times people claimed to have been visited in the middle of the night by an ‘incubus’ (a male demon visiting a female victim to have sex with her) or ‘succubus’ (a female demon visiting a male victim to have sex with him). One of the effects of sleep paralysis is that, if you try to move, it feels as though something is pressing down on your body. This could easily be interpreted by the terrified victim as a sexual assault.Legend in Newfoundland talks of an Old Hag who visits people in the night and presses down on their chests. And there is a legend in Indochina of a Grey Ghost who visits people in the dark and paralyses them.So we have a good understanding of why people believe they have been abducted by aliens, and we can tie the modern myths of alien abduction in with earlier myths of rapacious incubi and succubi, or of vampires with long canine teeth who visit in the night and suck our blood. There is no good evidence at all that this planet has ever been visited by aliens from outer space (or, for that matter, by incubi or succubi or demons of any kind). But we are still left with the question of whether there actually are living things on other planets. Just because they haven’t visited us it doesn’t mean they don’t exist. Could the same process of evolution, or even a very different process that perhaps resembles our kind of evolution only slightly, have got going on other planets as well as ours?End of excerptBy the way, read Hallucinations by Dr Oliver Sacks (2012), for a detailed description of how an individual (including Dr Sacks himself) sees and interacts with things, humans and other creatures created inside their mind. As far as the individual is concerned, everything before his or her eyes is real and solid. Dr Sacks mentions that one Sunday morning, two friends Jim and Katy, dropped by his house. He went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast for them. Here's Dr Sacks account: ""Then, five minutes later, I shouted, 'Everything's ready,' put their ham and eggs on a tray, walked into the living room—and found it empty. No Jim, no Kathy, no sign that they had ever been there. I was so staggered I almost dropped the tray. It had not occurred to me for an instant that Jim and Kathy's voices, their 'presences', were unreal, hallucinatory. We had had a friendly, ordinary conversation, just as we usually had.Their voices were the same as always—there was no hint, until I opened the swinging doors and found the living room empty, that the whole conversation, at least their side of it, had been invented by my brain.PS. In my own edition of Dawkin's book, there were some fabulous illustrations including the scary one of a demon squatting on a sleeping woman. It's a pity this web site doesn't have a section to display images. Message me if you want to see the sleep demon!"
804,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,5,"Ricky Gervais says of The Magic of Reality: “I wanted to write this book but I wasn’t clever enough. Now I’ve read it, I am.” I've found that Dawkins gets more readable the more he writes. Simpler than Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" (simpler, of course, because this was written for children and young adults, but I venture to say that a considerable percentage of the American voting population could learn something from this book), Dawkins does a wonderful job addressing myths and reality in a rational, non-confrontational way - atypical for the Dawkins of late...the non-confrontational, that is.Recommended. Even for adults. Especially for children."
805,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"A wonderful & ""magical"" book! Clearly intended (also) for younger readers, Richard Dawkins explains elemantary facts and phenomena of life (rainbows, earthquakes, evolution etc) in his clearly unique way. And by doing so he reveals how magical our world as experienced thanks to and through science already is - without tales of magic, miracles and other nonsense.Unfortunately, neither my Kindle edition nor the paperback version are as beautifully illustrated as the hardcover apparently is (except for the small illustrations at the beginning of each chapter). But I bought the book because of Dawkins and the science facts so it's not really a downer."
806,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5814532-jim,4,"What a fascinating book. I realize this is written at a rather primary level, but there's so much here that was just never covered when I was going through school that it almost seemed new to me. The beauty of science. The magic of reality. Dawkins does a great job in showing us how amazing nature is. Of course, there's the requisite, constant reminder that all and every religion is completely and crazily untrue, and that gets pretty old. But the real stuff - the science - is just plain cool. Very enjoyable read. Of course, Dave McKean's illustrations merely serve to make the book that much better. Recommended. "
807,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"Once again, I found Richard Dawkins a Pleasure to read. In this book, he illustrates a number of areas in science. On each topic, he gives some of the various myths on the topic at hand; then he presents the science behind it. Science wins out. Dawkins just has the knack of explanation—keeping it fresh and interesting. One example is, the red shift of the galaxies as evidence for the big bang. It is explained that the spectrum of the light shows the the same patterns, but they are shift to the red. I read about this numerous times. This is the first time I caught on to how scientist can tell that the light is shifted. For Dawkins fans or not, I can recommend this book."
808,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164533-lilit,5,"The book is meant for younger audience as it provides very basic, yet coherent, very structured and still exciting, information on the subjects discussed. Moreover, the style of starting every chapter with myths followed by the scientific evidence is rather impactful. The book challenges your mind in terms of prompting you to think what are all the other myths that we have accepted as reality and seldom think whether they REALLY are TRUE. It is not a dull science book! I was impressed by how well Dawkins managed to trigger my imagination to clearly picture all the things described in his book. "
809,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6820027-peter-cawdron,5,"I'm reading this with my kids at night on the iPad, which is an excellent medium, as it has the entire book plus beautiful illustrations and a number of interactive features, like breeding frogs over successive generations to see if they can survive predation by snakes. The kids loved experimenting with that, seeing how the concept of selection works first hand. This is a book you'll love reading with your kids, and is suitable for children from 8-14 (plus there's plenty for us old farts to learn too)"
810,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33410234-dan-croft,3,"This book started out well enough; somewhat like The Universe in a Nutshell or similar books about science. I'd say the subject matter discussed is pretty basic for anyone who has a working knowledge of high school and maybe some college level chemistry, biology, physics, etc. Even so, Dawkins has an entertaining and enjoyable writing style, which make it fun to listen, even if it is review. In the beginning of the book Dawkins seem to have a genuine interest in helping the novice person interested in science (but with no background in it) understand some basic precepts. As the book progresses, particularly in the last two chapters, the purpose of the book appears to shift from science education to debunking the supernatural aspects of religion. Dawkins is a well known and outspoken atheist, so it is certainly understandable why he would want to point out his views. However, towards the end he begins to become repetitive, which really grinds down the reader. His points are valid and well taken, but he fails to give any credit to religion as anything more than mythology that should be interpreted literally. The fact that he fails to acknowledge religion as a more abstract philosophy and code of ethics leads the reader to believe that he, not the reader, is the one missing the point. "
811,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237803-m,4,"As one of the reviews on the cover described it, ""A Perfect Introduction to Science"", which it is indeed. Another well-written book by Richard Dawkins, much lighter and simpler than most of his books, mainly targeting more general readers serving to find the magic in truth rather than myths, and to show how reality can be sometimes more entertaining than fiction. For me, there was little new there but I thoroughly enjoyed the way it was written and the calm and patient approach to explaining scientific concepts. Each chapter discussed a scientific topic or phenomenon, it started with listing some of the legends that tried to explain this subject, then slowly discussing the scientific explanation of the phenomenon focusing on the beauty of the truth and how it can be more magical (not in the supernatural sense of the word) than the myths and fantasies created and passed on over generations.This is an essential read to help increase basic science literacy. The light version of science here might appeal to the general reader who finds it difficult to read a science book. The introduction and final chapter can serve as an eye-opener for some readers, though you would normally think that a Richard Dawkins' reader will normally be already familiar with these ideas."
812,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22748104-josh-taylor,2,"I think the pilgrimage Dawkins is on trying to teaching people the illogicality of their ways and show them there is beauty in science is fine, admirable in a way. But people that do not agree with that line of thought are hardly likely to pick up one of Dawkins books. So why preach to the converted? What I found as a scientist was a book filled with common sense explanation.The illogical beliefs/theory’s that people hold that he disproves through explanation, although well explained are trivial and therefore his explanations come across in my opinion as patronizing to the reader. And I would have thought that to be the case for the majority of people who read this book science layman or not. I am not having a go at Dawkins I just think he is out of touch with the times, the Selfish Gene was revolutionary and shocking at the time of its release due to its controversial contents compared to the widely held believes of the populous at the time. Now I feel like he’s trying to do the same thing. I thought this book would highlight the mind bending and amazing things that are happening in modern science such as quantum entanglement stuff that makes you go WOW. Instead it was just a dig at the minority of people that hold certain beliefs. "
813,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48066-chazzle,4,"I really enjoyed this book about general science, and how we know what we know. Although written at a middle school level, interesting observations abound. For example, suppose you look through a telescope at a star that's 100 million light years away. That means you're looking at something that happened 100 million years ago. As such, if you happened to be observing intelligent life looking at us, they would be seeing dinosaurs, not you, in the present moment! Wild! This is an example of the poetic magic of reality, giving the book's title.I happened upon a youtube video with Bill O'Reilly interviewing author Richard Dawkins, while actually trying to find another link recommended by the author in the book itself. And O'Reilly's point is true, IMHO. Indeed, the author does spend a good portion of time dismantling the miracle stories of various religions, including Christianity, in a book marketed to the young. So, if you're a biblical literalist, or prefer that your child not have the miracle accounts in his scripture debunked, this might not be the book for you. As I see it, though, Dawkins' grip on reality is much, much firmer than O'Reilly's."
814,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1784379-jess-cattanach,4,"The Magic of Reality is the first Dawkins book I’ve read, but I feel like it was a good introduction to his works. Relatively short and easily digestible, this book is perfect for a quick read between tasks. Dawkins addresses a number of things that many people have little scientific understanding about, and introduces each chapter in a very nifty fashion: by describing some of the myths people have come up with over the years to describe the phenomena. After this humorous introduction he goes on to explain what actually occurs in a way that is both scientifically sound and understandable, even for those with no science background.I may be a little biased, being a science student and overall science geek, but I really did enjoy this book. Dawkins’ writing style flows together quite nicely and even if you know how one of the processes work he writes it in a way that makes it still engaging to read.Really, I think the thing that makes this book stand out is its wonderful contrast between myth and reality (hence the title!) It very neatly wraps up, too, that everything has a sound explanation, even if we are yet to find out what that explanation is. "
815,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,3,"Standing on its own, I should give this book 5 stars. It is written for an audience that is not science literate and it not only does the job but it actually very enligtening and gives the reader a sense of joy vis-a-vis astronomy and other forms of science.That said, I rated it 3 starts because I'm comparing it to his other books which were so much better. I'm still not sure how this rating system works but I tend not to rate a book on its own merit but to compare it to other books the same author has written - that is, if I've read other books by the same author. So maybe my ""3"" is not altogether fair.Getting back to the book, this one would be a FANTASTIC book assignment for high school students who are taking science classes and are struggling with the Big Questions like, ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" Why is this or that thing bad luck?"" ... you get the idea. Dawkins turns the reader to science and helps her to understand that there are marvelous and surreal experiences to be had aside from subscribing circumstances to superstition."
816,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310403-kyle,3,"A handbook for junior sceptics and parents not wanting their children growing up deluded about gods, myths or magic, Dawkins covers a lot of ground from earliest traces of life on earth to the reason rainbows appear in the sky, plus how the planets and stars maintain their relative position to our rotating/revolving peppercorn. There are a few fields he dares not enter, such as quarks and other subatomic processes, which he leaves out of the book. Most chapters seem as backwards as the title: in attempting to prove the reality of what others would claim to be magic, he gives a passing description of what scientists have observed that are preceded by the wild and occasionally amusing myths from around the world, all of which are assuredly wrong. Wouldn't more children be interested in being talked up to by learning a scientific concept first, and then finding out the amazing variety of stories different cultures have provided to explain the concept without science but with a more alchemical sense of reality?"
817,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17891225-karnika-kapoor,4,"It was interesting to read about the mythological stories from different cultures and eras. I was rather more impressed by ""The God Delusion"" than by ""The magic of reality"". Perhaps, because it was my first Richard Dawkins's book and I was hugely impressed by the argument made there (as the same was in my subconscious all my life). The debunking of myth in this book is something not very new to me. However, it includes bits and peaces of information that I was not aware of and I profoundly enjoyed gaining information about those bits. I specifically liked the part related to ""sleep paralysis"" as I experience the same quite often. Back in my ""Theistic"" days, I use to relate it with supernatural (Guilty as charged). But as I started to think rationally over things, it was not quite logical to follow. I recommend this book to people seeking an empirical evidence against the so-called ""miracle"" of past. A typical Dawkins style approach to encourage people to think rationally. I enjoyed reading it. "
818,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6137539-david-h,0,"Magic Reality is a very good children's book on general science. It is based strictly on evolution and cosmology. It is Richard Dawkins way of fighting what he called The God Delusion in an earlier book. Once this delusion takes hold of the mind, it cannot be removed. So it must not be allowed in at all. Children must never be taught about God or any supernatural creatures except as myths. A child's view of reality must be the child's first view of reality. Because it is new, it will seem magic. Hence the title, The Magic of Reality. Children are natural-born scientists. Any intelligent observer of children at play will see this. They observe, they wonder, they test, they wonder some more...until some stupid adult pulls them away and fills their little heads with Adam and Eve and the snake and the apple. So Dawkins has written a book as much fun as fairy tales, as exciting as pirate stories, and as full of true spirituality as any of the crap they teach in Sunday School."
819,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5731693-jerry-stroh,4,"This children's book by Richard Dawkins & illustrated by Dave McKean (of Sandman fame) is great and I highly recommend it to anyone, even adults, because there is a lot of info here which even I didn't know about science - and I mean general stuff that in an ideal world, nobody with a public school education shouldn't know - and again, like most of Dawkins' books, it makes science interesting. My favorite part was about rainbows. I think every child around 10 should be given this book to read. Right about the time they learn the truth about Santa Claus. You know, when it's the right time to teach children the difference between fiction and reality. So they understand that rainbows are formed by light reflected through falling rain and were not created by 'God' after the myth of Noah and his crowded ark, for example. And other stuff about the reality of evolution and the fiction of the supernatural."
820,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7664274-sarah,3,"I'm in no way a scientific genius. My brain is ruled by myth and magic more than logic and hard facts. That's not to say that I don't adore learning about the world and learning about the reality of the times in which we live. I suppose that's why I was drawn to this book- 'The Magic of Reality'. What a fantastic title! I was also encouraged by the fact that this book was written 'for people of all generations' and yes, it was easy to understand. Dawkins has a remarkable ability to flawlessly simplify really difficult science. I think there's something very appealing about a scientist who can make physics and chemistry appealing and relateable. My only issue was that, at times, it was patronising and holier than thou. I may not be a religious person, but even then I felt that Dawkins took some cheap shots against religious beliefs. Yes yes, we all get it, science and religion are on opposite wavelengths. You don't need to be a jackass about it. "
821,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30553624-mrsagnello,5,"I really enjoyed this piece. Listening to it as an audiobook was particularly effective, I think, because you could hear the joy and excitement in the readers' voices (read partially by Dawkins, partially by a woman). Essentially, this book is a review of high school science, but without the irritations, boredom, and hormones. Dawkins shows a genuine love of science and shares his enthusiasm through well-crafted prose that, thought it dives into challenges topics, never felt stuffy or too challenging. I would recommend this as a fantastic book for anyone interested in how the world works, especially as a primer to reading more in-depth works, such as A Short History of Nearly Everything. Additionally, I would recommend this book to any ""baby"" atheist looking for information about how the world works. "

This book is an example of the great scientific interesting vulgarisation. Starting from ""What is reality?"" till ""What is miracle?"", I couldn't predict what author gonna say before I enter into an actual chapter. I guess, there his brilliance challenging us. Sometimes, I wonder how can he touch so easily those sensitive topics , commenting on it and cleverly driving us to believe in it etc. Magic Vs Reality, Gods,Myth Vs Sceince , DNA Evolution, Dromerdeener, gene pool etc He is answering for all crazy questions in an intelligent funny acceptable way... haha... Simply I love his writing. I enjoyed each and every line of this book. The time I took to complete this or chew his thoughts can show , how much I enjoyed his writing by reading it again and again. :) I strongly recommend for all. Hats off Dawkins!"
823,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6874323-thomas-ray,1,"This is not so much a book of science, as an attack on religion. And, it's not an attack on religion as it is, but as the author imagines it to be. In the author's misunderstood view, religion is merely and solely a poor man's science, whose purpose was just to describe the cosmos mythologically, when we didn't know any better--and we should be done with religion by now. To the contrary, religion is about developing spiritual strength, to prepare oneself for the moments of moral crisis in life. Without that strength, we lack the needed grace, fall from the path, and suffer. The author doesn't know this, as he hasn't bothered to find out. Instead, he relies on his preconceived, wrong notions of religion. And writes about religion without understanding what it's about. The author's approach to writing about religion is the reverse of scientific. It's dogmatic."
824,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"A well-written book but too basic and too short. This book is a kind of ""Cliff Notes"" on most elementary, and important, scientific topics like natural evolution, Newtonian/Copernicus astronomy, the nature of atoms etc. There is not much to be learnt for anyone who has gone through the high school science courses without sleeping. The author's objectives are different (or same if you have read him before): to debunk the non-scientific, particularly religious notions of how we came in to being. So while the book brings little that would be new to seasoned readers (of almost any kind), the way the book is put together makes it an easy read with many interesting myths, anecdotes and language twists to describe some scientific concepts. The book is more useful for teens and/or people at impressionable ages."

Another reason I liked it tremendously is that I had my first audio book experience with it; where Dawkins reads through all the chapters with his wife. Although some information presented was basic and sometimes critical of beliefs and religious thoughts, the way it was illustrated was fascinating as each chapter starts with a myth and then is explained scientifically. Questions like ""What is an earthquake?"" and "" What is the sun?"" are answered. This book is quite suitable for all ages, and it really evokes wonderment in you. I particularly loved how he explained magic in the first chapter, and how the most beauty lies in the poetic-and real sense of the world. It is true, the magic of unraveling a mystery and the road to discovery is indeed, beautiful."

People who are about age 12 and above can read this book. The type of the book is non-fiction, science, true stories, legends, theories and thoughts. I’ve chosen this book because my friend told me to read it. There are 12 chapters in it, each chapter has real question like what is rainbow? What’s the sun? Etc. Moreover, Richard answers to those questions logically and realistic it’s kind of magic if you imagine and think about it. I really enjoy reading it and the best part was in the first chapter, its talk about biology and I really love anything about biology. Also the writer talks about the scientist. Richard impressed me so I did a search for him and I found that he’s an English ethnologist and evolutionary biologist. "
827,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13514620-matilda-rose,3,"Each chapter in this book explains the question in the title of that chapter. The first chapter explains what magic is. According to Richard Dawkins, there are three different types of magic - supernatural magic, stage magic, and poetic magic. Supernatural magic is something not scientifically possible, something that only happens in fairytales. Stage magic is an illusion to make you think what you’re seeing is magic, but it’s really all just a complex trick.The book ends with ‘What is a miracle?’, in which Dawkins talks about how to decide what a miracle is. Decide the possible explanations and select the most likely. It’s probably just a coincidence. Some coincidences can become what seems a miracle by exaggerated re-tellings.I thought this book was okay. It was written well, and a few of the things I was interested in, but as far non-fiction books go, it was good!"
828,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31189533-toni,5,"SHORTDawkins captivatingly guides us through the realms of science, and contrasts it with mythical beliefs. Enlightening new knowledge that gives one a new vision of nature.MEDIUM At the cover of this book’s edition there’s a short summary by Ricky Gervais which says essentially that this book makes you smarter. I could not agree more. Reading this book will most likely fill some knowledge gap for you that you weren’t aware of. It sure did for me. Chapters often start with old - and not so old - myths and religious stories regarding topics of reality life. These stories are then contrasted with science’s explanations to the same phenomena. Such a structure displays the superior strength of science over non-evidence based beliefs. Dawkins guides us delightfully through the realms of biology, astronomy, physics, ethics, and many more. Without a doubt this book will enlighten you in some way or another, it will make you wonder and observe things in nature differently. I profoundly enjoyed the trip.LONGESTImagine you are assigned with the task of explaining to your young teenager cousin the origin of biology as we know and live it. You will have to mention how diverse life on Earth is, even beyond science’s reach. And how it’s organized - sometimes fuzzily - in different kingdoms: plants, animals, microscopic life… How can one tackle such an assignment?One reasonable option is to opt for a reductionist - macro to micro - approach. We start off with a complex being such as an elephant, then “simplify” down to a fly that probably flies around it. From here we can focus on the uni-neuronal worm crawling around the same scene, then the grass our elephant is stepping on until the point we include a simple bacteria floating in the pond on the ground. You know these beings - and all the rest on the planet including us humans - are all related, part of their DNA is shared. They all derive from the same ancestor - millions of years ago. But how can you explain their relationship? One word: evolution. Evolution must certainly be part of your explanation then, it links all these seemingly unrelated beings together.You may be asked this question, understandably: how can we know what happened millions of years ago? The answer is that scientists infer it from fossils and geological layers. Fossils are preserved instances of past living creatures that often no longer exist at the same evolutionary step. So they don’t exist but yet they are real? Precisely, reality is not just what we see or know, it’s also what used to exist in one shape or another. How can we understand things that don’t exist and don’t have access to? By using models. Building models allows scientists to fill the gaps missing in the knowledge puzzle. As new evidence appears those models are refined, rebuilt or many times completely rejected. This is the basis of the scientific method. Clearly core concepts such as models, fossils, the role of geology and the scientific method must be included in your explanation.Eventually the reductionist approach will reach the atom, and inevitably the diversity of atoms (N, H, O, Fe). Atoms are what physical matter is made of, and atoms themselves are made up of neutrons, electrons, and positrons, but let’s stop the reductionist trip here.Where did all this matter come from? Well matter essentially derived from old stars in space that collapsed and left orbiting stardust trails. They in turn collapsed into other stardust clouds forming bigger chunks, and so on until those chunks were big as a planet. Mix this with the irradiating energy from active stars - such as our Sun - and gravity forces, and you “cook” the current planet we now live in.That energy irradiated from the Sun is in the form of electromagnetic waves spanning a very broad spectrum of frequencies. And indeed part of these waves are the reason we see things, name the visible light part of the spectrum. We know all this thanks in big part to Newton’s experiments with light. So clearly you can’t miss mentioning him and his experiments with light in your explanation.But the universe is not just stars, Earth’s biology, other planets and energy. There might quite likely be extra-terrestrial creatures inhabiting some part of the universe. Aliens are absolutely a serious and very scientific wonder, it’s one you can’t avoid talking about in your assignment. Everyone is somewhat curious about extra-terrestrial life.Now let’s go back to Earth and all its good things and bad things. From an Earthling’s perspective phenomena like wars and diseases are undoubtedly bad and undesirable. But what if we look at it from a cosmic point of view? It really doesn’t make the universe better or worse, it’s just part of a process.Luckily science has gone a long way, and many of our questions have reasonable answers nowadays. Our human ancestors weren’t so lucky. They observed the world with awe, wondering about things we are certain nowadays thanks to science. Their technology wasn’t as advanced then, so many of their knowledge gaps were filled with inventions such as myths and religious stories. Which along generations derived in the current religious beliefs present in human societies.In summary, you’ve been assigned an herculean task. One cannot easily explain all these topics and link them together in a clear and interesting manner. You would need extraordinary didactic and synthetic abilities. Not mentioning of course a clear and accessible language and solid understanding of most of science’s branches.While you could go and try to accomplish such a task yourself, I would rather recommend you to read “Magic of Reality” instead. It geniusly explains all these topics and many more perfectly. Additionally it does so in an absolutely captivating way. You probably would not accomplish this task better than Dawkins, I certainly would not."
829,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1209894-sara-frances,5,"this book is awesome, like life-changing awesome. if i had read this book as a little girl (not that my parents would have let me anywhere near this book when i was little) i might be a scientist right now, for real. sadly i'm too old and dumb to totally change things up like that. but this book has installed a new sense of wonderment in me about how fantastically interesting our universe and life is. Dawkins is incredibly talented at explaining very complex things and his writing is not boring or nap-inducing at all. LOVE! the artwork is also top-notch and really helped clarify some of the more abstract ideas in this book. The Magic of Reality really puts all other science text books to shame. "
830,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6974559-jo-jo,4,"This book lets us realize how ridiculous myths are and why they are written. By giving one or two mythical explanations then the more complicated and more sensible. My favorite chapter was the last one where if something unusual happend not to rule out the possibility of magic but to see what was the most likely explanation was. This an example from the book. A dealer deals out a pack of 52 playing cards to four men and every one gets all the same suit here are three explanations1. The dealer has used magic2. It is pure chance ( the odds against this are 536,447,737,765,488,792,839,237,440,000 to 1)3. The dealer has arranged the cards I think 3 probably happend.

Nonetheless, Dawkins is a great teacher and does not necessarily talk down to his readers; I found the tone just fine contrary to some complaints. Dawkin just wanted the book to be accessible to all, including teenegers and slows like me :). The book answers (eloquently) all questions that 'you were afraid to ask but wanted to (really) know' such as; who was the first person, when did the universe began, is rainbow as simple as it's described, what is the sun---how it came about....e.t.cI liked how he started by describing myths involved in each question and the way he progressed towards the real magic; the magic of here and now. It's a perfect five!"
832,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,3,"Rating: 3 out of 5*. Already when this book was published I had decided not to read it. But lo' n' behold, in an overcrowded airport book shop, it managed to creep into my possession nonetheless. I should have stayed with my initial assesment.It's not really a bad book. It's superbly written for 10-12 year olds. My biggest problem was the condescending tone of the narrative and the fact that I did not learn a single new fact, if you disregard a few myths I hadn't encountered before. It's just a rehash - tremendously simplified - of things I've been over many times before. Buy it for your children, nephews or nieces. If you're the least bit scientifically inclined, you do not need to read it for yourself."
833,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30877314-francis-chin,4,"The best way to review this fascinating book is to give you an excerpt where Dawkins asks whether we have ever been sexually assaulted by demons, abducted by aliens or attacked by vampires. To many folks who said yes, their experience was real as far as they are concerned. But does it mean demons and vampires exist?Here’s the explanation by scientist Richard Dawkins in his book, The Magic of Reality – how we know what’s really true (2011):FALSE memory syndrome helps us understand why at least some of the people who think they have been abducted by aliens claim to have such vivid memories of the incident. What usually happens is that a person becomes obsessed with aliens through reading stories in the newspapers about other alleged abductions. Often, these people are fans of Star Trek or other science fiction tales. It is a striking fact that the aliens they think they’ve met usually look very like the ones portrayed in the most recent television fiction about aliens, and they usually do the same kind of ""experiments"" as have recently been seen on television.The next thing that may happen is that the person is afflicted by a frightening experience called sleep paralysis. It is not uncommon.You may even have experienced it yourself, in which case I hope it will be a bit less scary the next time it happens if I explain it to you now.Normally, when you are asleep and dreaming, your body is paralysed. I supposed it’s to stop your muscles working in tune with your dreams and making you sleepwalk (though this does, of course, sometimes happen). And normally, when you wake and your dream vanishes, the paralysis goes and you can move your muscles.But occasionally there is a delay between your mind returning to consciousness and your muscles coming back to life, and that is called sleep paralysis. It is frightening, as you can imagine. You are sort of awake, and you can see your bedroom and everything in it, but you can’t move. Sleep paralysis is often accompanied by terrifying hallucinations. People feel surrounded by a sense of dreadful danger, which they can’t put a name to. Sometimes they even see things that are not there, just as in a dream. And, also as in a dream, to the dreamer they seem absolutely real. Now, if you are going to have a hallucination when you suffer sleep paralysis, what might that hallucination look like? A modern science fiction fan might well see little grey men with big heads and wraparound eyes. In earlier centuries, before science fiction came along, the visions people saw were different: hobgoblins, perhaps, or werewolves; bloodsucking vampires or (if they were lucky) beautiful winged angels.The point is that the images people see when experiencing sleep paralysis are not really there but are conjured up in the mind from past fears, legends or fiction. Even if they don’t hallucinate, the experience is so frightening that, when they finally wake up, sleep paralysis victims often believe that something horrible has happened to them. If you are primed to believe in vampires, you might wake with a strong belief that a bloodsucker has attacked you. If I am primed to believe in alien abductions I might wake up believing that I was abducted and my memory then wiped clean by aliens.The next thing that typically happens to sleep paralysis victims is that, even if they didn’t actually hallucinate aliens and gruesome experiments at the time, their fearful reconstruction of what they suspect may have happened becomes consolidated as a false memory. This process is often helped along by friends and family, who eagerly pump them for more and more detailed accounts of what happened, and even prompt them with leading questions: “Were there aliens there? What colour were they? Were they grey? Did they have big wraparound eyes like in the movies?”Even questions can be enough to implant or cement a false memory. When you look at it like this, it is not so surprising that a 1992 poll concluded that nearly four million Americans thought they had been abducted by aliens.Psychologist Sue Blackmore points out that sleep paralysis was the most likely cause of earlier imagined horrors, too, before the idea of space aliens became popular. In medieval times people claimed to have been visited in the middle of the night by an ‘incubus’ (a male demon visiting a female victim to have sex with her) or ‘succubus’ (a female demon visiting a male victim to have sex with him). One of the effects of sleep paralysis is that, if you try to move, it feels as though something is pressing down on your body. This could easily be interpreted by the terrified victim as a sexual assault.Legend in Newfoundland talks of an Old Hag who visits people in the night and presses down on their chests. And there is a legend in Indochina of a Grey Ghost who visits people in the dark and paralyses them.So we have a good understanding of why people believe they have been abducted by aliens, and we can tie the modern myths of alien abduction in with earlier myths of rapacious incubi and succubi, or of vampires with long canine teeth who visit in the night and suck our blood. There is no good evidence at all that this planet has ever been visited by aliens from outer space (or, for that matter, by incubi or succubi or demons of any kind). But we are still left with the question of whether there actually are living things on other planets. Just because they haven’t visited us it doesn’t mean they don’t exist. Could the same process of evolution, or even a very different process that perhaps resembles our kind of evolution only slightly, have got going on other planets as well as ours?End of excerptBy the way, read Hallucinations by Dr Oliver Sacks (2012), for a detailed description of how an individual (including Dr Sacks himself) sees and interacts with things, humans and other creatures created inside their mind. As far as the individual is concerned, everything before his or her eyes is real and solid. Dr Sacks mentions that one Sunday morning, two friends Jim and Katy, dropped by his house. He went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast for them. Here's Dr Sacks account: ""Then, five minutes later, I shouted, 'Everything's ready,' put their ham and eggs on a tray, walked into the living room—and found it empty. No Jim, no Kathy, no sign that they had ever been there. I was so staggered I almost dropped the tray. It had not occurred to me for an instant that Jim and Kathy's voices, their 'presences', were unreal, hallucinatory. We had had a friendly, ordinary conversation, just as we usually had.Their voices were the same as always—there was no hint, until I opened the swinging doors and found the living room empty, that the whole conversation, at least their side of it, had been invented by my brain.PS. In my own edition of Dawkin's book, there were some fabulous illustrations including the scary one of a demon squatting on a sleeping woman. It's a pity this web site doesn't have a section to display images. Message me if you want to see the sleep demon!"
834,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,5,"Ricky Gervais says of The Magic of Reality: “I wanted to write this book but I wasn’t clever enough. Now I’ve read it, I am.” I've found that Dawkins gets more readable the more he writes. Simpler than Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" (simpler, of course, because this was written for children and young adults, but I venture to say that a considerable percentage of the American voting population could learn something from this book), Dawkins does a wonderful job addressing myths and reality in a rational, non-confrontational way - atypical for the Dawkins of late...the non-confrontational, that is.Recommended. Even for adults. Especially for children."
835,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"A wonderful & ""magical"" book! Clearly intended (also) for younger readers, Richard Dawkins explains elemantary facts and phenomena of life (rainbows, earthquakes, evolution etc) in his clearly unique way. And by doing so he reveals how magical our world as experienced thanks to and through science already is - without tales of magic, miracles and other nonsense.Unfortunately, neither my Kindle edition nor the paperback version are as beautifully illustrated as the hardcover apparently is (except for the small illustrations at the beginning of each chapter). But I bought the book because of Dawkins and the science facts so it's not really a downer."
836,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5814532-jim,4,"What a fascinating book. I realize this is written at a rather primary level, but there's so much here that was just never covered when I was going through school that it almost seemed new to me. The beauty of science. The magic of reality. Dawkins does a great job in showing us how amazing nature is. Of course, there's the requisite, constant reminder that all and every religion is completely and crazily untrue, and that gets pretty old. But the real stuff - the science - is just plain cool. Very enjoyable read. Of course, Dave McKean's illustrations merely serve to make the book that much better. Recommended. "
837,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"Once again, I found Richard Dawkins a Pleasure to read. In this book, he illustrates a number of areas in science. On each topic, he gives some of the various myths on the topic at hand; then he presents the science behind it. Science wins out. Dawkins just has the knack of explanation—keeping it fresh and interesting. One example is, the red shift of the galaxies as evidence for the big bang. It is explained that the spectrum of the light shows the the same patterns, but they are shift to the red. I read about this numerous times. This is the first time I caught on to how scientist can tell that the light is shifted. For Dawkins fans or not, I can recommend this book."
838,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164533-lilit,5,"The book is meant for younger audience as it provides very basic, yet coherent, very structured and still exciting, information on the subjects discussed. Moreover, the style of starting every chapter with myths followed by the scientific evidence is rather impactful. The book challenges your mind in terms of prompting you to think what are all the other myths that we have accepted as reality and seldom think whether they REALLY are TRUE. It is not a dull science book! I was impressed by how well Dawkins managed to trigger my imagination to clearly picture all the things described in his book. "
839,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6820027-peter-cawdron,5,"I'm reading this with my kids at night on the iPad, which is an excellent medium, as it has the entire book plus beautiful illustrations and a number of interactive features, like breeding frogs over successive generations to see if they can survive predation by snakes. The kids loved experimenting with that, seeing how the concept of selection works first hand. This is a book you'll love reading with your kids, and is suitable for children from 8-14 (plus there's plenty for us old farts to learn too)"
840,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33410234-dan-croft,3,"This book started out well enough; somewhat like The Universe in a Nutshell or similar books about science. I'd say the subject matter discussed is pretty basic for anyone who has a working knowledge of high school and maybe some college level chemistry, biology, physics, etc. Even so, Dawkins has an entertaining and enjoyable writing style, which make it fun to listen, even if it is review. In the beginning of the book Dawkins seem to have a genuine interest in helping the novice person interested in science (but with no background in it) understand some basic precepts. As the book progresses, particularly in the last two chapters, the purpose of the book appears to shift from science education to debunking the supernatural aspects of religion. Dawkins is a well known and outspoken atheist, so it is certainly understandable why he would want to point out his views. However, towards the end he begins to become repetitive, which really grinds down the reader. His points are valid and well taken, but he fails to give any credit to religion as anything more than mythology that should be interpreted literally. The fact that he fails to acknowledge religion as a more abstract philosophy and code of ethics leads the reader to believe that he, not the reader, is the one missing the point. "
841,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237803-m,4,"As one of the reviews on the cover described it, ""A Perfect Introduction to Science"", which it is indeed. Another well-written book by Richard Dawkins, much lighter and simpler than most of his books, mainly targeting more general readers serving to find the magic in truth rather than myths, and to show how reality can be sometimes more entertaining than fiction. For me, there was little new there but I thoroughly enjoyed the way it was written and the calm and patient approach to explaining scientific concepts. Each chapter discussed a scientific topic or phenomenon, it started with listing some of the legends that tried to explain this subject, then slowly discussing the scientific explanation of the phenomenon focusing on the beauty of the truth and how it can be more magical (not in the supernatural sense of the word) than the myths and fantasies created and passed on over generations.This is an essential read to help increase basic science literacy. The light version of science here might appeal to the general reader who finds it difficult to read a science book. The introduction and final chapter can serve as an eye-opener for some readers, though you would normally think that a Richard Dawkins' reader will normally be already familiar with these ideas."
842,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22748104-josh-taylor,2,"I think the pilgrimage Dawkins is on trying to teaching people the illogicality of their ways and show them there is beauty in science is fine, admirable in a way. But people that do not agree with that line of thought are hardly likely to pick up one of Dawkins books. So why preach to the converted? What I found as a scientist was a book filled with common sense explanation.The illogical beliefs/theory’s that people hold that he disproves through explanation, although well explained are trivial and therefore his explanations come across in my opinion as patronizing to the reader. And I would have thought that to be the case for the majority of people who read this book science layman or not. I am not having a go at Dawkins I just think he is out of touch with the times, the Selfish Gene was revolutionary and shocking at the time of its release due to its controversial contents compared to the widely held believes of the populous at the time. Now I feel like he’s trying to do the same thing. I thought this book would highlight the mind bending and amazing things that are happening in modern science such as quantum entanglement stuff that makes you go WOW. Instead it was just a dig at the minority of people that hold certain beliefs. "
843,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48066-chazzle,4,"I really enjoyed this book about general science, and how we know what we know. Although written at a middle school level, interesting observations abound. For example, suppose you look through a telescope at a star that's 100 million light years away. That means you're looking at something that happened 100 million years ago. As such, if you happened to be observing intelligent life looking at us, they would be seeing dinosaurs, not you, in the present moment! Wild! This is an example of the poetic magic of reality, giving the book's title.I happened upon a youtube video with Bill O'Reilly interviewing author Richard Dawkins, while actually trying to find another link recommended by the author in the book itself. And O'Reilly's point is true, IMHO. Indeed, the author does spend a good portion of time dismantling the miracle stories of various religions, including Christianity, in a book marketed to the young. So, if you're a biblical literalist, or prefer that your child not have the miracle accounts in his scripture debunked, this might not be the book for you. As I see it, though, Dawkins' grip on reality is much, much firmer than O'Reilly's."
844,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1784379-jess-cattanach,4,"The Magic of Reality is the first Dawkins book I’ve read, but I feel like it was a good introduction to his works. Relatively short and easily digestible, this book is perfect for a quick read between tasks. Dawkins addresses a number of things that many people have little scientific understanding about, and introduces each chapter in a very nifty fashion: by describing some of the myths people have come up with over the years to describe the phenomena. After this humorous introduction he goes on to explain what actually occurs in a way that is both scientifically sound and understandable, even for those with no science background.I may be a little biased, being a science student and overall science geek, but I really did enjoy this book. Dawkins’ writing style flows together quite nicely and even if you know how one of the processes work he writes it in a way that makes it still engaging to read.Really, I think the thing that makes this book stand out is its wonderful contrast between myth and reality (hence the title!) It very neatly wraps up, too, that everything has a sound explanation, even if we are yet to find out what that explanation is. "
845,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,3,"Standing on its own, I should give this book 5 stars. It is written for an audience that is not science literate and it not only does the job but it actually very enligtening and gives the reader a sense of joy vis-a-vis astronomy and other forms of science.That said, I rated it 3 starts because I'm comparing it to his other books which were so much better. I'm still not sure how this rating system works but I tend not to rate a book on its own merit but to compare it to other books the same author has written - that is, if I've read other books by the same author. So maybe my ""3"" is not altogether fair.Getting back to the book, this one would be a FANTASTIC book assignment for high school students who are taking science classes and are struggling with the Big Questions like, ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" Why is this or that thing bad luck?"" ... you get the idea. Dawkins turns the reader to science and helps her to understand that there are marvelous and surreal experiences to be had aside from subscribing circumstances to superstition."
846,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310403-kyle,3,"A handbook for junior sceptics and parents not wanting their children growing up deluded about gods, myths or magic, Dawkins covers a lot of ground from earliest traces of life on earth to the reason rainbows appear in the sky, plus how the planets and stars maintain their relative position to our rotating/revolving peppercorn. There are a few fields he dares not enter, such as quarks and other subatomic processes, which he leaves out of the book. Most chapters seem as backwards as the title: in attempting to prove the reality of what others would claim to be magic, he gives a passing description of what scientists have observed that are preceded by the wild and occasionally amusing myths from around the world, all of which are assuredly wrong. Wouldn't more children be interested in being talked up to by learning a scientific concept first, and then finding out the amazing variety of stories different cultures have provided to explain the concept without science but with a more alchemical sense of reality?"
847,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17891225-karnika-kapoor,4,"It was interesting to read about the mythological stories from different cultures and eras. I was rather more impressed by ""The God Delusion"" than by ""The magic of reality"". Perhaps, because it was my first Richard Dawkins's book and I was hugely impressed by the argument made there (as the same was in my subconscious all my life). The debunking of myth in this book is something not very new to me. However, it includes bits and peaces of information that I was not aware of and I profoundly enjoyed gaining information about those bits. I specifically liked the part related to ""sleep paralysis"" as I experience the same quite often. Back in my ""Theistic"" days, I use to relate it with supernatural (Guilty as charged). But as I started to think rationally over things, it was not quite logical to follow. I recommend this book to people seeking an empirical evidence against the so-called ""miracle"" of past. A typical Dawkins style approach to encourage people to think rationally. I enjoyed reading it. "
848,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6137539-david-h,0,"Magic Reality is a very good children's book on general science. It is based strictly on evolution and cosmology. It is Richard Dawkins way of fighting what he called The God Delusion in an earlier book. Once this delusion takes hold of the mind, it cannot be removed. So it must not be allowed in at all. Children must never be taught about God or any supernatural creatures except as myths. A child's view of reality must be the child's first view of reality. Because it is new, it will seem magic. Hence the title, The Magic of Reality. Children are natural-born scientists. Any intelligent observer of children at play will see this. They observe, they wonder, they test, they wonder some more...until some stupid adult pulls them away and fills their little heads with Adam and Eve and the snake and the apple. So Dawkins has written a book as much fun as fairy tales, as exciting as pirate stories, and as full of true spirituality as any of the crap they teach in Sunday School."
849,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5731693-jerry-stroh,4,"This children's book by Richard Dawkins & illustrated by Dave McKean (of Sandman fame) is great and I highly recommend it to anyone, even adults, because there is a lot of info here which even I didn't know about science - and I mean general stuff that in an ideal world, nobody with a public school education shouldn't know - and again, like most of Dawkins' books, it makes science interesting. My favorite part was about rainbows. I think every child around 10 should be given this book to read. Right about the time they learn the truth about Santa Claus. You know, when it's the right time to teach children the difference between fiction and reality. So they understand that rainbows are formed by light reflected through falling rain and were not created by 'God' after the myth of Noah and his crowded ark, for example. And other stuff about the reality of evolution and the fiction of the supernatural."
850,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7664274-sarah,3,"I'm in no way a scientific genius. My brain is ruled by myth and magic more than logic and hard facts. That's not to say that I don't adore learning about the world and learning about the reality of the times in which we live. I suppose that's why I was drawn to this book- 'The Magic of Reality'. What a fantastic title! I was also encouraged by the fact that this book was written 'for people of all generations' and yes, it was easy to understand. Dawkins has a remarkable ability to flawlessly simplify really difficult science. I think there's something very appealing about a scientist who can make physics and chemistry appealing and relateable. My only issue was that, at times, it was patronising and holier than thou. I may not be a religious person, but even then I felt that Dawkins took some cheap shots against religious beliefs. Yes yes, we all get it, science and religion are on opposite wavelengths. You don't need to be a jackass about it. "

Listening to it as an audiobook was particularly effective, I think, because you could hear the joy and excitement in the readers' voices (read partially by Dawkins, partially by a woman). Essentially, this book is a review of high school science, but without the irritations, boredom, and hormones. Dawkins shows a genuine love of science and shares his enthusiasm through well-crafted prose that, thought it dives into challenges topics, never felt stuffy or too challenging. I would recommend this as a fantastic book for anyone interested in how the world works, especially as a primer to reading more in-depth works, such as A Short History of Nearly Everything. Additionally, I would recommend this book to any ""baby"" atheist looking for information about how the world works. "

This book is an example of the great scientific interesting vulgarisation. Starting from ""What is reality?"" till ""What is miracle?"", I couldn't predict what author gonna say before I enter into an actual chapter. I guess, there his brilliance challenging us. Sometimes, I wonder how can he touch so easily those sensitive topics , commenting on it and cleverly driving us to believe in it etc. Magic Vs Reality, Gods,Myth Vs Sceince , DNA Evolution, Dromerdeener, gene pool etc He is answering for all crazy questions in an intelligent funny acceptable way... haha... Simply I love his writing. I enjoyed each and every line of this book. The time I took to complete this or chew his thoughts can show , how much I enjoyed his writing by reading it again and again. :) I strongly recommend for all. Hats off Dawkins!"
853,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6874323-thomas-ray,1,"This is not so much a book of science, as an attack on religion. And, it's not an attack on religion as it is, but as the author imagines it to be. In the author's misunderstood view, religion is merely and solely a poor man's science, whose purpose was just to describe the cosmos mythologically, when we didn't know any better--and we should be done with religion by now. To the contrary, religion is about developing spiritual strength, to prepare oneself for the moments of moral crisis in life. Without that strength, we lack the needed grace, fall from the path, and suffer. The author doesn't know this, as he hasn't bothered to find out. Instead, he relies on his preconceived, wrong notions of religion. And writes about religion without understanding what it's about. The author's approach to writing about religion is the reverse of scientific. It's dogmatic."
854,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"A well-written book but too basic and too short. This book is a kind of ""Cliff Notes"" on most elementary, and important, scientific topics like natural evolution, Newtonian/Copernicus astronomy, the nature of atoms etc. There is not much to be learnt for anyone who has gone through the high school science courses without sleeping. The author's objectives are different (or same if you have read him before): to debunk the non-scientific, particularly religious notions of how we came in to being. So while the book brings little that would be new to seasoned readers (of almost any kind), the way the book is put together makes it an easy read with many interesting myths, anecdotes and language twists to describe some scientific concepts. The book is more useful for teens and/or people at impressionable ages."

Another reason I liked it tremendously is that I had my first audio book experience with it; where Dawkins reads through all the chapters with his wife. Although some information presented was basic and sometimes critical of beliefs and religious thoughts, the way it was illustrated was fascinating as each chapter starts with a myth and then is explained scientifically. Questions like ""What is an earthquake?"" and "" What is the sun?"" are answered. This book is quite suitable for all ages, and it really evokes wonderment in you. I particularly loved how he explained magic in the first chapter, and how the most beauty lies in the poetic-and real sense of the world. It is true, the magic of unraveling a mystery and the road to discovery is indeed, beautiful."

People who are about age 12 and above can read this book. The type of the book is non-fiction, science, true stories, legends, theories and thoughts. I’ve chosen this book because my friend told me to read it. There are 12 chapters in it, each chapter has real question like what is rainbow? What’s the sun? Etc. Moreover, Richard answers to those questions logically and realistic it’s kind of magic if you imagine and think about it. I really enjoy reading it and the best part was in the first chapter, its talk about biology and I really love anything about biology. Also the writer talks about the scientist. Richard impressed me so I did a search for him and I found that he’s an English ethnologist and evolutionary biologist. "

According to Richard Dawkins, there are three different types of magic - supernatural magic, stage magic, and poetic magic. Supernatural magic is something not scientifically possible, something that only happens in fairytales. Stage magic is an illusion to make you think what you’re seeing is magic, but it’s really all just a complex trick.The book ends with ‘What is a miracle?’, in which Dawkins talks about how to decide what a miracle is. Decide the possible explanations and select the most likely. It’s probably just a coincidence. Some coincidences can become what seems a miracle by exaggerated re-tellings.I thought this book was okay. It was written well, and a few of the things I was interested in, but as far non-fiction books go, it was good!"
858,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31189533-toni,5,"SHORTDawkins captivatingly guides us through the realms of science, and contrasts it with mythical beliefs. Enlightening new knowledge that gives one a new vision of nature.MEDIUM At the cover of this book’s edition there’s a short summary by Ricky Gervais which says essentially that this book makes you smarter. I could not agree more. Reading this book will most likely fill some knowledge gap for you that you weren’t aware of. It sure did for me. Chapters often start with old - and not so old - myths and religious stories regarding topics of reality life. These stories are then contrasted with science’s explanations to the same phenomena. Such a structure displays the superior strength of science over non-evidence based beliefs. Dawkins guides us delightfully through the realms of biology, astronomy, physics, ethics, and many more. Without a doubt this book will enlighten you in some way or another, it will make you wonder and observe things in nature differently. I profoundly enjoyed the trip.LONGESTImagine you are assigned with the task of explaining to your young teenager cousin the origin of biology as we know and live it. You will have to mention how diverse life on Earth is, even beyond science’s reach. And how it’s organized - sometimes fuzzily - in different kingdoms: plants, animals, microscopic life… How can one tackle such an assignment?One reasonable option is to opt for a reductionist - macro to micro - approach. We start off with a complex being such as an elephant, then “simplify” down to a fly that probably flies around it. From here we can focus on the uni-neuronal worm crawling around the same scene, then the grass our elephant is stepping on until the point we include a simple bacteria floating in the pond on the ground. You know these beings - and all the rest on the planet including us humans - are all related, part of their DNA is shared. They all derive from the same ancestor - millions of years ago. But how can you explain their relationship? One word: evolution. Evolution must certainly be part of your explanation then, it links all these seemingly unrelated beings together.You may be asked this question, understandably: how can we know what happened millions of years ago? The answer is that scientists infer it from fossils and geological layers. Fossils are preserved instances of past living creatures that often no longer exist at the same evolutionary step. So they don’t exist but yet they are real? Precisely, reality is not just what we see or know, it’s also what used to exist in one shape or another. How can we understand things that don’t exist and don’t have access to? By using models. Building models allows scientists to fill the gaps missing in the knowledge puzzle. As new evidence appears those models are refined, rebuilt or many times completely rejected. This is the basis of the scientific method. Clearly core concepts such as models, fossils, the role of geology and the scientific method must be included in your explanation.Eventually the reductionist approach will reach the atom, and inevitably the diversity of atoms (N, H, O, Fe). Atoms are what physical matter is made of, and atoms themselves are made up of neutrons, electrons, and positrons, but let’s stop the reductionist trip here.Where did all this matter come from? Well matter essentially derived from old stars in space that collapsed and left orbiting stardust trails. They in turn collapsed into other stardust clouds forming bigger chunks, and so on until those chunks were big as a planet. Mix this with the irradiating energy from active stars - such as our Sun - and gravity forces, and you “cook” the current planet we now live in.That energy irradiated from the Sun is in the form of electromagnetic waves spanning a very broad spectrum of frequencies. And indeed part of these waves are the reason we see things, name the visible light part of the spectrum. We know all this thanks in big part to Newton’s experiments with light. So clearly you can’t miss mentioning him and his experiments with light in your explanation.But the universe is not just stars, Earth’s biology, other planets and energy. There might quite likely be extra-terrestrial creatures inhabiting some part of the universe. Aliens are absolutely a serious and very scientific wonder, it’s one you can’t avoid talking about in your assignment. Everyone is somewhat curious about extra-terrestrial life.Now let’s go back to Earth and all its good things and bad things. From an Earthling’s perspective phenomena like wars and diseases are undoubtedly bad and undesirable. But what if we look at it from a cosmic point of view? It really doesn’t make the universe better or worse, it’s just part of a process.Luckily science has gone a long way, and many of our questions have reasonable answers nowadays. Our human ancestors weren’t so lucky. They observed the world with awe, wondering about things we are certain nowadays thanks to science. Their technology wasn’t as advanced then, so many of their knowledge gaps were filled with inventions such as myths and religious stories. Which along generations derived in the current religious beliefs present in human societies.In summary, you’ve been assigned an herculean task. One cannot easily explain all these topics and link them together in a clear and interesting manner. You would need extraordinary didactic and synthetic abilities. Not mentioning of course a clear and accessible language and solid understanding of most of science’s branches.While you could go and try to accomplish such a task yourself, I would rather recommend you to read “Magic of Reality” instead. It geniusly explains all these topics and many more perfectly. Additionally it does so in an absolutely captivating way. You probably would not accomplish this task better than Dawkins, I certainly would not."

Dawkins is incredibly talented at explaining very complex things and his writing is not boring or nap-inducing at all. LOVE! the artwork is also top-notch and really helped clarify some of the more abstract ideas in this book. The Magic of Reality really puts all other science text books to shame. "
860,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6974559-jo-jo,4,"This book lets us realize how ridiculous myths are and why they are written. By giving one or two mythical explanations then the more complicated and more sensible. My favorite chapter was the last one where if something unusual happend not to rule out the possibility of magic but to see what was the most likely explanation was. This an example from the book. A dealer deals out a pack of 52 playing cards to four men and every one gets all the same suit here are three explanations1. The dealer has used magic2. It is pure chance ( the odds against this are 536,447,737,765,488,792,839,237,440,000 to 1)3. The dealer has arranged the cards I think 3 probably happend.

Nonetheless, Dawkins is a great teacher and does not necessarily talk down to his readers; I found the tone just fine contrary to some complaints. Dawkin just wanted the book to be accessible to all, including teenegers and slows like me :). The book answers (eloquently) all questions that 'you were afraid to ask but wanted to (really) know' such as; who was the first person, when did the universe began, is rainbow as simple as it's described, what is the sun---how it came about....e.t.cI liked how he started by describing myths involved in each question and the way he progressed towards the real magic; the magic of here and now.

But lo' n' behold, in an overcrowded airport book shop, it managed to creep into my possession nonetheless. I should have stayed with my initial assesment.It's not really a bad book. It's superbly written for 10-12 year olds. My biggest problem was the condescending tone of the narrative and the fact that I did not learn a single new fact, if you disregard a few myths I hadn't encountered before. It's just a rehash - tremendously simplified - of things I've been over many times before. Buy it for your children, nephews or nieces. If you're the least bit scientifically inclined, you do not need to read it for yourself."
863,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30877314-francis-chin,4,"The best way to review this fascinating book is to give you an excerpt where Dawkins asks whether we have ever been sexually assaulted by demons, abducted by aliens or attacked by vampires. To many folks who said yes, their experience was real as far as they are concerned. But does it mean demons and vampires exist?Here’s the explanation by scientist Richard Dawkins in his book, The Magic of Reality – how we know what’s really true (2011):FALSE memory syndrome helps us understand why at least some of the people who think they have been abducted by aliens claim to have such vivid memories of the incident. What usually happens is that a person becomes obsessed with aliens through reading stories in the newspapers about other alleged abductions. Often, these people are fans of Star Trek or other science fiction tales. It is a striking fact that the aliens they think they’ve met usually look very like the ones portrayed in the most recent television fiction about aliens, and they usually do the same kind of ""experiments"" as have recently been seen on television.The next thing that may happen is that the person is afflicted by a frightening experience called sleep paralysis. It is not uncommon.You may even have experienced it yourself, in which case I hope it will be a bit less scary the next time it happens if I explain it to you now.Normally, when you are asleep and dreaming, your body is paralysed. I supposed it’s to stop your muscles working in tune with your dreams and making you sleepwalk (though this does, of course, sometimes happen). And normally, when you wake and your dream vanishes, the paralysis goes and you can move your muscles.But occasionally there is a delay between your mind returning to consciousness and your muscles coming back to life, and that is called sleep paralysis. It is frightening, as you can imagine. You are sort of awake, and you can see your bedroom and everything in it, but you can’t move. Sleep paralysis is often accompanied by terrifying hallucinations. People feel surrounded by a sense of dreadful danger, which they can’t put a name to. Sometimes they even see things that are not there, just as in a dream. And, also as in a dream, to the dreamer they seem absolutely real. Now, if you are going to have a hallucination when you suffer sleep paralysis, what might that hallucination look like? A modern science fiction fan might well see little grey men with big heads and wraparound eyes. In earlier centuries, before science fiction came along, the visions people saw were different: hobgoblins, perhaps, or werewolves; bloodsucking vampires or (if they were lucky) beautiful winged angels.The point is that the images people see when experiencing sleep paralysis are not really there but are conjured up in the mind from past fears, legends or fiction. Even if they don’t hallucinate, the experience is so frightening that, when they finally wake up, sleep paralysis victims often believe that something horrible has happened to them. If you are primed to believe in vampires, you might wake with a strong belief that a bloodsucker has attacked you. If I am primed to believe in alien abductions I might wake up believing that I was abducted and my memory then wiped clean by aliens.The next thing that typically happens to sleep paralysis victims is that, even if they didn’t actually hallucinate aliens and gruesome experiments at the time, their fearful reconstruction of what they suspect may have happened becomes consolidated as a false memory. This process is often helped along by friends and family, who eagerly pump them for more and more detailed accounts of what happened, and even prompt them with leading questions: “Were there aliens there? What colour were they? Were they grey? Did they have big wraparound eyes like in the movies?”Even questions can be enough to implant or cement a false memory. When you look at it like this, it is not so surprising that a 1992 poll concluded that nearly four million Americans thought they had been abducted by aliens.Psychologist Sue Blackmore points out that sleep paralysis was the most likely cause of earlier imagined horrors, too, before the idea of space aliens became popular. In medieval times people claimed to have been visited in the middle of the night by an ‘incubus’ (a male demon visiting a female victim to have sex with her) or ‘succubus’ (a female demon visiting a male victim to have sex with him). One of the effects of sleep paralysis is that, if you try to move, it feels as though something is pressing down on your body. This could easily be interpreted by the terrified victim as a sexual assault.Legend in Newfoundland talks of an Old Hag who visits people in the night and presses down on their chests. And there is a legend in Indochina of a Grey Ghost who visits people in the dark and paralyses them.So we have a good understanding of why people believe they have been abducted by aliens, and we can tie the modern myths of alien abduction in with earlier myths of rapacious incubi and succubi, or of vampires with long canine teeth who visit in the night and suck our blood. There is no good evidence at all that this planet has ever been visited by aliens from outer space (or, for that matter, by incubi or succubi or demons of any kind). But we are still left with the question of whether there actually are living things on other planets. Just because they haven’t visited us it doesn’t mean they don’t exist. Could the same process of evolution, or even a very different process that perhaps resembles our kind of evolution only slightly, have got going on other planets as well as ours?End of excerptBy the way, read Hallucinations by Dr Oliver Sacks (2012), for a detailed description of how an individual (including Dr Sacks himself) sees and interacts with things, humans and other creatures created inside their mind. As far as the individual is concerned, everything before his or her eyes is real and solid. Dr Sacks mentions that one Sunday morning, two friends Jim and Katy, dropped by his house. He went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast for them. Here's Dr Sacks account: ""Then, five minutes later, I shouted, 'Everything's ready,' put their ham and eggs on a tray, walked into the living room—and found it empty. No Jim, no Kathy, no sign that they had ever been there. I was so staggered I almost dropped the tray. It had not occurred to me for an instant that Jim and Kathy's voices, their 'presences', were unreal, hallucinatory. We had had a friendly, ordinary conversation, just as we usually had.Their voices were the same as always—there was no hint, until I opened the swinging doors and found the living room empty, that the whole conversation, at least their side of it, had been invented by my brain.PS. In my own edition of Dawkin's book, there were some fabulous illustrations including the scary one of a demon squatting on a sleeping woman. It's a pity this web site doesn't have a section to display images. Message me if you want to see the sleep demon!"
864,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,5,"Ricky Gervais says of The Magic of Reality: “I wanted to write this book but I wasn’t clever enough. Now I’ve read it, I am.” I've found that Dawkins gets more readable the more he writes. Simpler than Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" (simpler, of course, because this was written for children and young adults, but I venture to say that a considerable percentage of the American voting population could learn something from this book), Dawkins does a wonderful job addressing myths and reality in a rational, non-confrontational way - atypical for the Dawkins of late...the non-confrontational, that is.Recommended. Even for adults. Especially for children."
865,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"A wonderful & ""magical"" book! Clearly intended (also) for younger readers, Richard Dawkins explains elemantary facts and phenomena of life (rainbows, earthquakes, evolution etc) in his clearly unique way. And by doing so he reveals how magical our world as experienced thanks to and through science already is - without tales of magic, miracles and other nonsense.Unfortunately, neither my Kindle edition nor the paperback version are as beautifully illustrated as the hardcover apparently is (except for the small illustrations at the beginning of each chapter). But I bought the book because of Dawkins and the science facts so it's not really a downer."
866,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5814532-jim,4,"What a fascinating book. I realize this is written at a rather primary level, but there's so much here that was just never covered when I was going through school that it almost seemed new to me. The beauty of science. The magic of reality. Dawkins does a great job in showing us how amazing nature is. Of course, there's the requisite, constant reminder that all and every religion is completely and crazily untrue, and that gets pretty old. But the real stuff - the science - is just plain cool. Very enjoyable read. Of course, Dave McKean's illustrations merely serve to make the book that much better. Recommended. "
867,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"Once again, I found Richard Dawkins a Pleasure to read. In this book, he illustrates a number of areas in science. On each topic, he gives some of the various myths on the topic at hand; then he presents the science behind it. Science wins out. Dawkins just has the knack of explanation—keeping it fresh and interesting. One example is, the red shift of the galaxies as evidence for the big bang. It is explained that the spectrum of the light shows the the same patterns, but they are shift to the red. I read about this numerous times. This is the first time I caught on to how scientist can tell that the light is shifted. For Dawkins fans or not, I can recommend this book."
868,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164533-lilit,5,"The book is meant for younger audience as it provides very basic, yet coherent, very structured and still exciting, information on the subjects discussed. Moreover, the style of starting every chapter with myths followed by the scientific evidence is rather impactful. The book challenges your mind in terms of prompting you to think what are all the other myths that we have accepted as reality and seldom think whether they REALLY are TRUE. It is not a dull science book! I was impressed by how well Dawkins managed to trigger my imagination to clearly picture all the things described in his book. "

Parts of this book read like a highschool chemistry textbook. That being said, I do like that the book is in mostly layman's terms. It is accessible to the masses and very direct. There is something for everyone in it. My personal favorite was the chapter on rainbows. I definitely learned a lot. While not the brooding, brilliant, passionate work that Hitchens' ""God is Not Great"" is, Dawkins' ""Magic of Reality"" is a short easy read, and well worth spending a few hours with."

What is magic? This chapter is about why Richard called this book” Magic of reality”Who was the first person? A fish.

911,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10633326-ida,4,"In The magic of reality, Dawkins gives a short introduction to a selection of wide ranging concepts, like evolution and extraterrestrial life. I thought the explanations were very well done. Even though many of the topics touched on comes with an extensive set of alienating terminology, Dawkins generally sticks to straightforward language. Sometimes I felt he tried too hard to pit myhts and superstition against modern science. The sentiment was fine and he was respectful, I just found the angle tireing after a while. It felt a bit out of place considering the demographic.Anyone already interested in science, will probably be familiar with most of the concepts in this book. I think the bigger thing to take away from it is the merits of critical thinking and the beauty of reality in itself. It is more or less a 300 page homage to the scientific method.Dawkins unveils the magic behind mundane phenomena in nature, and makes you wonder how you missed it for so long."

I could see how a 10-12 year old would really like it, and it's a great refresher for adults too. If only I had absorbed as much when I learned this stuff the first time.Perhaps more interesting is Dawkins's use of myths to introduce each chapter and provide a contrast to reality. It's clear that Dawkins, a noted atheist, has a point to make here. It's actually kind of funny/bizarre to read sentences like ""A Jewish legend tells how two cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, were destroyed by the Hebrew god because the people who lived there were so wicked,"" when you grew up hearing these stories told as if they were fact and as if God were ""God"" and not just one of many. I get what he's trying to do, but the approach still left me a bit cold even though I am no longer religious. While its obviously no longer reasonable to believe these myths as literal explanations of the physical world, Dawkins neglects their emotional heft and I found his attitude a bit flip."

Still worth the read if you liked his other books but just not as ground breaking as some of his others books.
917,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7032663-eric-wojciechowski,5,"If you don't know much about the nature of things; such as, that the Earth goes around the sun (an astonishing third of United States populace think the reverse), don't know that the Earth is four-and-a-half-billion-years-old (some still say six-thousand) or that all creatures on Earth are related to a common ancestor rather than poofing into existence, exactly as we are today, then this is the book for you. If you think “luck” has anything to do with outcomes, or if miracles occur, this is an excellent book to start with. Written for novices on such subject matters, and young adults, Richard Dawkins takes the sum of much of his other work (and that of others) and dials it down to fit a wider audience. This is an excellent and accessible collection of answers to origins, what things are made of (atoms), why do Earthquakes happen, what is the sun, etc. And while I consider myself to be knowledgeable in these areas (enough to get by, anyhow), I considered this work a nice refresher and worth the read.What I like about Mr. Dawkins is his ability to communicate these subjects on par with Carl Sagan. A scientist who can remove the equations and give us the facts, complete with examples and models (while the equations are there for further study if you wish). Mr. Dawkins also writes like he speaks. I'm rather certain he follows the writing rule to read out loud what you write. Does it sound good? If not, then re-write it. I can hear his voice as I'm reading this work, complete with British accent. What I enjoyed most was the subject of who was the first person. Probably because my five-year-old-daughter has been asking this one. The thought experiment given by Mr. Dawkins of taking a picture of yourself, then laying your father's picture on top, then grandfather, then great-grandfather and so on, (having to eventually imagine pictures of great-great-greats for lack of photos), the line up of photographs would be forty-miles long and total 185 million greats (or grancestors) to get back to when your ancestor was something of a fish. You could walk along this forty-mile length of pictures, pulling out groups here and there and see that pictures near each other would look alike, but pictures, say at the five-mile mark would be a completely different species than at the fifteen-mile mark. There was no first person. Little changes grow to big changes but lots of time is needed. It's the nature of the beast, if you will.And to understand this concept further, Mr. Dawkins shows us how language changes. Groups of people wander away from each other, both with the same language and dialect. But over time, words are added, dropped, changed in both groups. If enough time goes by, if the two should meet again, they wouldn't understand each other. Or maybe they would but it would be difficult. I'm personally thinking of how hard a time I have reading Shakespeare. Surely it's English but an English I'm not familiar with.In the age of Wikipedia, answers can be obtained quickly. So if you come away from this work wanting to know more, it's readily accessible. If you're new to these subjects or like a quick refresher on them, I recommend the Magic of Reality. Especially if you have young kids who need the answers, who ask these questions about firsts. Because that's when humans ask the most of them and, in my opinion, need correct answers. Because fixing bad answers is harder the longer a child retains them."

919,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3134966-sasha-martinez,0,"Had been reading this on and off, mostly in bursts, really; the book, though fun, tends to be a mind-numbing cascade of information. Sanity must be preserved: The book breaks down complex scientific truths more manageably, but, you know, brain hurt happens.The book’s written for a younger crowd, and I believe Dawkins wanted this to stand alongside [if not in place of] storybooks on myth-making heroes and fairytales. And, sure, bibles and their parables. But the grumpy atheist we’ve come to know in Dawkins is muted. He’s just this midly-peeved, impatient, and ultimately dismissive aura hovering over all the science-yum. (I’ve noticed, though, an awkwardness to the voice—but perhaps I’ve read him when he’s let loose, when he doesn’t need to temper?)The focus is on Science and its many wonders, even though, yes, the argument for each chapter is grounded on dismantling myth and religion. [No, silly, some blonde sun-god does not pull a chariot across the sky—the earth revolves on its axis!] Myth, Dawkins keeps repeating, came to be in the days of yore because of an ignorance not through our own fault. We weren’t capable then of the best answers to our questions, not yet. But to continue believing in these myths [i.e., religion]—to accept them as fact, despite the evidence that science offers—despite science assiduously, even gleefully, searching for the answers—just makes one a dodo. (That’s the Dawkins I know.)Dawkins wants me to raise a skeptical child—yes, I’d like to keep this in my shelves, within easy reach of some little monster, eventually. A child who believes in fact, embraces speculations, but relies on logic, evidence, and common sense—without sacrificing an imagination that’s the very foundation of these vast myths he’s dismissively disassembled. A child who’d rather lose himself in the wonder of reality, one ceaselessly amazing because it what is true. (It’s why I like science so much: It assuages your curiosity, and it keeps reminding you how everything makes sense, because the world has rules—serendipity that abounds, the awe-inspiring logic of different grades of intricacy.)Well, at least I hope that’s what he wants. Either way, that’s what I plan to do to little creatures—the gods be willing, and all that jazz. In the meantime, I’m happy to do that myself. [ETA: I admit to rethinking this read-to-a-young’un thing. See, when I was a child, I read this kid's encyclopedia that talked about how the sun would burn itself up, how all life would suffer as a consequence, how everything would subsequently perish. ""In a billion years"" was not a consolation. I carried that knowledge inside me for so long, and I couldn't tell anyone because they were supposed to already know.]A tip: If you’re going to get one for keeps, do find the hardcover copy I have, the one that’s sure to have Dave McKean’s breathtakingly clever illustrations in color. This would have been less of a fun book if it weren’t for the art. Dave McKean, and a science delivered—argued—by Dawkins? Delicious. Just brain-hurty deliciousness."
920,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8795422-william,4,Richard Dawkins is an accomplished scientist with many esteemed publications. He is also a well known apologist for the atheist community. What he has attempted in this book is the debunking of religious explanations for natural phenomenon and the promotion of scientific solutions to those same mysteries. He did an admiral job covering his topic but I must admit I did not feel any magic. He would alternate between a religious or mythological explanation of the big questions of existence then offer sciences take on the subject. In terms of the science he has essentially presented us with an elementary science textbook which covers a wide array of subjects while steering away from the more complicated topics. He makes the mistake of chiding the religious fundamentalist for their views on the sanctity of their beliefs when he doesn't need to. I feel they will fall apart of their own accord. I recommend this book simply because it is written in Dawkins clear and engaging prose. I don't think it will draw too many fundamentalistsu away from the comfort of their beliefs but it does carry on with the triumph of the age of reason.

With  The Magic of Reality, biologist and writer Richard Dawkins explores the scientific method, the difference between reality and magic, and looks for the answers to some of life’s most imminent questions (“Who was the first person?”, “What are things made of?”, “When and how did everything begin?”, etc.).Each chapter starts off with a main question that needs answering, followed by a mythical story used to explain said question in older times, and then followed up with the actual scientific answer. The tone is light and easy to understand, and it’s a perfect book for curious kids who want to know how the world/the universe works but aren’t ready for adult science books yet. As such, it doesn’t go too deep into scientific theory – not a problem in my opinion, since it’s more than enough for kids and will get that wow-teach-me-more-about-science!-spark burning anyway.Next to finding the scientific answers to a couple of very interesting questions, one of Dawkins’ main points is to distinguish between myth, magic, and make-believe, and the actual reality that can be mapped through scientific experiments. He emphasises critical and sceptical thinking, showing how the scientific method is a much better way of approaching and solving problems than just making up stories about some gods up in the sky. And as always, he also notes that reality itself, uncovered through and by science, is already magical and fantastical enough in and of itself – we don’t even need those mythological stories. Hence, the title.As of now, I doubt anybody is unaware of Dawkins’ stance on religion, and though his dislike of it does seep through a little (foolish humans always using silly stories to explain naturally occurring phenomena when they could be using science!), it isn’t as obvious as usual. Probably because the group this book is aimed towards is a little younger than Dawkins’ standard audience. Anyhow, it didn’t bother me nor did I feel he was making fun of myths in general – all he seemed to be saying was that they provide an outdated view.I’m all for making kids enthusiastic about science, and this book definitely does that. As an adult, it was an enjoyable read for me as well – the light tone and passion of it shine through."
922,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5622607-jukka-s-rkij-rvi,4,"Let me begin by saying that I did not, to my knowledge, read the best edition of the book. The edition I read was a small mass-market paperback, and Dave McKean's doubtlessly beautiful artwork was reduced to smudged greyscale thumbnails that would not have done justice to Martínez's Ecce Homo. It is the only major flaw I can find in the book.The Magic of Reality is written for a pre-teen audience, which is reflected in the language. However, the simple, handholding approach works for an older reader as well, especially in the case of some of the more complex concepts.Here, Dawkins walks the reader through such myriad basic science topics as evolution, genetics, the change of seasons and motion of the planets. Most of the content was already familiar to me, but I am not a scientist, so even there my understanding was deepened. To me, the big thing in the book was the explanation of the function of the spectroscope, redshifting and how the date of the Big Bang was arrived to. Fascinating stuff.Dawkins also displays humility in the occasional admission that this or that thing is outside of his area of expertise and even he does not understand it. Quantum physics springs to mind. However, he commits a significant linguistic gaffe by listing the languages of Romansch, Galician, Occitan and Catalan as dialects, which is linguistically suspect and comes with enough political baggage to choke a horse. Hell, Romansch is an official language in Switzerland, fulfilling even the armey un flot definition. Not much of a flot, admittedly, but it exists.Each chapter of the book opens with a series of mythical tales from around the world, illustrating the history of attempts to explain where we come from, where we're going, or what's that big shiny thing up there in the sky. These are occasionally interesting, but by and large, it is my feeling that Dawkins is at his best when he stays out of the humanities and in the hard sciences, where his expertise lies.All told, The Magic of Reality is a quick, entertaining and educational read. Just get the full-colour edition, because doing this to Dave McKean is a crime against art."
923,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This is one of the few books that I would consider comparing to Asimov's writing, particularly for youth. He explains clearly many things about science. This is NOT a book to read if you are religious or believe in astrology, etc! He completely dismisses religion's ability to actually explain things today. I especially liked one of the final chapters dealing with luck. He explains what the law of averages really mean, and why it is silly to assume someone is a lucky or unlucky person or due to have some good luck after a lot of bad luck. He also talks about the impossibility of miracles using a famous one as example. Did I mention you won't like this book if you are religious? He covers a LOT of basic science. In fact I was thinking that the book could easily be used by a middle grade science teacher as one of the textbooks. Probably not the only textbook since by the general nature of covering quite a few different branches of science, a lot of it is not in depth science. He also gives you a way of evaluating whether something is believable, which would be useful for many of us. He is passionate that not only is science the proper way to view the world, it is also the most beautiful, magical way to view the world. He uses the definition of magic as poetic in the title. If you have youngsters, particularly if you live in a conservative, religious area that is limiting what science can be taught, this book is a must to buy, read and discuss with those youngsters! It may also have the effect of helping kids to realize how fascinating science is and consider taking it up as a career!"
924,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12809503-david-powell,5,"Having read some of the other reviews, I think that some people have the wrong perception of this excellent book. I am not sure that some of the reviewers even got the point of the book. It is not an introduction to science for children no matter how it was advertised. While is is true that the book seems somewhat condescending at times to anyone with some knowledge of science, it is a delineation between what is mythology and what is science (or fact). If one thinks about it, religion happens to be the particular mythology that any given person believes in. For this reason, the crushing challenge that Dawkins brings against religion's explanations for why things are is likely to step upon people's spiritual toes. Every mythology has its roots, in my opinion, in primitive people's need to know about first cause, natural events, and life and death. A simple exercise in imagination can see some primitive people approaching a tribal chief or witchdoctor with exactly those questions, and to extend the image further, the chief or witchdoctor, to maintain his credibility, has to quickly come up with clever, engaging explanations for why we die or why the sun comes up in the morning. My guess it that every mythology began this way. I would bet that Dawkins would agree. You will be, to be sure, reschooled in science, but you will be given a chance to see how silly primitive myths are in today's world. (I read the paperback version which apparently lacks much of the illustration that was discussed in earlier reviews of the hardback version.)"
925,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5923392-diana,5,"Might be my favorite Dawkins book so far. It's certainly the only one I finished in under 24 hrs.I absolutely adored the last 2 chapters about probability and miracles. I laughed out loud in a public place when I got to the lone Scotsman practicing the bagpipes. I have previously read The God Delusion, The Selfish Gene, The Ancestor's Tale, and The Blind Watchmaker, and they had left me thinking that Dawkins' strengths lie in explaining biology and debating political/sociological issues, but that his divergence towards physics or related fields were not as successful. While his biology for example left me fascinated, his explanations of physics concepts are usually understandable but very barren. In this book, however, Dawkins' talks of the prism and the spectroscope for example were simply mesmerizing. Maybe it's because his target audience was younger people so he had to change his tone from explaining-how-things-work to explaining-why-things-are-awesome and you could feel his excitement for these concepts just like his passion for biology is always palpable.Another lovely thing about this book is Dawkins' treatment of the myth sections. While he usually treats mythology and religion as the unfortunate but inevitable product of evolution and sociology, in his book here, he approached them from an anthropological point of view. While maintaining that they are categorically false and poor explanations for reality, he did give them some respect as nice pieces of culture, literature and history."
926,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30594288-arunbalaji-mohanraj,5,"A wonderful book by Richard Dawkins to explain what is the real science behind everything that we believe as magic. This book is all about the myth that we heard from our childhood in different terms and the real science or reasons behind it. I really liked the chapters where he discussed about who was the first person, what are things made of, what is the sun, rainbow and an earthquake. After reading this book, I got questions within myself about our universe and also understood many facts about our universe especially earth and stars from the other sources. I was really shocked to know that it would take thousands of years to reach our nearest star other than the sun. The evolutionary science explained in this book was quite interesting and he takes us through the biological science as the author is an evolutionary biologist on the chapters related to the first person. Also he well illustrated about the existence of life in other planets in the chapter - ""Are we alone."" Author explained each and every chapters with the myths as well as the science and I really enjoyed the science that came after each and every myths. At the beginning of the book, I felt it as quite boring however after few chapters the book was really interesting and I feel like I should read it once again. I would recommend this book for everyone as there are many interesting facts about our universe that we should know for sure."
927,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40677420-hugh-dunnett,4,"An excellent young adult/introductory guide to major themes in science. Dawkins is a superb writer with a talent for describing scientific topics in a way to make them enjoyable and quite comprehensible to all. The areas of science covered are fairly broad in range but specific enough to allow a genuine developing of understanding. Further to this, Dave McKean’s illustrations are frequently breath-taking and genuinely illuminating. This is as much McKean’s book as it is Dawkins’.The novel idea in this introduction to science is to touch on ancient myths and then to speak of the science, the reality behind the myth. This could have added something of a nuanced and unusual flavour to the book. However I felt that the often rather shoehorned inclusion at the start of most chapters of ancient beliefs and myths, often obscure to the point of being well without the everyday readers’ consciousness doesn’t add much to the later revealed ‘magic’ of the scientific reality. Indeed, the only reason I can see for their inclusion is to build up to the final two chapters which have little to do with scientific method but appear to be included primarily to provide a platform to bash believer and belief. This Dawkins has done comprehensively in previous works and which wasn’t really required in this publication. It is a shame as the book would have been quite perfect without it."
928,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54322403-abdulrahman-alhamali,3,"The Magic or Reality by Richard Dawkins is a book that aims to explain the astonishing world around us through the lens of science. It presents several natural phenomena, and compares their scientific and mythical explanations. I enjoyed the book, and learned a lot of interesting facts, especially about biology, the specialty of Dawkins. But I did not enjoy two things: 1- The parts that were not about biology felt very ""reportive"". They just felt as if someone was telling me a lot of information with minimum explanation. 2- The ""reportive"" style of most of the chapters made the book kind of ironic for me; The book tries very hard to pitch the idea of abandoning religious and mythical explanations, but does that in a very ""religious"" way, where the author just presents facts with minimal explanation, and then says: This is what you should believe, not what you read in the religious books.I believe Dawkins could have done a much better job had he tried to write the book in a format that is more interactive and less reportive, or had he focused more on biology, where he most truly shines."
929,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5038234-dylan-armes,4,"After finishing this book, I told my wife we're finally ready to have kids, now that this book is around.Written at a junior high level, this was Richard Dawkins' attempt to write a book of general science that answers a lot of common questions from kids. Questions like ""How do we know how far away things are in space?"" or ""Where did the dinosaurs go?""Love him or hate him, there's no denying that Professor Dawkins is a master of explaining difficult-to-grasp scientific concepts. Though I felt like I understood everything in the book pretty well before going through it, his explanations were all very easy to understand and well-argued.Each chapter of this book begins with some sort of mythology story, from all over the world. Dawkins focuses on how different peoples and different religions answer questions in various supernatural ways, and how now science can give us the answers that people have been searching for all this time. This book is not an attack on religion, like his most famous work: The God Delusion. Rather, it's like his less famous, but overall much better The Selfish Gene, or The Greatest Show on Earth. I recommend this book to everyone over the age of 10. At the VERY LEAST, it will make you think. And you will likely end up with a deeper understanding of fundamental scientific concepts. "

There is something for everyone in it. My personal favorite was the chapter on rainbows. I definitely learned a lot.

1050,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15482223-frank-guerra,3,"Dawkins is indeed brilliant, although he has a tendency to talk down to people like they are stupid. Parts of this book read like a highschool chemistry textbook. That being said, I do like that the book is in mostly layman's terms. It is accessible to the masses and very direct. There is something for everyone in it. My personal favorite was the chapter on rainbows. I definitely learned a lot. While not the brooding, brilliant, passionate work that Hitchens' ""God is Not Great"" is, Dawkins' ""Magic of Reality"" is a short easy read, and well worth spending a few hours with."
1051,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11418486-eugene-yu,4,"This pretty much answers situations to what most fanatically religious people believe in , but there are a lot of things we don't know yet in which science has not been able to solve, i mean the universe is a vast place of the unknown, and people tend to invent superstitious notions and beliefs because its easier than trying to understand scientific concepts that are way to difficult to understand. A must read for everyone into evidence-based science. i am beginning to like richard dawkins' collection of books, and i am looking forward to reading them in the future. "
1052,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79446219-brodie,5,"Dawkins takes the most fascinating, mysterious and wondrous concepts and explains them in a way that an literate person could understand. His ability to use logic and science is admirable and his ability to make that seem magical is something I admire of him. I recommend that everybody read this book"

So fundamental and so elegant ."
1054,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18903703-eric,5,"It's Richard Dawkins explaining science very simply and engagingly. It's very good. It's written for a little younger audience but I still highly recommend it for anyone interested in science and biology. I learned all kinds of fascinating things, like who knows how rainbows work? I do!! And now I know how we know how old the universe is, how earthquakes work, and I have a better understanding of evolution, as well. Very well explained. I'm very happy. :)"

This book is just a explanation for few questions such as Who is the first man, why we have sun and moon, which is the first animal. The author gives the answers in two ways. The first he give myth answer and he explains through science how it really happens.I actually misunderstood the title, I thought that this would be to fine the reality of the decision that we would take, So it took a long time for me to finish this book :( "
1056,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4143488-jan,4,"Eloquent, kind and hearty introduction to reality not only for youngsters or young adults. I havent seen the harback illustrations though. I can only imagine that Dave McKeans illustrated explanations of rainbow brings a whole new dimensions to the easy going lecture. If you are bored by your everyday job, dont have time to study or read science 101, and still wonder what is stuff made of, and how come you never reach the end of rainbow - pick up The Magic of Reality and enjoy the real magic."
1057,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2322357-lani-m,5,"Great job, Dawkins, this book is clearly the greatest science introduction to mankind. Everyone must read this book at least once in their lives. Been sitting in my collection since 2013 and I keep going back and forth the pages every now and then because the illustrations are damn good and the explanations sound like a fairy tale, only these are the realities presented to you by the magic of science."

It should be mandatory reading in every middle school science class to help children see the big picture in the concepts they explore, create a coherent vision of science rather than a siloed understanding of physics, chemistry and science and help them contrast real life myths with the magic of reality. My daughter who started it in 6th grade found it hard to get through but I'm hoping that she will be able to pick it up again soon. "

A great book on how the natural world works, occasionally dropping in some amazing facts or jokes. 4/5 because the book is written for teenager readers, parts of the book were obvious to me, so I ended up skimming through them. "
1060,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5108161-laura-jones,3,"This book was enjoyable as long as you can imagine yourself as a child. The things you learn are things children are learning. It's a magical book, with myths at the beginning of the chapters, which are proven wrong in the end of the chapter by showing how science explains what happened. It was a fun read, and your children would enjoy it."
1061,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4981114-kirsten,5,"Gorgeous book, full of information that I can't wait to share with my kids, but they are not old enough yet! I love the way he has organized this book, by presenting the mythic explanation for a topic, and then following it up with the real explanation. A very effective way to convey the magic of reality in contrast to fable, as the title states."
1062,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14964120-derek,5,"Bravo, Professor Dawkins! This book was excellent. Some topics are quite simple but he makes them very interesting. I learned a lot of neat stuff. Most chapters start out with varying myths and theological stories and then followed up by real, raw science. Mr. Dawkins makes science a lot of fun and wondrous in this book. I think everyone should read this!"

Most chapters begin with stories and myths from around the world, and then go into clearly explained scientific explanations for what is really true as proven by science. It also features very interesting and colorful pictures throughout the book depicting what Dawkins is describing. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone! "
1065,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17794369,4,"This was a bit out of Dawkins' usual area(Biology/Evolution) and also adorned with his infamous repetitive sentences. But I have to admit this was way much simpler and easier on the eyes than his other behemoths. The structure of the chapters, the mythbusting parts and simple way he explains natural phenomena is really charming. "
1066,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4023338-nickh,3,"This is a science book for people who know nothing about science. There is some good information but it is very very basic stuff. Not for anyone with more than a rudimentary understanding of physics, biology or chemistry."

1069,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2150397-dana,5,This small book is a good start to Richard Dawkins books. I liked how the author started by writing about the myth or miracle then finished up with the scientific explanation. The most chapters that I enjoyed are the once related to biology.
