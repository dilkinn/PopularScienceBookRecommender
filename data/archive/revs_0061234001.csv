0,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934648-jim,1,"This was an interesting book. I say it was interesting because I started liking it (a lot) when I first read it, as time passed I liked it less and less. In that way I call it a candy book, tastes good at first but leaves you worse off for reading it. In my opinion, there are two problems with the book: First, Stephen Dubner comes across as a sycophant. Way to much of the book is spent praising Levitt. Secondly, I was disappointed in the lack of detail provided about Livitt's hypothesis. I wanted more. It was like reading War and Peace and discovering that you read the abridged version and in fact the book wasn't 100 pages long. This disappointment may have come from my engineering background and my strong desire to really understand economics. This book didn't offer any of that, only a titillating glimpse of the economics. In some regards one may think my single start rating is to harsh. As mind candy this book was quite good. I did enjoy reading it at the time. Whats more, it did encourage me to study real economics. I am currently enrolled in a masters program in economics and this book did play a very small roll in that decision process. However, as I learn more about economics I realize how shallow the book in fact was. While this is not the forum for a comprehensive review of the topics presented in the book, or an analysis of how good the economics in Freekanomics are, a review in ""Journal of Economic Literature (Vol XLV, Dec. 2007 pp 973)"" quotes Livitt as saying: ""There is no question I have written some ridiculous papers."" The article then goes on to quote a paper by Noam Scheibler(2007) describing Livitt's comparing some of his papers to the fashion industry. ""Sometimes you write papers and they're less about the actual result, more about your vision of how you think the profession should be. And so I think some of my most ridiculous papers actually fall in the high-fashion category."""
1,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/154731-rachel,2,"Sure, this book was a compelling read that offered us all some great amo for cocktail party conversation. But ultimately I think most of what Leavitt claims is crap. He dodges accoutability with the disclaimer about his book NOT being a scholarly work, but then goes on to drop statistics, theories and expert opinions. These assertions laid, he doesn't provide readers with enough information to critically examine his perspectives.Ultimately I have a problem with the unquestioned, unaccoutable role of the public intellectual. Leavitt dances around with his PhD on his sleeve, but is never subject to peer review or any sort of academic criticism. I think it's irresponsible. "
2,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"I loved this book, though I think the title is a bit misleading. It's not really about economics. In fact, he's showing you what interesting things you can discover when you apply statistical analysis to problems where you wouldn't normally think of using it. I use statistical methods a fair amount in my own work, so I found it particularly interesting. The most startling and thought-provoking example is definitely the unexpected reduction in US urban crime that occurred towards the end of the 20th century. Crime rates had been rising for decades, and people were really worried about what would happen if the trend continued. Then, suddenly, they peaked and started to decline. Why? There were a bunch of theories, all of them superficially plausible.Levitt crunched the numbers, to see what proportion of the variance could be ascribed to the different factors. This is a completely standard technique; it just hadn't been used here before. He came to the conclusion that the single most important factor, by far, was the ready availability of abortion that started to come in after Roe v Wade. Other things, like more resources for policing and tougher sentencing policies, probably helped, but not nearly as much. I didn't at all get the impression that he had been expecting this result from the start, and just wanted to prove his point. He processed the data, and went where the numbers led him. That's how you're supposed to do science.The clincher, at least as far as I was concerned, was the fact that crime statistics peaked at different points in different states, the peaks correlating very well with the dates when each state started making abortion available. States that brought it in early had correspondingly early peaks in their crime rates. It's hard to see how that could happen if Levitt's explanation weren't correct.I am surprised that there hasn't been more discussion of Levitt's findings in the political world. Maybe it's just regarded as too hot to handle. But if Levitt is right, and at the moment I would say it's up to his critics to explain why he isn't, then pro-life campaigners would seem be heading in a very unfortunate direction."

Levitt and Dubner and probably the kind of smart arse nerds who snigger at you because you don't understand linux but sneer at you because you've actually spoken to a woman. This book is much like the Emperor's New Clothes, people are so scared about being left out if they don't like or understand it because some sandal wearing hippy in the Guardian said it's 'This year's Das Capital' or some such bollocks that they feel compelled to join some sort of unspoken club where they all jizz themselves silly over a book that effectively is 300+ pages of pure condescension.Only buy this book if a facist regime ever seizes control of your country and instigates a book burning policy."
4,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33765-justin,4,"I guess some people don't like this book because it's not centered around one theme. Instead, it's more about the seemingly diffuse academic work of one of the authors Steven D. Levitt (the other author is a journalist, Stephen J. Dubner). Levitt is something of an economist but more like a social scientist using the tools of Microeconomics applied to other fields that happen to catch his interest (often having something to do with cheating, corruption, crime, etc.). In the back of the book he mentions how he considers himself a student of Thomas Schelling who is kind of like the father of Game Theory (strategy theory?), except much more of a 'man of ideas' than what one might think of when one thinks about game theory today, which is much more mathematical. Anyway, as for the book itself, I thought it was really great. I really like what Levitt is doing as far as using the tools of Microeconomics in other fields. One of my intellectual heroes (I only have a few) is Kenneth Waltz who did the exact same thing in the field of International Relations in the '70's and wrote the seminal book The Theory of International Politics, which pretty much the single-handedly invented defensive (neo) realism. More generally, I think Economics is probably the most formalized of the social sciences and the one to which others should esteem. A lot of the Political Science field concerned with both voter behavior and how legislatures work is now pretty formalized as well, and, I, for one, think this is a good thing. I don't see how anyone could think it's not (good) unless they a)think the scientific method cannot be used to analyze human behavior; or b)have a visceral aversion to mathematical languages. Actually, I am one of the latter, but I, at least, see the value in having a formalized language to work with.As for the book itself, there's some maybe-controversial things in there like Levitt did some work that showed that the legalization of abortion in the U.S. (Roe v. Wade) was one of the main reasons that crime in the U.S. dropped in the '90's and continues at the same rates today. He stands behind it pretty hardily though and it doesn't seem like he has a moral agenda at all. Some might argue that the best writers are those who are best able to disguise their moral agenda, but considering he writes about all kinds of not-very-serious things like how sumo wrestling in Japan is probably corrupt as far as matches g,o and there's stuff in there about how real estate agents sell their houses for more than they sell their customers' houses (which, may or may not be surprising), I really don't think he has a hidden pro-life agenda. Anyway, there's a bunch of stuff in there (the book), hence the 'freak' in Freakonomics. It's well-written. It's not dry. It's written for a lay audience. I recommend it. Read it and feel the power of social science! ;-)"
5,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-cristina-monica,3,"Interesting enough, but the exponential amount of data made it hard to remember what the initial claims of the economist were instead of reinforcing them, strangely! I did, however, learn from this book. It still amazes me that the way to reduce crime seems to be the legalization of abortion. I did not expect that, but it does make quite a lot of sense and I’m all for women having control over their own bodies and futures, of course. Sidenote: I despised the author’s arbitrary uses of female and male pronouns. Like, a teacher is a SHE and then an architect a HE? That certainly didn’t gain my respect."
6,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34789720-cbzlqxw,1,"Well,this is the most terrible book I have ever seen,it was too terrible to read.It’s so terrible that I just want to burn it as fast as I can,and it cost me 58RMB.That was 58RMB,it was to expensive for me to afford.At first.I thought it was a good book,and I spend all my money on this book.And I was pretty annoyed about this I don’t have any other money for my breakfast,lunch,and even dinner.I haven’t drink juice for the whole year.Reading this is a waste of time,no one want to see this book again.It was just rubbish,and smelly book.It tells my nothing.I even want to sell this to the writer,and ask to return my money and some extra.It cost me too much time,and too much money on it.I prefer to see a movie instead!!!"
7,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1794887-cwn-annwn-13,1,"I assumed Freakonomics would be a book that used statistics to debunk various societal hysterias and fearmongering in a semi-humorous way. I quickly realized what I was in for when early in the book when the authors gave their background as Harvard Jews and profiled a guy that infiltrated the KKK for the ADL. The story sounds at least partially made up. It then jumped into predictable white guilt inducing trash and goes into mental contortions using ""data"" and sociological explanations for black criminality and low IQ scores. The writers of this book are also obsessively pro-Abortion. The only surprise was they used statistics to show you are much more likely to die from an automobile or a swimming pool than a gun. This book would probably appeal to upper middle class liberals who like to consider themselves clever and politically astute from their isolated armchairs. For me Freakonomics was a big load of garbage."
8,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,5,"Extremely enlightening! Worthy of 15 stars out of 5! This is a book about the world and not about any science in particular. It's about learning to question the given and see beyond the obvious. An extremely useful gift in the misguiding modern world.Yeah, populistic much too much but neverthless compulsively readable. A definite revisit and reread.Q:As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions. His particular gift is the ability to ask such questions. For instance: If drug dealers make so much money, why do they still live with their mothers? Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What really caused crime rates to plunge during the past decade? Do real-estate agents have their clients’ best interests at heart? Why do black parents give their children names that may hurt their career prospects? Do schoolteachers cheat to meet high-stakes testing standards? Is sumo wrestling corrupt?And how does a homeless man in tattered clothing afford $50 headphones?(c)Q:the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and—if the right questions are asked—is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking.(c)Q:“Experts”—from criminologists to real-estate agents-use their informational advantage to serve their own agenda. However, they can be beat at their own game. And in the face of the Internet, their informational advantage is shrinking every day-as evidenced by, among other things, the falling price of coffins and life-insurance premiums.Knowing what to measure and how to measure it makes a complicated world much less so. If you learn how to look at data in the right way, you can explain riddles that otherwise might have seemed impossible. Because there is nothing like the sheer power of numbers to scrub away layers of confusion and contradiction.So the aim of this book is to explore the hidden side of . . . everything. This may occasionally be a frustrating exercise. It may sometimes feel as if we are peering at the world through a straw or even staring into a funhouse mirror; but the idea is to look at many different scenarios and examine them in a way they have rarely been examined....Steven Levitt may not fully believe in himself, but he does believe in this: teachers and criminals and real-estate agents may lie, and politicians, and even CIA analysts. But numbers don’t.(c)Q:Levitt had an interview for the Society of Fellows, the venerable intellectual clubhouse atHarvard that pays young scholars to do their own work, for three years, with no commitments.Levitt felt he didn’t stand a chance. For starters, he didn’t consider himself an intellectual. He wouldbe interviewed over dinner by the senior fellows, a collection of world-renowned philosophers,scientists, and historians. He worried he wouldn’t have enough conversation to last even the firstcourse.Disquietingly, one of the senior fellows said to Levitt, “I’m having a hard time seeing theunifying theme of your work. Could you explain it?”Levitt was stymied. He had no idea what his unifying theme was, or if he even had one.Amartya Sen, the future Nobel-winning economist, jumped in and neatly summarized what hesaw as Levitt’s theme.Yes, Levitt said eagerly, that’s my theme.Another fellow then offered another theme.You’re right, said Levitt, my theme.And so it went, like dogs tugging at a bone, until the philosopher Robert Nozick interrupted.“How old are you, Steve?” he asked.“Twenty-six.”Nozick turned to the other fellows: “He’s twenty-six years old. Why does he need to have aunifying theme? Maybe he’s going to be one of those people who’s so talented he doesn’t need one.He’ll take a question and he’ll just answer it, and it’ll be fine.”(c)Q:There are three basic flavors of incentive: economic, social, and moral. Very often a single incentive scheme will include all three varieties. Think about the anti-smoking campaign of recent years. The addition of a $3-per-pack “sin tax” is a strong economic incentive against buying cigarettes. The banning of cigarettes in restaurants and bars is a powerful social incentive. And when the U.S. government asserts that terrorists raise money by selling black-market cigarettes, that acts as a rather jarring moral incentive.Some of the most compelling incentives yet invented have been put in place to deter crime. Considering this fact, it might be worthwhile to take a familiar question—why is there so much crime in modern society?—and stand it on its head: why isn’t there a lot more crime? After all, every one of us regularly passes up opportunities to maim, steal, and defraud. The chance of going to jail—thereby losing your job, your house, and your freedom, all of which are essentially economic penalties—is certainly a strong incentive. But when it comes to crime, people also respond to moral incentives (they don’t want to do something they consider wrong) and social incentives (they don’t want to be seen by others as doing something wrong). For certain types of misbehavior, social incentives are terribly powerful. In an echo of Hester Prynne’s scarlet letter, many American cities now fight prostitution with a “shaming” offensive, posting pictures of convicted johns (and prostitutes) on websites or on local-access television. Which is a more horrifying deterrent: a $500 fine for soliciting a prostitute or the thought of your friends and family ogling you on www.HookersAndJohns.com.(с)Q:Some cheating leaves barely a shadow of evidence. In other cases, the evidence is massive.Consider what happened one spring evening at midnight in 1987: seven million American childrensuddenly disappeared. The worst kidnapping wave in history? Hardly. It was the night of April 15,and the Internal Revenue Service had just changed a rule. Instead of merely listing each dependentchild, tax filers were now required to provide a Social Security number for each child. Suddenly,seven million children—children who had existed only as phantom exemptions on the previousyear’s 1040 forms—vanished, representing about one in ten of all dependent children in the UnitedStates(c)Q:Of all the ideas that Kennedy had thought up—and would think up in the future—to fight bigotry, his Superman campaign was easily the cleverest and probably the most productive. It had the precise effect he hoped: turning the Klan’s secrecy against itself, converting precious knowledgeinto ammunition for mockery. Instead of roping in millions of members as it had just a generationearlier, the Klan lost momentum and began to founder. Although the Klan would never quite die,especially down South—David Duke, a smooth-talking Klan leader from Louisiana, mountedlegitimate bids for the U.S. Senate and other offices—it was also never quite the same. In The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America, the historian Wyn Craig Wade calls Stetson Kennedy “the single most important factor in preventing a postwar revival of the Ku Klux Klan in the North.”This did not happen because Kennedy was courageous or resolute or unflappable, even though he was all of these. It happened because Kennedy understood the raw power of information. The Ku Klux Klan was a group whose power—much like that of politicians or real-estate agents or stockbrokers—was derived in large part from the fact that it hoarded information. Once that information falls into the wrong hands (or, depending on your point of view, the right hands), much of the group’s advantage disappears.(с)Q:Information is so powerful that the assumption of information, even if the information does not actually exist, can have a sobering effect.(c)Q:It is common for one party to a transaction to have better information than another party. Inthe parlance of economists, such a case is known as an information asymmetry. We accept as averity of capitalism that someone (usually an expert) knows more than someone else (usually aconsumer). (c)Q:If you were to assume that many experts use their information to your detriment, you’d beright. Experts depend on the fact that you don’t have the information they do. Or that you are sobefuddled by the complexity of their operation that you wouldn’t know what to do with theinformation if you had it. Or that you are so in awe of their expertise that you wouldn’t darechallenge them. If your doctor suggests that you have angioplasty—even though some currentresearch suggests that angioplasty often does little to prevent heart attacks—you aren’t likely tothink that the doctor is using his informational advantage to make a few thousand dollars forhimself or his buddy. But as David Hillis, an interventional cardiologist at the University of TexasSouthwestern Medical Center in Dallas, explained to the New York Times, a doctor may have thesame economic incentives as a car salesman or a funeral director or a mutual fund manager: “Ifyou’re an invasive cardiologist and Joe Smith, the local internist, is sending you patients, and if youtell them they don’t need the procedure, pretty soon Joe Smith doesn’t send patients anymore.”(c)Q:Consider this true story, related by John Donohue, a law professor who in 2001 was teaching at Stanford University: “I was just about to buy a house on the Stanford campus,” he recalls, “and the seller’s agent kept telling me what a good deal I was getting because the market was about to zoom. As soon as I signed the purchase contract, he asked me if I would need an agent to sell my previous Stanford house. I told him that I would probably try to sell without an agent, and he replied, ‘John, that might work under normal conditions, but with the market tanking now, you really need the help of a broker.’”Within five minutes, a zooming market had tanked. Such are the marvels that can be conjured by an agent in search of the next deal.(c)Q:They were also a lot richer, taller, skinnier, and better-looking than average. That, at least, is what they wrote about themselves. More than 4 percent of the online daters claimed to earn more than $200,000 a year, whereas fewer than 1 percent of typical Internet users actually earn that much, suggesting that three of the four big earners were exaggerating. Male and female users typically reported that they are about an inch taller than the national average. As for weight, the men were in line with the national average, but the women typically said they weighed about twenty pounds less than the national average.Most impressively, fully 70 percent of the women claimed “above average” looks, including 24 percent claiming “very good looks.” The online men too were gorgeous: 67 percent called themselves “above average,” including 21 percent with “very good looks.” This leaves only about 30 percent of the users with “average” looks, including a paltry 1 percent with “less than average” looks—which suggests that the typical online dater is either a fabulist, a narcissist, or simply resistant to the meaning of “average.” (Or perhaps they are all just realists: as any real-estate agent knows, the typical house isn’t “charming” or “fantastic,” but unless you say it is, no one will even bother to take a look.) Twenty-eight percent of the women on the site said they were blond, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dyeing, or lying, or both. Some users, meanwhile, were bracingly honest. Eight percent of the men—about 1 in every 12 conceded that they were married, with half of these 8 percent reporting that they were “happily married.” But the fact that they were honest doesn’t mean they were rash. Of the 258 “happily married” men in the sample, only 9 chose to post a picture of themselves. The reward of gaining a mistress was evidently outweighed by the risk of having your wife discover your personal ad. (c)Q:But if there is no unifying theme to Freakonomics, there is at least a common thread running through the everyday application of Freakonomics. It has to do with thinking sensibly about how people behave in the real world. All it requires is a novel way of looking, of discerning, of measuring. This isn’t necessarily a difficult task, nor does it require supersophisticated thinking. We have essentially tried to figure out what the typical gang member or sumo wrestler figured out on his own (although we had to do so in reverse).Will the ability to think such thoughts improve your life materially? Probably not. Perhaps you’ll put up a sturdy gate around your swimming pool or push your real-estate agent to work a little harder. But the net effect is likely to be more subtle than that. You might become more skeptical of the conventional wisdom; you may begin looking for hints as to how things aren’t quite what they seem; perhaps you will seek out some trove of data and sift through it, balancing your intelligence and your intuition to arrive at a glimmering new idea. Some of these ideas might make you uncomfortable, even unpopular. To claim that legalized abortion resulted in a massive drop in crime will inevitably lead to explosive moral reactions. (c)"

Pretty interesting how much he dislikes criminologists but then (if I remember correctly), only mentions the same one or two names over and over when giving examples of criminologists that had agendas/tricked the public. Also the fact that the entire book, and the issues, feels very simplified. Actually the author puts it best himself: ""The typical parenting expert, like experts in other fields, is prone to sound exceedingly sure of himself. An expert doesn’t so much argue the various sides of an issue, as plant his flag firmly on one side. That’s because an expert who’s argument reeks of restraint or nuance often doesn’t get much attention. An expert must be bold if he hopes to alchemise (?) his homespun theory into conventional wisdom."" This is often how I perceived the book to be written, very simplified, without enough nuance or room for possible explanations - only one right answer. I didn't like how the book was written, how the topics where dealt with, and had a hard time taking anything seriously after all of the self-admiration and the repeated ""all experts have agendas (except for us)"" talk in every chapter.

15,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,3,"I won't deny that this is a very interesting, compelling and thought-provoking book. Even for someone like me whose general response to economics is *snore*. And it's mainly because Freakonomics is not really about economics, but involves applying statistical analysis to many social issues and questions. Very easy to read. Lots of shocking discoveries that seem weighted in fact - Roe v. Wade is responsible for a huge drop in crime? No wonder some people are pissed off with this book. It's really quite fascinating to look at the power of incentives - economic, social and moral - and examine cause and effect. One of my favourite personal experiences with silly notions of cause and effect is diet soft drinks. I confess to being a bit of a coke zero addict. It's not great for you (the sodium makes you more thirsty, a lot of potassium can lead to palpitations, and a lot of phosphoric acid has been linked to kidney problems) but I've lost count of how many times people have cited statistics showing that diet soda drinkers are more likely to be overweight and diabetic. Of course they are! If you're overweight and diabetic you're more likely to drink the low-calorie, sugar-free alternatives, aren't you? So strange how people assume it is A that causes B and ignore the possibility of it being the opposite.Anyway, my issue with this entertaining book is that I think it may be - to be frank - bullshit. Not all of it, sure. But definitely some of it. The writers state their points very confidently (some might say with a touch too much smarm) but it requires you to take a lot of what they say on faith. And some of the jumps they make between statistics and conclusion don't quite add up for me. I know many others have felt the same.But here was the thing that really got me, the thing that made me smell bullshit: I'm fairly confident something they said is not rooted in any truth. And let's be clear: I am a total noob when it comes to most statistics and economics, so if even I can spot something a bit off, it really makes me question the rest of it. Here it is:
Women's rights advocates, for instance, have hyped the incidence of sexual assault, claiming that one in three American women will in her lifetime be a victim of rape or attempted rape. (The actual figure is more like one in eight - but the advocates know it would take a callous person to publicly dispute their claims.)
This, if true, implies two things. 1) Those advocating women's rights are using false data, therefore undermining their credibility, and 2) They have invented a statistic to intentionally support their cause, knowing no one will dispute it (absolutely bizarre that the author thinks no one is disputing women's rights claims, but okay...)Well, being a feminist and someone who has spent an awful lot of time reading and writing about women's rights organizations and statistics, my eyes narrowed a little. See, in all my research, I've never seen or heard any claim that ""1 in 3 women will be a victim of rape or attempted rape"". I have heard the ""1 in 3"" statistic, but a somewhat different one.So, obviously, I went to look it up. I spent a couple of hours going through Google and every women's rights organization page I could find, trying to uncover a single case where that statistic was used. I found exactly: none. The only other thing I found that mentioned it was a Time article attempting to debunk so-called ""feminist myths"": http://time.com/3222543/5-feminist-my...The statistic the authors appear to have misquoted is that ""1 in 3 women will experience sexual violence, or physical violence by an intimate partner"", which is used often. Sexual violence here is an ambiguous term, leaving room for wider interpretations and probably explaining why, with the addition of domestic violence into the statistic, the number is at ""1 in 3"" instead of ""1 in 8"". Furthermore, not only have the authors misrepresented the statistical claim itself, but they have also suggested that women's rights advocates have pulled the numbers from thin air to make a point - on the contrary, this is a study conducted by the World Health Organization on the ""Global and regional estimates of violence against women"".I like the idea of the book, but this really put me off. Perhaps it was a one-off error that I managed to spot. Perhaps. Either way, I started to be less impressed by the facts and statistics they presented. Still, very enjoyable book for the most part."

17,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675162-j-l-sutton,3,"I enjoyed Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner’s Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything; however, I’m not yet sure if it is simply entertaining or is in any way instructive. Levitt and Dubner explore a diverse range of subjects: from linking Roe v. Wade to violent crime, cheating by teachers and sumo wrestlers to an economic model of drug dealing. I’d like to think that the stories told by the authors and the way they analyze conventional thinking would put me on a path to look past easy answers. Having completed Freakonomics, do I look at the world radically differently than I did before picking up the book? It is Interesting to look at subjects from a different angle. Positing that economics and specifically the field of study now dubbed freakonomics has nothing to do with morality is an intriguing concept as well, but deciding which stories to tell is necessarily selective. Indeed, the focus is interesting. So yes I enjoyed Freakonomics, but feel I should have more to say about it and the authors’ underlying premises than I do. 3.25 stars "
18,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2926986-michael,1,"Verbose, repetitive, contradictory: a book of 200-pages that could be condensed to 3-5 pages. Titles that vary from scintillating to insulting, yet are followed by a chapter that doesn't support the title bar. Anecdotal stories, mistaken for data or hypothesis. Interpretations and hypotheses are drawn from data that could still be interpreted in multiple ways.The book claims that it will link the unexpected, but frankly, links the obvious, with many ""well duh"" moments.Needless generations of lists that help bulk out the book, but provide little further benefit for study.Each chapter begins with unnecessary aggrandisement of the author for the statistician, that jars the flow of the book.Overall, a good demonstration of why ""social sciences"" are in no way close to being ""science"", and instead should be termed social philosophy."

(The actual figure is more like one in eight-but the advocates know it would take a callous person to dispute their claim.)""In the Notes for this chapter:""The 2002 statistics from the National Crime Survey, which is designed to elicit honest responses, suggests that the lifetime risk of a woman's being the victim of unwanted sexual activity or attempted unwanted sexual activity is one in eight[.]""Here, in a nutshell, is how the National Crime VICTIMIZATION Survey collects information on rape:Every six months, they ask everyone over 12 in a bunch of houses questions like:""41a.(Other than any incidents already mentioned,) has anyone attacked or threatened you in any of these ways -(e) Any rape, attempted rape or other type of sexual attack -""Followed up later with:""29c.You mentioned rape. Do you mean forced or coerced sexual intercourse?""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the flaws in the NCVS's methodology here. And to use it to glibly accuse ""women's rights advocates"" of somehow manipulating a kowtowed public is incredibly obnoxious. While I'd guess that Levitt might be right more often than wrong, it's not worth his smug, self-satisfied style. I recommend 'Bad Science' by Ben Goldacre. Similar schtick with substance instead of 'hype'. "

21,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/972904-jake,2,"The Basics:Freakonomics isn’t really about any one thing, which makes it a bit hard to summarize. In essence, it’s economist Steven Levitt playing around with economic principles and basic statistical analysis to examine various cultural trends and phenomena. He tackles a variety of questions, from whether or not sumo wrestlers cheat (they do) to whether or not a child’s name determines his success (it doesn’t). He does this all through examining statistics and data, trying to find facts to back up various assertions rather than relying on conventional wisdom.The Good:As a person who is sick of the inability of most people to have a rational discourse on any even vaguely politicized topic, and a self-proclaimed skeptic, it’s nice to read anyone who endorses looking at hard data to make judgments about possibly controversial issues. Levitt does a nice job of not only proclaiming the advantages of this sort of rational outlook, but also of showing that when you actually examine the data, you sometimes get surprising results. Furthermore, he takes the time to point out that there is a difference between correlation and causation, and that many people mistake one for the other. Again, a nice touch.The actual questions that Levitt asks are all fairly interesting, though some will appeal to certain readers more than others. In addition to cheating sumotori and strange names, Levitt also examines cheating teachers, the economics of crack dealers, and the effect of abortion on crime. Crime, in point of fact, seems to be Levitt’s greatest interest, and I wonder if he might not have been better served by writing an entire book on the relationship between economics and crime, as opposed to trying to touch on a number of different subjects that are all largely unrelated. It might have made for a tighter, more focused book.The writing is solid; simple and easy, but solid. Despite being a book about economics, it’s not a terribly dense read, as witnessed by the fact that I finished it off in about two days. Granted, it was two days of heavy reading, but it was still two days.The Bad:For a book that’s so gung ho about statistics, there aren’t many statistics in here. Levitt claims that the numbers back up his research, but he rarely provides the data itself, which makes it difficult to tell how much he might be manipulating statistics to serve his own ends. It makes the book seem like it’s been dumbed down for the plebian masses, which will be very frustrating to any intelligent reader who wants to look at Levitt’s data themselves. Any reader who doesn’t feel like reading the numbers can do what most of us did in undergrad—skip the numbers sections. It’s just sloppy; I can’t imagine Levitt would do this in a formal economics paper.The book also lacks much in the way of an unifying theme, a problem that is acknowledged within the text itself; that isn’t only sad, it’s sloppy. I doubt that a writer of Dubner’s skill and an economist of Levitt’s apparent genius (more on that below) are totally incapable of thinking of and describing some kind of unifying theme throughout this work. It just smacks of laziness, even more so when there’s a half-hearted “well, I guess you could say it’s this…” sort of thing in the epilogue. Again, I have trouble imagining that Levitt would submit a paper that was this disjointed to a serious economic publication; why should the general public be treated less seriously?The Ugly:The self-aggrandizement. Oh, the self-aggrandizement.Every chapter is preceded by excerpts from an article about Levitt, which all tell us what a brilliant and unconventional economist this man is. In the introduction, we’re told that he really wasn’t that interested in writing a book, unless he got to work with this wonderful journalist who had written an article about him earlier. The cover promises that we will be “dazzled” by a “rogue economist” who explains “the hidden side of everything.”For all of this talk of brilliance and dazzling explanations, the book doesn’t seem that brilliant. It seems like a transcript of some interesting dinner conversation with a smart guy, the sort that makes you go home and think, “hey, this stuff is interesting, I ought to go pick up a book about it.” Of course, the problem here is that you’ve already picked up the book.The fact that Levitt wasn’t that interested in writing a book in the first place is telling; this book feels like something written by a person who needed to get the work done, but really wasn’t engaged in what he was doing. Maybe he should have waited until he was a little more motivated."

This is an awful book, yes I read the whole thing, like bitter medicine to a toddler, and had to see what the fuss was about.This Amazon review nails it.  Here's my review/rant. I'm reading this is 2012, maybe the hype in 2005 was different and people ate this kind of stuff up, even then I don't think we were that gullible at this time. There were good social science/stats books out there. This book pales in comparison to the works of Malcolm Gladwell and others. Levitt is making something out of nothing from strange stories he heard, now he's stitching them together suggesting there's a *GASP* hidden side to everything. Because the KKK spoke in code, real estate listings are supposedly in code, and we're all being duped into spending more for our house because of the secret speak between realtors! How about consumers don't just read a real estate listings but check a place out before making the biggest purchase of their lives, one could argue there's secret speak in every industry. For his final chapter (which is in the middle of the book) Levitt's grand finale, Black people name their children differently to White people! The second half of the book is blog posts from their blog more atrocious reading from these ranting lunatics. There's no appeal to science, Levitt is throwing a lot of his own opinion, and making wild estimations and bringing up even wilder conclusions. It's pretty obvious Levitt is a shrewd businessman, he's not just writing books, but has a well to do following with his blog, radio station and yes even movie! This is ""easy to consume"" garbage for the masses. "

I almost finished but couldn't do it in the end. Some of the things the author talks about seem like they could be truths but the majority of it is not. Don't waste your time. Update: I don't recall the specifics as this was over a year ago that I ""attempted"" to read the book. I don't remember how far I got through it before I stopped reading. I can recall that many of the data and ideas presented about crime statistics and correlations were not accurate. The book put claims on cause and effect in regards to violent crime. I knew that the correlations were no more then the Authors conclusion based on one view of statistical data use. The use of statistics is often (many times not on purpose) biased. I have studied and been in law enforcement since 1990 and have worked serious felony level crimes since 1999. I know from experience and studies that some of the ideas he presented as ""fact"" were not fact but more of an opinion that can be easily concluded when someone does not look at the entire data of violent crimes."

Even worse is the impression given that the background research is astonishingly thorough and accurate. It is not. Don't take their word for it on anything. A quick Google search yields rebuttals from true experts in the various fields that effectively point out flaws in their quotes, facts, and logic. I love that they promote the ideas of critical thinking. I love that they promote the idea of thorough research and questioning the status quo. I love that they promote use of numbers and statistics to explore ideas in an attempt to find the truth. But I wish that they were providing as good of a demonstration of the principles as they claim to be.Their conclusions are then presented as irrefutable, as if they are a magic bullet of the truth, rather than a heartfelt (presumably) effort at finding truth, subject to revision based on refined thought or background research. And then there is the assignment of cause to correlation...... In at least some cases, I am not convinced that it is truth that they are after so much as their own agenda (on oh so many levels).

30,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934648-jim,1,"This was an interesting book. I say it was interesting because I started liking it (a lot) when I first read it, as time passed I liked it less and less. In that way I call it a candy book, tastes good at first but leaves you worse off for reading it. In my opinion, there are two problems with the book: First, Stephen Dubner comes across as a sycophant. Way to much of the book is spent praising Levitt. Secondly, I was disappointed in the lack of detail provided about Livitt's hypothesis. I wanted more. It was like reading War and Peace and discovering that you read the abridged version and in fact the book wasn't 100 pages long. This disappointment may have come from my engineering background and my strong desire to really understand economics. This book didn't offer any of that, only a titillating glimpse of the economics. In some regards one may think my single start rating is to harsh. As mind candy this book was quite good. I did enjoy reading it at the time. Whats more, it did encourage me to study real economics. I am currently enrolled in a masters program in economics and this book did play a very small roll in that decision process. However, as I learn more about economics I realize how shallow the book in fact was. While this is not the forum for a comprehensive review of the topics presented in the book, or an analysis of how good the economics in Freekanomics are, a review in ""Journal of Economic Literature (Vol XLV, Dec. 2007 pp 973)"" quotes Livitt as saying: ""There is no question I have written some ridiculous papers."" The article then goes on to quote a paper by Noam Scheibler(2007) describing Livitt's comparing some of his papers to the fashion industry. ""Sometimes you write papers and they're less about the actual result, more about your vision of how you think the profession should be. And so I think some of my most ridiculous papers actually fall in the high-fashion category."""
31,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/154731-rachel,2,"Sure, this book was a compelling read that offered us all some great amo for cocktail party conversation. But ultimately I think most of what Leavitt claims is crap. He dodges accoutability with the disclaimer about his book NOT being a scholarly work, but then goes on to drop statistics, theories and expert opinions. These assertions laid, he doesn't provide readers with enough information to critically examine his perspectives.Ultimately I have a problem with the unquestioned, unaccoutable role of the public intellectual. Leavitt dances around with his PhD on his sleeve, but is never subject to peer review or any sort of academic criticism. I think it's irresponsible. "
32,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"I loved this book, though I think the title is a bit misleading. It's not really about economics. In fact, he's showing you what interesting things you can discover when you apply statistical analysis to problems where you wouldn't normally think of using it. I use statistical methods a fair amount in my own work, so I found it particularly interesting. The most startling and thought-provoking example is definitely the unexpected reduction in US urban crime that occurred towards the end of the 20th century. Crime rates had been rising for decades, and people were really worried about what would happen if the trend continued. Then, suddenly, they peaked and started to decline. Why? There were a bunch of theories, all of them superficially plausible.Levitt crunched the numbers, to see what proportion of the variance could be ascribed to the different factors. This is a completely standard technique; it just hadn't been used here before. He came to the conclusion that the single most important factor, by far, was the ready availability of abortion that started to come in after Roe v Wade. Other things, like more resources for policing and tougher sentencing policies, probably helped, but not nearly as much. I didn't at all get the impression that he had been expecting this result from the start, and just wanted to prove his point. He processed the data, and went where the numbers led him. That's how you're supposed to do science.The clincher, at least as far as I was concerned, was the fact that crime statistics peaked at different points in different states, the peaks correlating very well with the dates when each state started making abortion available. States that brought it in early had correspondingly early peaks in their crime rates. It's hard to see how that could happen if Levitt's explanation weren't correct.I am surprised that there hasn't been more discussion of Levitt's findings in the political world. Maybe it's just regarded as too hot to handle. But if Levitt is right, and at the moment I would say it's up to his critics to explain why he isn't, then pro-life campaigners would seem be heading in a very unfortunate direction."

34,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33765-justin,4,"I guess some people don't like this book because it's not centered around one theme. Instead, it's more about the seemingly diffuse academic work of one of the authors Steven D. Levitt (the other author is a journalist, Stephen J. Dubner). Levitt is something of an economist but more like a social scientist using the tools of Microeconomics applied to other fields that happen to catch his interest (often having something to do with cheating, corruption, crime, etc.). In the back of the book he mentions how he considers himself a student of Thomas Schelling who is kind of like the father of Game Theory (strategy theory?), except much more of a 'man of ideas' than what one might think of when one thinks about game theory today, which is much more mathematical. Anyway, as for the book itself, I thought it was really great. I really like what Levitt is doing as far as using the tools of Microeconomics in other fields. One of my intellectual heroes (I only have a few) is Kenneth Waltz who did the exact same thing in the field of International Relations in the '70's and wrote the seminal book The Theory of International Politics, which pretty much the single-handedly invented defensive (neo) realism. More generally, I think Economics is probably the most formalized of the social sciences and the one to which others should esteem. A lot of the Political Science field concerned with both voter behavior and how legislatures work is now pretty formalized as well, and, I, for one, think this is a good thing. I don't see how anyone could think it's not (good) unless they a)think the scientific method cannot be used to analyze human behavior; or b)have a visceral aversion to mathematical languages. Actually, I am one of the latter, but I, at least, see the value in having a formalized language to work with.As for the book itself, there's some maybe-controversial things in there like Levitt did some work that showed that the legalization of abortion in the U.S. (Roe v. Wade) was one of the main reasons that crime in the U.S. dropped in the '90's and continues at the same rates today. He stands behind it pretty hardily though and it doesn't seem like he has a moral agenda at all. Some might argue that the best writers are those who are best able to disguise their moral agenda, but considering he writes about all kinds of not-very-serious things like how sumo wrestling in Japan is probably corrupt as far as matches g,o and there's stuff in there about how real estate agents sell their houses for more than they sell their customers' houses (which, may or may not be surprising), I really don't think he has a hidden pro-life agenda. Anyway, there's a bunch of stuff in there (the book), hence the 'freak' in Freakonomics. It's well-written. It's not dry. It's written for a lay audience. I recommend it. Read it and feel the power of social science! ;-)"

I did, however, learn from this book. It still amazes me that the way to reduce crime seems to be the legalization of abortion. I did not expect that, but it does make quite a lot of sense and I’m all for women having control over their own bodies and futures, of course. Sidenote: I despised the author’s arbitrary uses of female and male pronouns. Like, a teacher is a SHE and then an architect a HE? That certainly didn’t gain my respect."

The story sounds at least partially made up. It then jumped into predictable white guilt inducing trash and goes into mental contortions using ""data"" and sociological explanations for black criminality and low IQ scores. The writers of this book are also obsessively pro-Abortion. The only surprise was they used statistics to show you are much more likely to die from an automobile or a swimming pool than a gun. This book would probably appeal to upper middle class liberals who like to consider themselves clever and politically astute from their isolated armchairs.

This is a book about the world and not about any science in particular. It's about learning to question the given and see beyond the obvious. An extremely useful gift in the misguiding modern world.Yeah, populistic much too much but neverthless compulsively readable. A definite revisit and reread.Q:As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions. His particular gift is the ability to ask such questions. For instance: If drug dealers make so much money, why do they still live with their mothers? Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What really caused crime rates to plunge during the past decade? Do real-estate agents have their clients’ best interests at heart? Why do black parents give their children names that may hurt their career prospects? Do schoolteachers cheat to meet high-stakes testing standards? Is sumo wrestling corrupt?And how does a homeless man in tattered clothing afford $50 headphones?(c)Q:the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and—if the right questions are asked—is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking.(c)Q:“Experts”—from criminologists to real-estate agents-use their informational advantage to serve their own agenda. However, they can be beat at their own game. And in the face of the Internet, their informational advantage is shrinking every day-as evidenced by, among other things, the falling price of coffins and life-insurance premiums.Knowing what to measure and how to measure it makes a complicated world much less so. If you learn how to look at data in the right way, you can explain riddles that otherwise might have seemed impossible. Because there is nothing like the sheer power of numbers to scrub away layers of confusion and contradiction.So the aim of this book is to explore the hidden side of . . . everything. This may occasionally be a frustrating exercise. It may sometimes feel as if we are peering at the world through a straw or even staring into a funhouse mirror; but the idea is to look at many different scenarios and examine them in a way they have rarely been examined....Steven Levitt may not fully believe in himself, but he does believe in this: teachers and criminals and real-estate agents may lie, and politicians, and even CIA analysts. But numbers don’t.(c)Q:Levitt had an interview for the Society of Fellows, the venerable intellectual clubhouse atHarvard that pays young scholars to do their own work, for three years, with no commitments.Levitt felt he didn’t stand a chance. For starters, he didn’t consider himself an intellectual. He wouldbe interviewed over dinner by the senior fellows, a collection of world-renowned philosophers,scientists, and historians. He worried he wouldn’t have enough conversation to last even the firstcourse.Disquietingly, one of the senior fellows said to Levitt, “I’m having a hard time seeing theunifying theme of your work. Could you explain it?”Levitt was stymied. He had no idea what his unifying theme was, or if he even had one.Amartya Sen, the future Nobel-winning economist, jumped in and neatly summarized what hesaw as Levitt’s theme.Yes, Levitt said eagerly, that’s my theme.Another fellow then offered another theme.You’re right, said Levitt, my theme.And so it went, like dogs tugging at a bone, until the philosopher Robert Nozick interrupted.“How old are you, Steve?” he asked.“Twenty-six.”Nozick turned to the other fellows: “He’s twenty-six years old. Why does he need to have aunifying theme? Maybe he’s going to be one of those people who’s so talented he doesn’t need one.He’ll take a question and he’ll just answer it, and it’ll be fine.”(c)Q:There are three basic flavors of incentive: economic, social, and moral. Very often a single incentive scheme will include all three varieties. Think about the anti-smoking campaign of recent years. The addition of a $3-per-pack “sin tax” is a strong economic incentive against buying cigarettes. The banning of cigarettes in restaurants and bars is a powerful social incentive. And when the U.S. government asserts that terrorists raise money by selling black-market cigarettes, that acts as a rather jarring moral incentive.Some of the most compelling incentives yet invented have been put in place to deter crime. Considering this fact, it might be worthwhile to take a familiar question—why is there so much crime in modern society?—and stand it on its head: why isn’t there a lot more crime? After all, every one of us regularly passes up opportunities to maim, steal, and defraud. The chance of going to jail—thereby losing your job, your house, and your freedom, all of which are essentially economic penalties—is certainly a strong incentive. But when it comes to crime, people also respond to moral incentives (they don’t want to do something they consider wrong) and social incentives (they don’t want to be seen by others as doing something wrong). For certain types of misbehavior, social incentives are terribly powerful. In an echo of Hester Prynne’s scarlet letter, many American cities now fight prostitution with a “shaming” offensive, posting pictures of convicted johns (and prostitutes) on websites or on local-access television. Which is a more horrifying deterrent: a $500 fine for soliciting a prostitute or the thought of your friends and family ogling you on www.HookersAndJohns.com.(с)Q:Some cheating leaves barely a shadow of evidence. In other cases, the evidence is massive.Consider what happened one spring evening at midnight in 1987: seven million American childrensuddenly disappeared. The worst kidnapping wave in history? Hardly. It was the night of April 15,and the Internal Revenue Service had just changed a rule. Instead of merely listing each dependentchild, tax filers were now required to provide a Social Security number for each child. Suddenly,seven million children—children who had existed only as phantom exemptions on the previousyear’s 1040 forms—vanished, representing about one in ten of all dependent children in the UnitedStates(c)Q:Of all the ideas that Kennedy had thought up—and would think up in the future—to fight bigotry, his Superman campaign was easily the cleverest and probably the most productive. It had the precise effect he hoped: turning the Klan’s secrecy against itself, converting precious knowledgeinto ammunition for mockery. Instead of roping in millions of members as it had just a generationearlier, the Klan lost momentum and began to founder. Although the Klan would never quite die,especially down South—David Duke, a smooth-talking Klan leader from Louisiana, mountedlegitimate bids for the U.S. Senate and other offices—it was also never quite the same. In The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America, the historian Wyn Craig Wade calls Stetson Kennedy “the single most important factor in preventing a postwar revival of the Ku Klux Klan in the North.”This did not happen because Kennedy was courageous or resolute or unflappable, even though he was all of these. It happened because Kennedy understood the raw power of information. The Ku Klux Klan was a group whose power—much like that of politicians or real-estate agents or stockbrokers—was derived in large part from the fact that it hoarded information. Once that information falls into the wrong hands (or, depending on your point of view, the right hands), much of the group’s advantage disappears.(с)Q:Information is so powerful that the assumption of information, even if the information does not actually exist, can have a sobering effect.(c)Q:It is common for one party to a transaction to have better information than another party. Inthe parlance of economists, such a case is known as an information asymmetry. We accept as averity of capitalism that someone (usually an expert) knows more than someone else (usually aconsumer). (c)Q:If you were to assume that many experts use their information to your detriment, you’d beright. Experts depend on the fact that you don’t have the information they do. Or that you are sobefuddled by the complexity of their operation that you wouldn’t know what to do with theinformation if you had it. Or that you are so in awe of their expertise that you wouldn’t darechallenge them. If your doctor suggests that you have angioplasty—even though some currentresearch suggests that angioplasty often does little to prevent heart attacks—you aren’t likely tothink that the doctor is using his informational advantage to make a few thousand dollars forhimself or his buddy. But as David Hillis, an interventional cardiologist at the University of TexasSouthwestern Medical Center in Dallas, explained to the New York Times, a doctor may have thesame economic incentives as a car salesman or a funeral director or a mutual fund manager: “Ifyou’re an invasive cardiologist and Joe Smith, the local internist, is sending you patients, and if youtell them they don’t need the procedure, pretty soon Joe Smith doesn’t send patients anymore.”(c)Q:Consider this true story, related by John Donohue, a law professor who in 2001 was teaching at Stanford University: “I was just about to buy a house on the Stanford campus,” he recalls, “and the seller’s agent kept telling me what a good deal I was getting because the market was about to zoom. As soon as I signed the purchase contract, he asked me if I would need an agent to sell my previous Stanford house. I told him that I would probably try to sell without an agent, and he replied, ‘John, that might work under normal conditions, but with the market tanking now, you really need the help of a broker.’”Within five minutes, a zooming market had tanked. Such are the marvels that can be conjured by an agent in search of the next deal.(c)Q:They were also a lot richer, taller, skinnier, and better-looking than average. That, at least, is what they wrote about themselves. More than 4 percent of the online daters claimed to earn more than $200,000 a year, whereas fewer than 1 percent of typical Internet users actually earn that much, suggesting that three of the four big earners were exaggerating. Male and female users typically reported that they are about an inch taller than the national average. As for weight, the men were in line with the national average, but the women typically said they weighed about twenty pounds less than the national average.Most impressively, fully 70 percent of the women claimed “above average” looks, including 24 percent claiming “very good looks.” The online men too were gorgeous: 67 percent called themselves “above average,” including 21 percent with “very good looks.” This leaves only about 30 percent of the users with “average” looks, including a paltry 1 percent with “less than average” looks—which suggests that the typical online dater is either a fabulist, a narcissist, or simply resistant to the meaning of “average.” (Or perhaps they are all just realists: as any real-estate agent knows, the typical house isn’t “charming” or “fantastic,” but unless you say it is, no one will even bother to take a look.) Twenty-eight percent of the women on the site said they were blond, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dyeing, or lying, or both. Some users, meanwhile, were bracingly honest. Eight percent of the men—about 1 in every 12 conceded that they were married, with half of these 8 percent reporting that they were “happily married.” But the fact that they were honest doesn’t mean they were rash. Of the 258 “happily married” men in the sample, only 9 chose to post a picture of themselves. The reward of gaining a mistress was evidently outweighed by the risk of having your wife discover your personal ad. (c)Q:But if there is no unifying theme to Freakonomics, there is at least a common thread running through the everyday application of Freakonomics. It has to do with thinking sensibly about how people behave in the real world. All it requires is a novel way of looking, of discerning, of measuring. This isn’t necessarily a difficult task, nor does it require supersophisticated thinking. We have essentially tried to figure out what the typical gang member or sumo wrestler figured out on his own (although we had to do so in reverse).Will the ability to think such thoughts improve your life materially? Probably not. Perhaps you’ll put up a sturdy gate around your swimming pool or push your real-estate agent to work a little harder. But the net effect is likely to be more subtle than that. You might become more skeptical of the conventional wisdom; you may begin looking for hints as to how things aren’t quite what they seem; perhaps you will seek out some trove of data and sift through it, balancing your intelligence and your intuition to arrive at a glimmering new idea. Some of these ideas might make you uncomfortable, even unpopular. To claim that legalized abortion resulted in a massive drop in crime will inevitably lead to explosive moral reactions. (c)"

Pretty interesting how much he dislikes criminologists but then (if I remember correctly), only mentions the same one or two names over and over when giving examples of criminologists that had agendas/tricked the public. Also the fact that the entire book, and the issues, feels very simplified. Actually the author puts it best himself: ""The typical parenting expert, like experts in other fields, is prone to sound exceedingly sure of himself. An expert doesn’t so much argue the various sides of an issue, as plant his flag firmly on one side. That’s because an expert who’s argument reeks of restraint or nuance often doesn’t get much attention. An expert must be bold if he hopes to alchemise (?) his homespun theory into conventional wisdom."" This is often how I perceived the book to be written, very simplified, without enough nuance or room for possible explanations - only one right answer. I didn't like how the book was written, how the topics where dealt with, and had a hard time taking anything seriously after all of the self-admiration and the repeated ""all experts have agendas (except for us)"" talk in every chapter.

Even for someone like me whose general response to economics is *snore*. And it's mainly because Freakonomics is not really about economics, but involves applying statistical analysis to many social issues and questions. Very easy to read. Lots of shocking discoveries that seem weighted in fact - Roe v. Wade is responsible for a huge drop in crime? No wonder some people are pissed off with this book. It's really quite fascinating to look at the power of incentives - economic, social and moral - and examine cause and effect. One of my favourite personal experiences with silly notions of cause and effect is diet soft drinks. I confess to being a bit of a coke zero addict. It's not great for you (the sodium makes you more thirsty, a lot of potassium can lead to palpitations, and a lot of phosphoric acid has been linked to kidney problems) but I've lost count of how many times people have cited statistics showing that diet soda drinkers are more likely to be overweight and diabetic. Of course they are! If you're overweight and diabetic you're more likely to drink the low-calorie, sugar-free alternatives, aren't you? So strange how people assume it is A that causes B and ignore the possibility of it being the opposite.Anyway, my issue with this entertaining book is that I think it may be - to be frank - bullshit. Not all of it, sure. But definitely some of it. The writers state their points very confidently (some might say with a touch too much smarm) but it requires you to take a lot of what they say on faith. And some of the jumps they make between statistics and conclusion don't quite add up for me. I know many others have felt the same.But here was the thing that really got me, the thing that made me smell bullshit: I'm fairly confident something they said is not rooted in any truth. And let's be clear: I am a total noob when it comes to most statistics and economics, so if even I can spot something a bit off, it really makes me question the rest of it. Here it is:
Women's rights advocates, for instance, have hyped the incidence of sexual assault, claiming that one in three American women will in her lifetime be a victim of rape or attempted rape. (The actual figure is more like one in eight - but the advocates know it would take a callous person to publicly dispute their claims.)
This, if true, implies two things. 1) Those advocating women's rights are using false data, therefore undermining their credibility, and 2) They have invented a statistic to intentionally support their cause, knowing no one will dispute it (absolutely bizarre that the author thinks no one is disputing women's rights claims, but okay...)Well, being a feminist and someone who has spent an awful lot of time reading and writing about women's rights organizations and statistics, my eyes narrowed a little. See, in all my research, I've never seen or heard any claim that ""1 in 3 women will be a victim of rape or attempted rape"". I have heard the ""1 in 3"" statistic, but a somewhat different one.So, obviously, I went to look it up. I spent a couple of hours going through Google and every women's rights organization page I could find, trying to uncover a single case where that statistic was used. I found exactly: none. The only other thing I found that mentioned it was a Time article attempting to debunk so-called ""feminist myths"": http://time.com/3222543/5-feminist-my...The statistic the authors appear to have misquoted is that ""1 in 3 women will experience sexual violence, or physical violence by an intimate partner"", which is used often. Sexual violence here is an ambiguous term, leaving room for wider interpretations and probably explaining why, with the addition of domestic violence into the statistic, the number is at ""1 in 3"" instead of ""1 in 8"". Furthermore, not only have the authors misrepresented the statistical claim itself, but they have also suggested that women's rights advocates have pulled the numbers from thin air to make a point - on the contrary, this is a study conducted by the World Health Organization on the ""Global and regional estimates of violence against women"".I like the idea of the book, but this really put me off. Perhaps it was a one-off error that I managed to spot. Perhaps. Either way, I started to be less impressed by the facts and statistics they presented. Still, very enjoyable book for the most part."

Levitt and Dubner explore a diverse range of subjects: from linking Roe v. Wade to violent crime, cheating by teachers and sumo wrestlers to an economic model of drug dealing. I’d like to think that the stories told by the authors and the way they analyze conventional thinking would put me on a path to look past easy answers. Having completed Freakonomics, do I look at the world radically differently than I did before picking up the book? It is Interesting to look at subjects from a different angle. Positing that economics and specifically the field of study now dubbed freakonomics has nothing to do with morality is an intriguing concept as well, but deciding which stories to tell is necessarily selective. Indeed, the focus is interesting. So yes I enjoyed Freakonomics, but feel I should have more to say about it and the authors’ underlying premises than I do. 3.25 stars "

51,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/972904-jake,2,"The Basics:Freakonomics isn’t really about any one thing, which makes it a bit hard to summarize. In essence, it’s economist Steven Levitt playing around with economic principles and basic statistical analysis to examine various cultural trends and phenomena. He tackles a variety of questions, from whether or not sumo wrestlers cheat (they do) to whether or not a child’s name determines his success (it doesn’t). He does this all through examining statistics and data, trying to find facts to back up various assertions rather than relying on conventional wisdom.The Good:As a person who is sick of the inability of most people to have a rational discourse on any even vaguely politicized topic, and a self-proclaimed skeptic, it’s nice to read anyone who endorses looking at hard data to make judgments about possibly controversial issues. Levitt does a nice job of not only proclaiming the advantages of this sort of rational outlook, but also of showing that when you actually examine the data, you sometimes get surprising results. Furthermore, he takes the time to point out that there is a difference between correlation and causation, and that many people mistake one for the other. Again, a nice touch.The actual questions that Levitt asks are all fairly interesting, though some will appeal to certain readers more than others. In addition to cheating sumotori and strange names, Levitt also examines cheating teachers, the economics of crack dealers, and the effect of abortion on crime. Crime, in point of fact, seems to be Levitt’s greatest interest, and I wonder if he might not have been better served by writing an entire book on the relationship between economics and crime, as opposed to trying to touch on a number of different subjects that are all largely unrelated. It might have made for a tighter, more focused book.The writing is solid; simple and easy, but solid. Despite being a book about economics, it’s not a terribly dense read, as witnessed by the fact that I finished it off in about two days. Granted, it was two days of heavy reading, but it was still two days.The Bad:For a book that’s so gung ho about statistics, there aren’t many statistics in here. Levitt claims that the numbers back up his research, but he rarely provides the data itself, which makes it difficult to tell how much he might be manipulating statistics to serve his own ends. It makes the book seem like it’s been dumbed down for the plebian masses, which will be very frustrating to any intelligent reader who wants to look at Levitt’s data themselves. Any reader who doesn’t feel like reading the numbers can do what most of us did in undergrad—skip the numbers sections. It’s just sloppy; I can’t imagine Levitt would do this in a formal economics paper.The book also lacks much in the way of an unifying theme, a problem that is acknowledged within the text itself; that isn’t only sad, it’s sloppy. I doubt that a writer of Dubner’s skill and an economist of Levitt’s apparent genius (more on that below) are totally incapable of thinking of and describing some kind of unifying theme throughout this work. It just smacks of laziness, even more so when there’s a half-hearted “well, I guess you could say it’s this…” sort of thing in the epilogue. Again, I have trouble imagining that Levitt would submit a paper that was this disjointed to a serious economic publication; why should the general public be treated less seriously?The Ugly:The self-aggrandizement. Oh, the self-aggrandizement.Every chapter is preceded by excerpts from an article about Levitt, which all tell us what a brilliant and unconventional economist this man is. In the introduction, we’re told that he really wasn’t that interested in writing a book, unless he got to work with this wonderful journalist who had written an article about him earlier. The cover promises that we will be “dazzled” by a “rogue economist” who explains “the hidden side of everything.”For all of this talk of brilliance and dazzling explanations, the book doesn’t seem that brilliant. It seems like a transcript of some interesting dinner conversation with a smart guy, the sort that makes you go home and think, “hey, this stuff is interesting, I ought to go pick up a book about it.” Of course, the problem here is that you’ve already picked up the book.The fact that Levitt wasn’t that interested in writing a book in the first place is telling; this book feels like something written by a person who needed to get the work done, but really wasn’t engaged in what he was doing. Maybe he should have waited until he was a little more motivated."

I'm reading this is 2012, maybe the hype in 2005 was different and people ate this kind of stuff up, even then I don't think we were that gullible at this time. There were good social science/stats books out there. This book pales in comparison to the works of Malcolm Gladwell and others. Levitt is making something out of nothing from strange stories he heard, now he's stitching them together suggesting there's a *GASP* hidden side to everything. Because the KKK spoke in code, real estate listings are supposedly in code, and we're all being duped into spending more for our house because of the secret speak between realtors! How about consumers don't just read a real estate listings but check a place out before making the biggest purchase of their lives, one could argue there's secret speak in every industry. For his final chapter (which is in the middle of the book) Levitt's grand finale, Black people name their children differently to White people! The second half of the book is blog posts from their blog more atrocious reading from these ranting lunatics. There's no appeal to science, Levitt is throwing a lot of his own opinion, and making wild estimations and bringing up even wilder conclusions. It's pretty obvious Levitt is a shrewd businessman, he's not just writing books, but has a well to do following with his blog, radio station and yes even movie!

I knew that the correlations were no more then the Authors conclusion based on one view of statistical data use. The use of statistics is often (many times not on purpose) biased. I have studied and been in law enforcement since 1990 and have worked serious felony level crimes since 1999.

I say it was interesting because I started liking it (a lot) when I first read it, as time passed I liked it less and less. In that way I call it a candy book, tastes good at first but leaves you worse off for reading it. In my opinion, there are two problems with the book: First, Stephen Dubner comes across as a sycophant. Way to much of the book is spent praising Levitt. Secondly, I was disappointed in the lack of detail provided about Livitt's hypothesis. I wanted more. It was like reading War and Peace and discovering that you read the abridged version and in fact the book wasn't 100 pages long. This disappointment may have come from my engineering background and my strong desire to really understand economics. This book didn't offer any of that, only a titillating glimpse of the economics. In some regards one may think my single start rating is to harsh. As mind candy this book was quite good. I did enjoy reading it at the time. Whats more, it did encourage me to study real economics. I am currently enrolled in a masters program in economics and this book did play a very small roll in that decision process. However, as I learn more about economics I realize how shallow the book in fact was. While this is not the forum for a comprehensive review of the topics presented in the book, or an analysis of how good the economics in Freekanomics are, a review in ""Journal of Economic Literature (Vol XLV, Dec. 2007 pp 973)"" quotes Livitt as saying: ""There is no question I have written some ridiculous papers."" The article then goes on to quote a paper by Noam Scheibler(2007) describing Livitt's comparing some of his papers to the fashion industry. ""Sometimes you write papers and they're less about the actual result, more about your vision of how you think the profession should be. And so I think some of my most ridiculous papers actually fall in the high-fashion category."""

These assertions laid, he doesn't provide readers with enough information to critically examine his perspectives.Ultimately I have a problem with the unquestioned, unaccoutable role of the public intellectual. Leavitt dances around with his PhD on his sleeve, but is never subject to peer review or any sort of academic criticism. I think it's irresponsible. "

In fact, he's showing you what interesting things you can discover when you apply statistical analysis to problems where you wouldn't normally think of using it. I use statistical methods a fair amount in my own work, so I found it particularly interesting. The most startling and thought-provoking example is definitely the unexpected reduction in US urban crime that occurred towards the end of the 20th century. Crime rates had been rising for decades, and people were really worried about what would happen if the trend continued. Then, suddenly, they peaked and started to decline. Why? There were a bunch of theories, all of them superficially plausible.Levitt crunched the numbers, to see what proportion of the variance could be ascribed to the different factors. This is a completely standard technique; it just hadn't been used here before. He came to the conclusion that the single most important factor, by far, was the ready availability of abortion that started to come in after Roe v Wade. Other things, like more resources for policing and tougher sentencing policies, probably helped, but not nearly as much. I didn't at all get the impression that he had been expecting this result from the start, and just wanted to prove his point. He processed the data, and went where the numbers led him. That's how you're supposed to do science.The clincher, at least as far as I was concerned, was the fact that crime statistics peaked at different points in different states, the peaks correlating very well with the dates when each state started making abortion available. States that brought it in early had correspondingly early peaks in their crime rates. It's hard to see how that could happen if Levitt's explanation weren't correct.I am surprised that there hasn't been more discussion of Levitt's findings in the political world. Maybe it's just regarded as too hot to handle. But if Levitt is right, and at the moment I would say it's up to his critics to explain why he isn't, then pro-life campaigners would seem be heading in a very unfortunate direction."

64,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33765-justin,4,"I guess some people don't like this book because it's not centered around one theme. Instead, it's more about the seemingly diffuse academic work of one of the authors Steven D. Levitt (the other author is a journalist, Stephen J. Dubner). Levitt is something of an economist but more like a social scientist using the tools of Microeconomics applied to other fields that happen to catch his interest (often having something to do with cheating, corruption, crime, etc.). In the back of the book he mentions how he considers himself a student of Thomas Schelling who is kind of like the father of Game Theory (strategy theory?), except much more of a 'man of ideas' than what one might think of when one thinks about game theory today, which is much more mathematical. Anyway, as for the book itself, I thought it was really great. I really like what Levitt is doing as far as using the tools of Microeconomics in other fields. One of my intellectual heroes (I only have a few) is Kenneth Waltz who did the exact same thing in the field of International Relations in the '70's and wrote the seminal book The Theory of International Politics, which pretty much the single-handedly invented defensive (neo) realism. More generally, I think Economics is probably the most formalized of the social sciences and the one to which others should esteem. A lot of the Political Science field concerned with both voter behavior and how legislatures work is now pretty formalized as well, and, I, for one, think this is a good thing. I don't see how anyone could think it's not (good) unless they a)think the scientific method cannot be used to analyze human behavior; or b)have a visceral aversion to mathematical languages. Actually, I am one of the latter, but I, at least, see the value in having a formalized language to work with.As for the book itself, there's some maybe-controversial things in there like Levitt did some work that showed that the legalization of abortion in the U.S. (Roe v. Wade) was one of the main reasons that crime in the U.S. dropped in the '90's and continues at the same rates today. He stands behind it pretty hardily though and it doesn't seem like he has a moral agenda at all. Some might argue that the best writers are those who are best able to disguise their moral agenda, but considering he writes about all kinds of not-very-serious things like how sumo wrestling in Japan is probably corrupt as far as matches g,o and there's stuff in there about how real estate agents sell their houses for more than they sell their customers' houses (which, may or may not be surprising), I really don't think he has a hidden pro-life agenda. Anyway, there's a bunch of stuff in there (the book), hence the 'freak' in Freakonomics. It's well-written. It's not dry. It's written for a lay audience. I recommend it. Read it and feel the power of social science! ;-)"

I did, however, learn from this book. It still amazes me that the way to reduce crime seems to be the legalization of abortion. I did not expect that, but it does make quite a lot of sense and I’m all for women having control over their own bodies and futures, of course. Sidenote: I despised the author’s arbitrary uses of female and male pronouns. Like, a teacher is a SHE and then an architect a HE? That certainly didn’t gain my respect."

I quickly realized what I was in for when early in the book when the authors gave their background as Harvard Jews and profiled a guy that infiltrated the KKK for the ADL. The story sounds at least partially made up. It then jumped into predictable white guilt inducing trash and goes into mental contortions using ""data"" and sociological explanations for black criminality and low IQ scores. The writers of this book are also obsessively pro-Abortion. The only surprise was they used statistics to show you are much more likely to die from an automobile or a swimming pool than a gun. This book would probably appeal to upper middle class liberals who like to consider themselves clever and politically astute from their isolated armchairs. For me Freakonomics was a big load of garbage."

This is a book about the world and not about any science in particular. It's about learning to question the given and see beyond the obvious. An extremely useful gift in the misguiding modern world.Yeah, populistic much too much but neverthless compulsively readable. A definite revisit and reread.Q:As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions. His particular gift is the ability to ask such questions. For instance: If drug dealers make so much money, why do they still live with their mothers? Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What really caused crime rates to plunge during the past decade? Do real-estate agents have their clients’ best interests at heart? Why do black parents give their children names that may hurt their career prospects? Do schoolteachers cheat to meet high-stakes testing standards? Is sumo wrestling corrupt?And how does a homeless man in tattered clothing afford $50 headphones?(c)Q:the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and—if the right questions are asked—is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking.(c)Q:“Experts”—from criminologists to real-estate agents-use their informational advantage to serve their own agenda. However, they can be beat at their own game. And in the face of the Internet, their informational advantage is shrinking every day-as evidenced by, among other things, the falling price of coffins and life-insurance premiums.Knowing what to measure and how to measure it makes a complicated world much less so. If you learn how to look at data in the right way, you can explain riddles that otherwise might have seemed impossible. Because there is nothing like the sheer power of numbers to scrub away layers of confusion and contradiction.So the aim of this book is to explore the hidden side of . . . everything. This may occasionally be a frustrating exercise. It may sometimes feel as if we are peering at the world through a straw or even staring into a funhouse mirror; but the idea is to look at many different scenarios and examine them in a way they have rarely been examined....Steven Levitt may not fully believe in himself, but he does believe in this: teachers and criminals and real-estate agents may lie, and politicians, and even CIA analysts. But numbers don’t.(c)Q:Levitt had an interview for the Society of Fellows, the venerable intellectual clubhouse atHarvard that pays young scholars to do their own work, for three years, with no commitments.Levitt felt he didn’t stand a chance. For starters, he didn’t consider himself an intellectual. He wouldbe interviewed over dinner by the senior fellows, a collection of world-renowned philosophers,scientists, and historians. He worried he wouldn’t have enough conversation to last even the firstcourse.Disquietingly, one of the senior fellows said to Levitt, “I’m having a hard time seeing theunifying theme of your work. Could you explain it?”Levitt was stymied. He had no idea what his unifying theme was, or if he even had one.Amartya Sen, the future Nobel-winning economist, jumped in and neatly summarized what hesaw as Levitt’s theme.Yes, Levitt said eagerly, that’s my theme.Another fellow then offered another theme.You’re right, said Levitt, my theme.And so it went, like dogs tugging at a bone, until the philosopher Robert Nozick interrupted.“How old are you, Steve?” he asked.“Twenty-six.”Nozick turned to the other fellows: “He’s twenty-six years old. Why does he need to have aunifying theme? Maybe he’s going to be one of those people who’s so talented he doesn’t need one.He’ll take a question and he’ll just answer it, and it’ll be fine.”(c)Q:There are three basic flavors of incentive: economic, social, and moral. Very often a single incentive scheme will include all three varieties. Think about the anti-smoking campaign of recent years. The addition of a $3-per-pack “sin tax” is a strong economic incentive against buying cigarettes. The banning of cigarettes in restaurants and bars is a powerful social incentive. And when the U.S. government asserts that terrorists raise money by selling black-market cigarettes, that acts as a rather jarring moral incentive.Some of the most compelling incentives yet invented have been put in place to deter crime. Considering this fact, it might be worthwhile to take a familiar question—why is there so much crime in modern society?—and stand it on its head: why isn’t there a lot more crime? After all, every one of us regularly passes up opportunities to maim, steal, and defraud. The chance of going to jail—thereby losing your job, your house, and your freedom, all of which are essentially economic penalties—is certainly a strong incentive. But when it comes to crime, people also respond to moral incentives (they don’t want to do something they consider wrong) and social incentives (they don’t want to be seen by others as doing something wrong). For certain types of misbehavior, social incentives are terribly powerful. In an echo of Hester Prynne’s scarlet letter, many American cities now fight prostitution with a “shaming” offensive, posting pictures of convicted johns (and prostitutes) on websites or on local-access television. Which is a more horrifying deterrent: a $500 fine for soliciting a prostitute or the thought of your friends and family ogling you on www.HookersAndJohns.com.(с)Q:Some cheating leaves barely a shadow of evidence. In other cases, the evidence is massive.Consider what happened one spring evening at midnight in 1987: seven million American childrensuddenly disappeared. The worst kidnapping wave in history? Hardly. It was the night of April 15,and the Internal Revenue Service had just changed a rule. Instead of merely listing each dependentchild, tax filers were now required to provide a Social Security number for each child. Suddenly,seven million children—children who had existed only as phantom exemptions on the previousyear’s 1040 forms—vanished, representing about one in ten of all dependent children in the UnitedStates(c)Q:Of all the ideas that Kennedy had thought up—and would think up in the future—to fight bigotry, his Superman campaign was easily the cleverest and probably the most productive. It had the precise effect he hoped: turning the Klan’s secrecy against itself, converting precious knowledgeinto ammunition for mockery. Instead of roping in millions of members as it had just a generationearlier, the Klan lost momentum and began to founder. Although the Klan would never quite die,especially down South—David Duke, a smooth-talking Klan leader from Louisiana, mountedlegitimate bids for the U.S. Senate and other offices—it was also never quite the same. In The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America, the historian Wyn Craig Wade calls Stetson Kennedy “the single most important factor in preventing a postwar revival of the Ku Klux Klan in the North.”This did not happen because Kennedy was courageous or resolute or unflappable, even though he was all of these. It happened because Kennedy understood the raw power of information. The Ku Klux Klan was a group whose power—much like that of politicians or real-estate agents or stockbrokers—was derived in large part from the fact that it hoarded information. Once that information falls into the wrong hands (or, depending on your point of view, the right hands), much of the group’s advantage disappears.(с)Q:Information is so powerful that the assumption of information, even if the information does not actually exist, can have a sobering effect.(c)Q:It is common for one party to a transaction to have better information than another party. Inthe parlance of economists, such a case is known as an information asymmetry. We accept as averity of capitalism that someone (usually an expert) knows more than someone else (usually aconsumer). (c)Q:If you were to assume that many experts use their information to your detriment, you’d beright. Experts depend on the fact that you don’t have the information they do. Or that you are sobefuddled by the complexity of their operation that you wouldn’t know what to do with theinformation if you had it. Or that you are so in awe of their expertise that you wouldn’t darechallenge them. If your doctor suggests that you have angioplasty—even though some currentresearch suggests that angioplasty often does little to prevent heart attacks—you aren’t likely tothink that the doctor is using his informational advantage to make a few thousand dollars forhimself or his buddy. But as David Hillis, an interventional cardiologist at the University of TexasSouthwestern Medical Center in Dallas, explained to the New York Times, a doctor may have thesame economic incentives as a car salesman or a funeral director or a mutual fund manager: “Ifyou’re an invasive cardiologist and Joe Smith, the local internist, is sending you patients, and if youtell them they don’t need the procedure, pretty soon Joe Smith doesn’t send patients anymore.”(c)Q:Consider this true story, related by John Donohue, a law professor who in 2001 was teaching at Stanford University: “I was just about to buy a house on the Stanford campus,” he recalls, “and the seller’s agent kept telling me what a good deal I was getting because the market was about to zoom. As soon as I signed the purchase contract, he asked me if I would need an agent to sell my previous Stanford house. I told him that I would probably try to sell without an agent, and he replied, ‘John, that might work under normal conditions, but with the market tanking now, you really need the help of a broker.’”Within five minutes, a zooming market had tanked. Such are the marvels that can be conjured by an agent in search of the next deal.(c)Q:They were also a lot richer, taller, skinnier, and better-looking than average. That, at least, is what they wrote about themselves. More than 4 percent of the online daters claimed to earn more than $200,000 a year, whereas fewer than 1 percent of typical Internet users actually earn that much, suggesting that three of the four big earners were exaggerating. Male and female users typically reported that they are about an inch taller than the national average. As for weight, the men were in line with the national average, but the women typically said they weighed about twenty pounds less than the national average.Most impressively, fully 70 percent of the women claimed “above average” looks, including 24 percent claiming “very good looks.” The online men too were gorgeous: 67 percent called themselves “above average,” including 21 percent with “very good looks.” This leaves only about 30 percent of the users with “average” looks, including a paltry 1 percent with “less than average” looks—which suggests that the typical online dater is either a fabulist, a narcissist, or simply resistant to the meaning of “average.” (Or perhaps they are all just realists: as any real-estate agent knows, the typical house isn’t “charming” or “fantastic,” but unless you say it is, no one will even bother to take a look.) Twenty-eight percent of the women on the site said they were blond, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dyeing, or lying, or both. Some users, meanwhile, were bracingly honest. Eight percent of the men—about 1 in every 12 conceded that they were married, with half of these 8 percent reporting that they were “happily married.” But the fact that they were honest doesn’t mean they were rash. Of the 258 “happily married” men in the sample, only 9 chose to post a picture of themselves. The reward of gaining a mistress was evidently outweighed by the risk of having your wife discover your personal ad. (c)Q:But if there is no unifying theme to Freakonomics, there is at least a common thread running through the everyday application of Freakonomics. It has to do with thinking sensibly about how people behave in the real world. All it requires is a novel way of looking, of discerning, of measuring. This isn’t necessarily a difficult task, nor does it require supersophisticated thinking. We have essentially tried to figure out what the typical gang member or sumo wrestler figured out on his own (although we had to do so in reverse).Will the ability to think such thoughts improve your life materially? Probably not. Perhaps you’ll put up a sturdy gate around your swimming pool or push your real-estate agent to work a little harder. But the net effect is likely to be more subtle than that. You might become more skeptical of the conventional wisdom; you may begin looking for hints as to how things aren’t quite what they seem; perhaps you will seek out some trove of data and sift through it, balancing your intelligence and your intuition to arrive at a glimmering new idea. Some of these ideas might make you uncomfortable, even unpopular. To claim that legalized abortion resulted in a massive drop in crime will inevitably lead to explosive moral reactions. (c)"

Pretty interesting how much he dislikes criminologists but then (if I remember correctly), only mentions the same one or two names over and over when giving examples of criminologists that had agendas/tricked the public. Also the fact that the entire book, and the issues, feels very simplified. Actually the author puts it best himself: ""The typical parenting expert, like experts in other fields, is prone to sound exceedingly sure of himself. An expert doesn’t so much argue the various sides of an issue, as plant his flag firmly on one side. That’s because an expert who’s argument reeks of restraint or nuance often doesn’t get much attention. An expert must be bold if he hopes to alchemise (?) his homespun theory into conventional wisdom."" This is often how I perceived the book to be written, very simplified, without enough nuance or room for possible explanations - only one right answer. I didn't like how the book was written, how the topics where dealt with, and had a hard time taking anything seriously after all of the self-admiration and the repeated ""all experts have agendas (except for us)"" talk in every chapter.

Even for someone like me whose general response to economics is *snore*. And it's mainly because Freakonomics is not really about economics, but involves applying statistical analysis to many social issues and questions. Very easy to read. Lots of shocking discoveries that seem weighted in fact - Roe v. Wade is responsible for a huge drop in crime? No wonder some people are pissed off with this book. It's really quite fascinating to look at the power of incentives - economic, social and moral - and examine cause and effect. One of my favourite personal experiences with silly notions of cause and effect is diet soft drinks. I confess to being a bit of a coke zero addict. It's not great for you (the sodium makes you more thirsty, a lot of potassium can lead to palpitations, and a lot of phosphoric acid has been linked to kidney problems) but I've lost count of how many times people have cited statistics showing that diet soda drinkers are more likely to be overweight and diabetic. Of course they are! If you're overweight and diabetic you're more likely to drink the low-calorie, sugar-free alternatives, aren't you? So strange how people assume it is A that causes B and ignore the possibility of it being the opposite.Anyway, my issue with this entertaining book is that I think it may be - to be frank - bullshit. Not all of it, sure. But definitely some of it. The writers state their points very confidently (some might say with a touch too much smarm) but it requires you to take a lot of what they say on faith. And some of the jumps they make between statistics and conclusion don't quite add up for me. I know many others have felt the same.But here was the thing that really got me, the thing that made me smell bullshit: I'm fairly confident something they said is not rooted in any truth. And let's be clear: I am a total noob when it comes to most statistics and economics, so if even I can spot something a bit off, it really makes me question the rest of it. Here it is:
Women's rights advocates, for instance, have hyped the incidence of sexual assault, claiming that one in three American women will in her lifetime be a victim of rape or attempted rape. (The actual figure is more like one in eight - but the advocates know it would take a callous person to publicly dispute their claims.)
This, if true, implies two things. 1) Those advocating women's rights are using false data, therefore undermining their credibility, and 2) They have invented a statistic to intentionally support their cause, knowing no one will dispute it (absolutely bizarre that the author thinks no one is disputing women's rights claims, but okay...)Well, being a feminist and someone who has spent an awful lot of time reading and writing about women's rights organizations and statistics, my eyes narrowed a little. See, in all my research, I've never seen or heard any claim that ""1 in 3 women will be a victim of rape or attempted rape"". I have heard the ""1 in 3"" statistic, but a somewhat different one.So, obviously, I went to look it up. I spent a couple of hours going through Google and every women's rights organization page I could find, trying to uncover a single case where that statistic was used. I found exactly: none. The only other thing I found that mentioned it was a Time article attempting to debunk so-called ""feminist myths"": http://time.com/3222543/5-feminist-my...The statistic the authors appear to have misquoted is that ""1 in 3 women will experience sexual violence, or physical violence by an intimate partner"", which is used often. Sexual violence here is an ambiguous term, leaving room for wider interpretations and probably explaining why, with the addition of domestic violence into the statistic, the number is at ""1 in 3"" instead of ""1 in 8"". Furthermore, not only have the authors misrepresented the statistical claim itself, but they have also suggested that women's rights advocates have pulled the numbers from thin air to make a point - on the contrary, this is a study conducted by the World Health Organization on the ""Global and regional estimates of violence against women"".I like the idea of the book, but this really put me off. Perhaps it was a one-off error that I managed to spot. Perhaps. Either way, I started to be less impressed by the facts and statistics they presented. Still, very enjoyable book for the most part."

I’d like to think that the stories told by the authors and the way they analyze conventional thinking would put me on a path to look past easy answers. Having completed Freakonomics, do I look at the world radically differently than I did before picking up the book? It is Interesting to look at subjects from a different angle. Positing that economics and specifically the field of study now dubbed freakonomics has nothing to do with morality is an intriguing concept as well, but deciding which stories to tell is necessarily selective.

He does this all through examining statistics and data, trying to find facts to back up various assertions rather than relying on conventional wisdom.The Good:As a person who is sick of the inability of most people to have a rational discourse on any even vaguely politicized topic, and a self-proclaimed skeptic, it’s nice to read anyone who endorses looking at hard data to make judgments about possibly controversial issues. Levitt does a nice job of not only proclaiming the advantages of this sort of rational outlook, but also of showing that when you actually examine the data, you sometimes get surprising results. Furthermore, he takes the time to point out that there is a difference between correlation and causation, and that many people mistake one for the other. Again, a nice touch.The actual questions that Levitt asks are all fairly interesting, though some will appeal to certain readers more than others. In addition to cheating sumotori and strange names, Levitt also examines cheating teachers, the economics of crack dealers, and the effect of abortion on crime. Crime, in point of fact, seems to be Levitt’s greatest interest, and I wonder if he might not have been better served by writing an entire book on the relationship between economics and crime, as opposed to trying to touch on a number of different subjects that are all largely unrelated. It might have made for a tighter, more focused book.The writing is solid; simple and easy, but solid. Despite being a book about economics, it’s not a terribly dense read, as witnessed by the fact that I finished it off in about two days. Granted, it was two days of heavy reading, but it was still two days.The Bad:For a book that’s so gung ho about statistics, there aren’t many statistics in here. Levitt claims that the numbers back up his research, but he rarely provides the data itself, which makes it difficult to tell how much he might be manipulating statistics to serve his own ends. It makes the book seem like it’s been dumbed down for the plebian masses, which will be very frustrating to any intelligent reader who wants to look at Levitt’s data themselves. Any reader who doesn’t feel like reading the numbers can do what most of us did in undergrad—skip the numbers sections. It’s just sloppy; I can’t imagine Levitt would do this in a formal economics paper.The book also lacks much in the way of an unifying theme, a problem that is acknowledged within the text itself; that isn’t only sad, it’s sloppy. I doubt that a writer of Dubner’s skill and an economist of Levitt’s apparent genius (more on that below) are totally incapable of thinking of and describing some kind of unifying theme throughout this work. It just smacks of laziness, even more so when there’s a half-hearted “well, I guess you could say it’s this…” sort of thing in the epilogue. Again, I have trouble imagining that Levitt would submit a paper that was this disjointed to a serious economic publication; why should the general public be treated less seriously?The Ugly:The self-aggrandizement. Oh, the self-aggrandizement.Every chapter is preceded by excerpts from an article about Levitt, which all tell us what a brilliant and unconventional economist this man is. In the introduction, we’re told that he really wasn’t that interested in writing a book, unless he got to work with this wonderful journalist who had written an article about him earlier. The cover promises that we will be “dazzled” by a “rogue economist” who explains “the hidden side of everything.”For all of this talk of brilliance and dazzling explanations, the book doesn’t seem that brilliant. It seems like a transcript of some interesting dinner conversation with a smart guy, the sort that makes you go home and think, “hey, this stuff is interesting, I ought to go pick up a book about it.” Of course, the problem here is that you’ve already picked up the book.The fact that Levitt wasn’t that interested in writing a book in the first place is telling; this book feels like something written by a person who needed to get the work done, but really wasn’t engaged in what he was doing. Maybe he should have waited until he was a little more motivated."

This is an awful book, yes I read the whole thing, like bitter medicine to a toddler, and had to see what the fuss was about.This Amazon review nails it.  Here's my review/rant. I'm reading this is 2012, maybe the hype in 2005 was different and people ate this kind of stuff up, even then I don't think we were that gullible at this time. There were good social science/stats books out there. This book pales in comparison to the works of Malcolm Gladwell and others. Levitt is making something out of nothing from strange stories he heard, now he's stitching them together suggesting there's a *GASP* hidden side to everything. Because the KKK spoke in code, real estate listings are supposedly in code, and we're all being duped into spending more for our house because of the secret speak between realtors! How about consumers don't just read a real estate listings but check a place out before making the biggest purchase of their lives, one could argue there's secret speak in every industry. For his final chapter (which is in the middle of the book) Levitt's grand finale, Black people name their children differently to White people! The second half of the book is blog posts from their blog more atrocious reading from these ranting lunatics. There's no appeal to science, Levitt is throwing a lot of his own opinion, and making wild estimations and bringing up even wilder conclusions. It's pretty obvious Levitt is a shrewd businessman, he's not just writing books, but has a well to do following with his blog, radio station and yes even movie! This is ""easy to consume"" garbage for the masses. "

I tried so very hard to finish reading this book full of BS facts but eventually got so tired of hearing things that just are not true but the author ""claims"" to be fact, that I quit reading it. I almost finished but couldn't do it in the end. Some of the things the author talks about seem like they could be truths but the majority of it is not. Don't waste your time. Update: I don't recall the specifics as this was over a year ago that I ""attempted"" to read the book. I don't remember how far I got through it before I stopped reading. I can recall that many of the data and ideas presented about crime statistics and correlations were not accurate. The book put claims on cause and effect in regards to violent crime. I knew that the correlations were no more then the Authors conclusion based on one view of statistical data use. The use of statistics is often (many times not on purpose) biased. I have studied and been in law enforcement since 1990 and have worked serious felony level crimes since 1999. I know from experience and studies that some of the ideas he presented as ""fact"" were not fact but more of an opinion that can be easily concluded when someone does not look at the entire data of violent crimes."

Even worse is the impression given that the background research is astonishingly thorough and accurate. It is not. Don't take their word for it on anything. A quick Google search yields rebuttals from true experts in the various fields that effectively point out flaws in their quotes, facts, and logic. I love that they promote the ideas of critical thinking. I love that they promote the idea of thorough research and questioning the status quo. I love that they promote use of numbers and statistics to explore ideas in an attempt to find the truth. But I wish that they were providing as good of a demonstration of the principles as they claim to be.Their conclusions are then presented as irrefutable, as if they are a magic bullet of the truth, rather than a heartfelt (presumably) effort at finding truth, subject to revision based on refined thought or background research. And then there is the assignment of cause to correlation...... In at least some cases, I am not convinced that it is truth that they are after so much as their own agenda (on oh so many levels).

90,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934648-jim,1,"This was an interesting book. I say it was interesting because I started liking it (a lot) when I first read it, as time passed I liked it less and less. In that way I call it a candy book, tastes good at first but leaves you worse off for reading it. In my opinion, there are two problems with the book: First, Stephen Dubner comes across as a sycophant. Way to much of the book is spent praising Levitt. Secondly, I was disappointed in the lack of detail provided about Livitt's hypothesis. I wanted more. It was like reading War and Peace and discovering that you read the abridged version and in fact the book wasn't 100 pages long. This disappointment may have come from my engineering background and my strong desire to really understand economics. This book didn't offer any of that, only a titillating glimpse of the economics. In some regards one may think my single start rating is to harsh. As mind candy this book was quite good. I did enjoy reading it at the time. Whats more, it did encourage me to study real economics. I am currently enrolled in a masters program in economics and this book did play a very small roll in that decision process. However, as I learn more about economics I realize how shallow the book in fact was. While this is not the forum for a comprehensive review of the topics presented in the book, or an analysis of how good the economics in Freekanomics are, a review in ""Journal of Economic Literature (Vol XLV, Dec. 2007 pp 973)"" quotes Livitt as saying: ""There is no question I have written some ridiculous papers."" The article then goes on to quote a paper by Noam Scheibler(2007) describing Livitt's comparing some of his papers to the fashion industry. ""Sometimes you write papers and they're less about the actual result, more about your vision of how you think the profession should be. And so I think some of my most ridiculous papers actually fall in the high-fashion category."""

But ultimately I think most of what Leavitt claims is crap. He dodges accoutability with the disclaimer about his book NOT being a scholarly work, but then goes on to drop statistics, theories and expert opinions. These assertions laid, he doesn't provide readers with enough information to critically examine his perspectives.Ultimately I have a problem with the unquestioned, unaccoutable role of the public intellectual. Leavitt dances around with his PhD on his sleeve, but is never subject to peer review or any sort of academic criticism. I think it's irresponsible. "
92,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"I loved this book, though I think the title is a bit misleading. It's not really about economics. In fact, he's showing you what interesting things you can discover when you apply statistical analysis to problems where you wouldn't normally think of using it. I use statistical methods a fair amount in my own work, so I found it particularly interesting. The most startling and thought-provoking example is definitely the unexpected reduction in US urban crime that occurred towards the end of the 20th century. Crime rates had been rising for decades, and people were really worried about what would happen if the trend continued. Then, suddenly, they peaked and started to decline. Why? There were a bunch of theories, all of them superficially plausible.Levitt crunched the numbers, to see what proportion of the variance could be ascribed to the different factors. This is a completely standard technique; it just hadn't been used here before. He came to the conclusion that the single most important factor, by far, was the ready availability of abortion that started to come in after Roe v Wade. Other things, like more resources for policing and tougher sentencing policies, probably helped, but not nearly as much. I didn't at all get the impression that he had been expecting this result from the start, and just wanted to prove his point. He processed the data, and went where the numbers led him. That's how you're supposed to do science.The clincher, at least as far as I was concerned, was the fact that crime statistics peaked at different points in different states, the peaks correlating very well with the dates when each state started making abortion available. States that brought it in early had correspondingly early peaks in their crime rates. It's hard to see how that could happen if Levitt's explanation weren't correct.I am surprised that there hasn't been more discussion of Levitt's findings in the political world. Maybe it's just regarded as too hot to handle. But if Levitt is right, and at the moment I would say it's up to his critics to explain why he isn't, then pro-life campaigners would seem be heading in a very unfortunate direction."

94,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33765-justin,4,"I guess some people don't like this book because it's not centered around one theme. Instead, it's more about the seemingly diffuse academic work of one of the authors Steven D. Levitt (the other author is a journalist, Stephen J. Dubner). Levitt is something of an economist but more like a social scientist using the tools of Microeconomics applied to other fields that happen to catch his interest (often having something to do with cheating, corruption, crime, etc.). In the back of the book he mentions how he considers himself a student of Thomas Schelling who is kind of like the father of Game Theory (strategy theory?), except much more of a 'man of ideas' than what one might think of when one thinks about game theory today, which is much more mathematical. Anyway, as for the book itself, I thought it was really great. I really like what Levitt is doing as far as using the tools of Microeconomics in other fields. One of my intellectual heroes (I only have a few) is Kenneth Waltz who did the exact same thing in the field of International Relations in the '70's and wrote the seminal book The Theory of International Politics, which pretty much the single-handedly invented defensive (neo) realism. More generally, I think Economics is probably the most formalized of the social sciences and the one to which others should esteem. A lot of the Political Science field concerned with both voter behavior and how legislatures work is now pretty formalized as well, and, I, for one, think this is a good thing. I don't see how anyone could think it's not (good) unless they a)think the scientific method cannot be used to analyze human behavior; or b)have a visceral aversion to mathematical languages. Actually, I am one of the latter, but I, at least, see the value in having a formalized language to work with.As for the book itself, there's some maybe-controversial things in there like Levitt did some work that showed that the legalization of abortion in the U.S. (Roe v. Wade) was one of the main reasons that crime in the U.S. dropped in the '90's and continues at the same rates today. He stands behind it pretty hardily though and it doesn't seem like he has a moral agenda at all. Some might argue that the best writers are those who are best able to disguise their moral agenda, but considering he writes about all kinds of not-very-serious things like how sumo wrestling in Japan is probably corrupt as far as matches g,o and there's stuff in there about how real estate agents sell their houses for more than they sell their customers' houses (which, may or may not be surprising), I really don't think he has a hidden pro-life agenda. Anyway, there's a bunch of stuff in there (the book), hence the 'freak' in Freakonomics. It's well-written. It's not dry. It's written for a lay audience. I recommend it. Read it and feel the power of social science! ;-)"

I did, however, learn from this book. It still amazes me that the way to reduce crime seems to be the legalization of abortion. I did not expect that, but it does make quite a lot of sense and I’m all for women having control over their own bodies and futures, of course. Sidenote: I despised the author’s arbitrary uses of female and male pronouns. Like, a teacher is a SHE and then an architect a HE? That certainly didn’t gain my respect."

The story sounds at least partially made up. It then jumped into predictable white guilt inducing trash and goes into mental contortions using ""data"" and sociological explanations for black criminality and low IQ scores. The writers of this book are also obsessively pro-Abortion. The only surprise was they used statistics to show you are much more likely to die from an automobile or a swimming pool than a gun.

This is a book about the world and not about any science in particular. It's about learning to question the given and see beyond the obvious. An extremely useful gift in the misguiding modern world.Yeah, populistic much too much but neverthless compulsively readable. A definite revisit and reread.Q:As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions. His particular gift is the ability to ask such questions. For instance: If drug dealers make so much money, why do they still live with their mothers? Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What really caused crime rates to plunge during the past decade? Do real-estate agents have their clients’ best interests at heart? Why do black parents give their children names that may hurt their career prospects? Do schoolteachers cheat to meet high-stakes testing standards? Is sumo wrestling corrupt?And how does a homeless man in tattered clothing afford $50 headphones?(c)Q:the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and—if the right questions are asked—is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking.(c)Q:“Experts”—from criminologists to real-estate agents-use their informational advantage to serve their own agenda. However, they can be beat at their own game. And in the face of the Internet, their informational advantage is shrinking every day-as evidenced by, among other things, the falling price of coffins and life-insurance premiums.Knowing what to measure and how to measure it makes a complicated world much less so. If you learn how to look at data in the right way, you can explain riddles that otherwise might have seemed impossible. Because there is nothing like the sheer power of numbers to scrub away layers of confusion and contradiction.So the aim of this book is to explore the hidden side of . . . everything. This may occasionally be a frustrating exercise. It may sometimes feel as if we are peering at the world through a straw or even staring into a funhouse mirror; but the idea is to look at many different scenarios and examine them in a way they have rarely been examined....Steven Levitt may not fully believe in himself, but he does believe in this: teachers and criminals and real-estate agents may lie, and politicians, and even CIA analysts. But numbers don’t.(c)Q:Levitt had an interview for the Society of Fellows, the venerable intellectual clubhouse atHarvard that pays young scholars to do their own work, for three years, with no commitments.Levitt felt he didn’t stand a chance. For starters, he didn’t consider himself an intellectual. He wouldbe interviewed over dinner by the senior fellows, a collection of world-renowned philosophers,scientists, and historians. He worried he wouldn’t have enough conversation to last even the firstcourse.Disquietingly, one of the senior fellows said to Levitt, “I’m having a hard time seeing theunifying theme of your work. Could you explain it?”Levitt was stymied. He had no idea what his unifying theme was, or if he even had one.Amartya Sen, the future Nobel-winning economist, jumped in and neatly summarized what hesaw as Levitt’s theme.Yes, Levitt said eagerly, that’s my theme.Another fellow then offered another theme.You’re right, said Levitt, my theme.And so it went, like dogs tugging at a bone, until the philosopher Robert Nozick interrupted.“How old are you, Steve?” he asked.“Twenty-six.”Nozick turned to the other fellows: “He’s twenty-six years old. Why does he need to have aunifying theme? Maybe he’s going to be one of those people who’s so talented he doesn’t need one.He’ll take a question and he’ll just answer it, and it’ll be fine.”(c)Q:There are three basic flavors of incentive: economic, social, and moral. Very often a single incentive scheme will include all three varieties. Think about the anti-smoking campaign of recent years. The addition of a $3-per-pack “sin tax” is a strong economic incentive against buying cigarettes. The banning of cigarettes in restaurants and bars is a powerful social incentive. And when the U.S. government asserts that terrorists raise money by selling black-market cigarettes, that acts as a rather jarring moral incentive.Some of the most compelling incentives yet invented have been put in place to deter crime. Considering this fact, it might be worthwhile to take a familiar question—why is there so much crime in modern society?—and stand it on its head: why isn’t there a lot more crime? After all, every one of us regularly passes up opportunities to maim, steal, and defraud. The chance of going to jail—thereby losing your job, your house, and your freedom, all of which are essentially economic penalties—is certainly a strong incentive. But when it comes to crime, people also respond to moral incentives (they don’t want to do something they consider wrong) and social incentives (they don’t want to be seen by others as doing something wrong). For certain types of misbehavior, social incentives are terribly powerful. In an echo of Hester Prynne’s scarlet letter, many American cities now fight prostitution with a “shaming” offensive, posting pictures of convicted johns (and prostitutes) on websites or on local-access television. Which is a more horrifying deterrent: a $500 fine for soliciting a prostitute or the thought of your friends and family ogling you on www.HookersAndJohns.com.(с)Q:Some cheating leaves barely a shadow of evidence. In other cases, the evidence is massive.Consider what happened one spring evening at midnight in 1987: seven million American childrensuddenly disappeared. The worst kidnapping wave in history? Hardly. It was the night of April 15,and the Internal Revenue Service had just changed a rule. Instead of merely listing each dependentchild, tax filers were now required to provide a Social Security number for each child. Suddenly,seven million children—children who had existed only as phantom exemptions on the previousyear’s 1040 forms—vanished, representing about one in ten of all dependent children in the UnitedStates(c)Q:Of all the ideas that Kennedy had thought up—and would think up in the future—to fight bigotry, his Superman campaign was easily the cleverest and probably the most productive. It had the precise effect he hoped: turning the Klan’s secrecy against itself, converting precious knowledgeinto ammunition for mockery. Instead of roping in millions of members as it had just a generationearlier, the Klan lost momentum and began to founder. Although the Klan would never quite die,especially down South—David Duke, a smooth-talking Klan leader from Louisiana, mountedlegitimate bids for the U.S. Senate and other offices—it was also never quite the same. In The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America, the historian Wyn Craig Wade calls Stetson Kennedy “the single most important factor in preventing a postwar revival of the Ku Klux Klan in the North.”This did not happen because Kennedy was courageous or resolute or unflappable, even though he was all of these. It happened because Kennedy understood the raw power of information. The Ku Klux Klan was a group whose power—much like that of politicians or real-estate agents or stockbrokers—was derived in large part from the fact that it hoarded information. Once that information falls into the wrong hands (or, depending on your point of view, the right hands), much of the group’s advantage disappears.(с)Q:Information is so powerful that the assumption of information, even if the information does not actually exist, can have a sobering effect.(c)Q:It is common for one party to a transaction to have better information than another party. Inthe parlance of economists, such a case is known as an information asymmetry. We accept as averity of capitalism that someone (usually an expert) knows more than someone else (usually aconsumer). (c)Q:If you were to assume that many experts use their information to your detriment, you’d beright. Experts depend on the fact that you don’t have the information they do. Or that you are sobefuddled by the complexity of their operation that you wouldn’t know what to do with theinformation if you had it. Or that you are so in awe of their expertise that you wouldn’t darechallenge them. If your doctor suggests that you have angioplasty—even though some currentresearch suggests that angioplasty often does little to prevent heart attacks—you aren’t likely tothink that the doctor is using his informational advantage to make a few thousand dollars forhimself or his buddy. But as David Hillis, an interventional cardiologist at the University of TexasSouthwestern Medical Center in Dallas, explained to the New York Times, a doctor may have thesame economic incentives as a car salesman or a funeral director or a mutual fund manager: “Ifyou’re an invasive cardiologist and Joe Smith, the local internist, is sending you patients, and if youtell them they don’t need the procedure, pretty soon Joe Smith doesn’t send patients anymore.”(c)Q:Consider this true story, related by John Donohue, a law professor who in 2001 was teaching at Stanford University: “I was just about to buy a house on the Stanford campus,” he recalls, “and the seller’s agent kept telling me what a good deal I was getting because the market was about to zoom. As soon as I signed the purchase contract, he asked me if I would need an agent to sell my previous Stanford house. I told him that I would probably try to sell without an agent, and he replied, ‘John, that might work under normal conditions, but with the market tanking now, you really need the help of a broker.’”Within five minutes, a zooming market had tanked. Such are the marvels that can be conjured by an agent in search of the next deal.(c)Q:They were also a lot richer, taller, skinnier, and better-looking than average. That, at least, is what they wrote about themselves. More than 4 percent of the online daters claimed to earn more than $200,000 a year, whereas fewer than 1 percent of typical Internet users actually earn that much, suggesting that three of the four big earners were exaggerating. Male and female users typically reported that they are about an inch taller than the national average. As for weight, the men were in line with the national average, but the women typically said they weighed about twenty pounds less than the national average.Most impressively, fully 70 percent of the women claimed “above average” looks, including 24 percent claiming “very good looks.” The online men too were gorgeous: 67 percent called themselves “above average,” including 21 percent with “very good looks.” This leaves only about 30 percent of the users with “average” looks, including a paltry 1 percent with “less than average” looks—which suggests that the typical online dater is either a fabulist, a narcissist, or simply resistant to the meaning of “average.” (Or perhaps they are all just realists: as any real-estate agent knows, the typical house isn’t “charming” or “fantastic,” but unless you say it is, no one will even bother to take a look.) Twenty-eight percent of the women on the site said they were blond, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dyeing, or lying, or both. Some users, meanwhile, were bracingly honest. Eight percent of the men—about 1 in every 12 conceded that they were married, with half of these 8 percent reporting that they were “happily married.” But the fact that they were honest doesn’t mean they were rash. Of the 258 “happily married” men in the sample, only 9 chose to post a picture of themselves. The reward of gaining a mistress was evidently outweighed by the risk of having your wife discover your personal ad. (c)Q:But if there is no unifying theme to Freakonomics, there is at least a common thread running through the everyday application of Freakonomics. It has to do with thinking sensibly about how people behave in the real world. All it requires is a novel way of looking, of discerning, of measuring. This isn’t necessarily a difficult task, nor does it require supersophisticated thinking. We have essentially tried to figure out what the typical gang member or sumo wrestler figured out on his own (although we had to do so in reverse).Will the ability to think such thoughts improve your life materially? Probably not. Perhaps you’ll put up a sturdy gate around your swimming pool or push your real-estate agent to work a little harder. But the net effect is likely to be more subtle than that. You might become more skeptical of the conventional wisdom; you may begin looking for hints as to how things aren’t quite what they seem; perhaps you will seek out some trove of data and sift through it, balancing your intelligence and your intuition to arrive at a glimmering new idea. Some of these ideas might make you uncomfortable, even unpopular. To claim that legalized abortion resulted in a massive drop in crime will inevitably lead to explosive moral reactions. (c)"

Pretty interesting how much he dislikes criminologists but then (if I remember correctly), only mentions the same one or two names over and over when giving examples of criminologists that had agendas/tricked the public. Also the fact that the entire book, and the issues, feels very simplified. Actually the author puts it best himself: ""The typical parenting expert, like experts in other fields, is prone to sound exceedingly sure of himself. An expert doesn’t so much argue the various sides of an issue, as plant his flag firmly on one side. That’s because an expert who’s argument reeks of restraint or nuance often doesn’t get much attention. An expert must be bold if he hopes to alchemise (?) his homespun theory into conventional wisdom."" This is often how I perceived the book to be written, very simplified, without enough nuance or room for possible explanations - only one right answer. I didn't like how the book was written, how the topics where dealt with, and had a hard time taking anything seriously after all of the self-admiration and the repeated ""all experts have agendas (except for us)"" talk in every chapter.

105,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,3,"I won't deny that this is a very interesting, compelling and thought-provoking book. Even for someone like me whose general response to economics is *snore*. And it's mainly because Freakonomics is not really about economics, but involves applying statistical analysis to many social issues and questions. Very easy to read. Lots of shocking discoveries that seem weighted in fact - Roe v. Wade is responsible for a huge drop in crime? No wonder some people are pissed off with this book. It's really quite fascinating to look at the power of incentives - economic, social and moral - and examine cause and effect. One of my favourite personal experiences with silly notions of cause and effect is diet soft drinks. I confess to being a bit of a coke zero addict. It's not great for you (the sodium makes you more thirsty, a lot of potassium can lead to palpitations, and a lot of phosphoric acid has been linked to kidney problems) but I've lost count of how many times people have cited statistics showing that diet soda drinkers are more likely to be overweight and diabetic. Of course they are! If you're overweight and diabetic you're more likely to drink the low-calorie, sugar-free alternatives, aren't you? So strange how people assume it is A that causes B and ignore the possibility of it being the opposite.Anyway, my issue with this entertaining book is that I think it may be - to be frank - bullshit. Not all of it, sure. But definitely some of it. The writers state their points very confidently (some might say with a touch too much smarm) but it requires you to take a lot of what they say on faith. And some of the jumps they make between statistics and conclusion don't quite add up for me. I know many others have felt the same.But here was the thing that really got me, the thing that made me smell bullshit: I'm fairly confident something they said is not rooted in any truth. And let's be clear: I am a total noob when it comes to most statistics and economics, so if even I can spot something a bit off, it really makes me question the rest of it. Here it is:
Women's rights advocates, for instance, have hyped the incidence of sexual assault, claiming that one in three American women will in her lifetime be a victim of rape or attempted rape. (The actual figure is more like one in eight - but the advocates know it would take a callous person to publicly dispute their claims.)
This, if true, implies two things. 1) Those advocating women's rights are using false data, therefore undermining their credibility, and 2) They have invented a statistic to intentionally support their cause, knowing no one will dispute it (absolutely bizarre that the author thinks no one is disputing women's rights claims, but okay...)Well, being a feminist and someone who has spent an awful lot of time reading and writing about women's rights organizations and statistics, my eyes narrowed a little. See, in all my research, I've never seen or heard any claim that ""1 in 3 women will be a victim of rape or attempted rape"". I have heard the ""1 in 3"" statistic, but a somewhat different one.So, obviously, I went to look it up. I spent a couple of hours going through Google and every women's rights organization page I could find, trying to uncover a single case where that statistic was used. I found exactly: none. The only other thing I found that mentioned it was a Time article attempting to debunk so-called ""feminist myths"": http://time.com/3222543/5-feminist-my...The statistic the authors appear to have misquoted is that ""1 in 3 women will experience sexual violence, or physical violence by an intimate partner"", which is used often. Sexual violence here is an ambiguous term, leaving room for wider interpretations and probably explaining why, with the addition of domestic violence into the statistic, the number is at ""1 in 3"" instead of ""1 in 8"". Furthermore, not only have the authors misrepresented the statistical claim itself, but they have also suggested that women's rights advocates have pulled the numbers from thin air to make a point - on the contrary, this is a study conducted by the World Health Organization on the ""Global and regional estimates of violence against women"".I like the idea of the book, but this really put me off. Perhaps it was a one-off error that I managed to spot. Perhaps. Either way, I started to be less impressed by the facts and statistics they presented. Still, very enjoyable book for the most part."

Levitt and Dubner explore a diverse range of subjects: from linking Roe v. Wade to violent crime, cheating by teachers and sumo wrestlers to an economic model of drug dealing. I’d like to think that the stories told by the authors and the way they analyze conventional thinking would put me on a path to look past easy answers. Having completed Freakonomics, do I look at the world radically differently than I did before picking up the book? It is Interesting to look at subjects from a different angle. Positing that economics and specifically the field of study now dubbed freakonomics has nothing to do with morality is an intriguing concept as well, but deciding which stories to tell is necessarily selective. Indeed, the focus is interesting. So yes I enjoyed Freakonomics, but feel I should have more to say about it and the authors’ underlying premises than I do. 3.25 stars "

111,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/972904-jake,2,"The Basics:Freakonomics isn’t really about any one thing, which makes it a bit hard to summarize. In essence, it’s economist Steven Levitt playing around with economic principles and basic statistical analysis to examine various cultural trends and phenomena. He tackles a variety of questions, from whether or not sumo wrestlers cheat (they do) to whether or not a child’s name determines his success (it doesn’t). He does this all through examining statistics and data, trying to find facts to back up various assertions rather than relying on conventional wisdom.The Good:As a person who is sick of the inability of most people to have a rational discourse on any even vaguely politicized topic, and a self-proclaimed skeptic, it’s nice to read anyone who endorses looking at hard data to make judgments about possibly controversial issues. Levitt does a nice job of not only proclaiming the advantages of this sort of rational outlook, but also of showing that when you actually examine the data, you sometimes get surprising results. Furthermore, he takes the time to point out that there is a difference between correlation and causation, and that many people mistake one for the other. Again, a nice touch.The actual questions that Levitt asks are all fairly interesting, though some will appeal to certain readers more than others. In addition to cheating sumotori and strange names, Levitt also examines cheating teachers, the economics of crack dealers, and the effect of abortion on crime. Crime, in point of fact, seems to be Levitt’s greatest interest, and I wonder if he might not have been better served by writing an entire book on the relationship between economics and crime, as opposed to trying to touch on a number of different subjects that are all largely unrelated. It might have made for a tighter, more focused book.The writing is solid; simple and easy, but solid. Despite being a book about economics, it’s not a terribly dense read, as witnessed by the fact that I finished it off in about two days. Granted, it was two days of heavy reading, but it was still two days.The Bad:For a book that’s so gung ho about statistics, there aren’t many statistics in here. Levitt claims that the numbers back up his research, but he rarely provides the data itself, which makes it difficult to tell how much he might be manipulating statistics to serve his own ends. It makes the book seem like it’s been dumbed down for the plebian masses, which will be very frustrating to any intelligent reader who wants to look at Levitt’s data themselves. Any reader who doesn’t feel like reading the numbers can do what most of us did in undergrad—skip the numbers sections. It’s just sloppy; I can’t imagine Levitt would do this in a formal economics paper.The book also lacks much in the way of an unifying theme, a problem that is acknowledged within the text itself; that isn’t only sad, it’s sloppy. I doubt that a writer of Dubner’s skill and an economist of Levitt’s apparent genius (more on that below) are totally incapable of thinking of and describing some kind of unifying theme throughout this work. It just smacks of laziness, even more so when there’s a half-hearted “well, I guess you could say it’s this…” sort of thing in the epilogue. Again, I have trouble imagining that Levitt would submit a paper that was this disjointed to a serious economic publication; why should the general public be treated less seriously?The Ugly:The self-aggrandizement. Oh, the self-aggrandizement.Every chapter is preceded by excerpts from an article about Levitt, which all tell us what a brilliant and unconventional economist this man is. In the introduction, we’re told that he really wasn’t that interested in writing a book, unless he got to work with this wonderful journalist who had written an article about him earlier. The cover promises that we will be “dazzled” by a “rogue economist” who explains “the hidden side of everything.”For all of this talk of brilliance and dazzling explanations, the book doesn’t seem that brilliant. It seems like a transcript of some interesting dinner conversation with a smart guy, the sort that makes you go home and think, “hey, this stuff is interesting, I ought to go pick up a book about it.” Of course, the problem here is that you’ve already picked up the book.The fact that Levitt wasn’t that interested in writing a book in the first place is telling; this book feels like something written by a person who needed to get the work done, but really wasn’t engaged in what he was doing. Maybe he should have waited until he was a little more motivated."

I'm reading this is 2012, maybe the hype in 2005 was different and people ate this kind of stuff up, even then I don't think we were that gullible at this time. There were good social science/stats books out there. This book pales in comparison to the works of Malcolm Gladwell and others. Levitt is making something out of nothing from strange stories he heard, now he's stitching them together suggesting there's a *GASP* hidden side to everything. Because the KKK spoke in code, real estate listings are supposedly in code, and we're all being duped into spending more for our house because of the secret speak between realtors! How about consumers don't just read a real estate listings but check a place out before making the biggest purchase of their lives, one could argue there's secret speak in every industry. For his final chapter (which is in the middle of the book) Levitt's grand finale, Black people name their children differently to White people! The second half of the book is blog posts from their blog more atrocious reading from these ranting lunatics. There's no appeal to science, Levitt is throwing a lot of his own opinion, and making wild estimations and bringing up even wilder conclusions. It's pretty obvious Levitt is a shrewd businessman, he's not just writing books, but has a well to do following with his blog, radio station and yes even movie!

I knew that the correlations were no more then the Authors conclusion based on one view of statistical data use. The use of statistics is often (many times not on purpose) biased. I have studied and been in law enforcement since 1990 and have worked serious felony level crimes since 1999.

I say it was interesting because I started liking it (a lot) when I first read it, as time passed I liked it less and less. In that way I call it a candy book, tastes good at first but leaves you worse off for reading it. In my opinion, there are two problems with the book: First, Stephen Dubner comes across as a sycophant. Way to much of the book is spent praising Levitt. Secondly, I was disappointed in the lack of detail provided about Livitt's hypothesis. I wanted more. It was like reading War and Peace and discovering that you read the abridged version and in fact the book wasn't 100 pages long. This disappointment may have come from my engineering background and my strong desire to really understand economics. This book didn't offer any of that, only a titillating glimpse of the economics. In some regards one may think my single start rating is to harsh. As mind candy this book was quite good. I did enjoy reading it at the time. Whats more, it did encourage me to study real economics. I am currently enrolled in a masters program in economics and this book did play a very small roll in that decision process. However, as I learn more about economics I realize how shallow the book in fact was. While this is not the forum for a comprehensive review of the topics presented in the book, or an analysis of how good the economics in Freekanomics are, a review in ""Journal of Economic Literature (Vol XLV, Dec. 2007 pp 973)"" quotes Livitt as saying: ""There is no question I have written some ridiculous papers."" The article then goes on to quote a paper by Noam Scheibler(2007) describing Livitt's comparing some of his papers to the fashion industry. ""Sometimes you write papers and they're less about the actual result, more about your vision of how you think the profession should be. And so I think some of my most ridiculous papers actually fall in the high-fashion category."""

He dodges accoutability with the disclaimer about his book NOT being a scholarly work, but then goes on to drop statistics, theories and expert opinions. These assertions laid, he doesn't provide readers with enough information to critically examine his perspectives.Ultimately I have a problem with the unquestioned, unaccoutable role of the public intellectual. Leavitt dances around with his PhD on his sleeve, but is never subject to peer review or any sort of academic criticism. I think it's irresponsible. "
122,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"I loved this book, though I think the title is a bit misleading. It's not really about economics. In fact, he's showing you what interesting things you can discover when you apply statistical analysis to problems where you wouldn't normally think of using it. I use statistical methods a fair amount in my own work, so I found it particularly interesting. The most startling and thought-provoking example is definitely the unexpected reduction in US urban crime that occurred towards the end of the 20th century. Crime rates had been rising for decades, and people were really worried about what would happen if the trend continued. Then, suddenly, they peaked and started to decline. Why? There were a bunch of theories, all of them superficially plausible.Levitt crunched the numbers, to see what proportion of the variance could be ascribed to the different factors. This is a completely standard technique; it just hadn't been used here before. He came to the conclusion that the single most important factor, by far, was the ready availability of abortion that started to come in after Roe v Wade. Other things, like more resources for policing and tougher sentencing policies, probably helped, but not nearly as much. I didn't at all get the impression that he had been expecting this result from the start, and just wanted to prove his point. He processed the data, and went where the numbers led him. That's how you're supposed to do science.The clincher, at least as far as I was concerned, was the fact that crime statistics peaked at different points in different states, the peaks correlating very well with the dates when each state started making abortion available. States that brought it in early had correspondingly early peaks in their crime rates. It's hard to see how that could happen if Levitt's explanation weren't correct.I am surprised that there hasn't been more discussion of Levitt's findings in the political world. Maybe it's just regarded as too hot to handle. But if Levitt is right, and at the moment I would say it's up to his critics to explain why he isn't, then pro-life campaigners would seem be heading in a very unfortunate direction."

In the back of the book he mentions how he considers himself a student of Thomas Schelling who is kind of like the father of Game Theory (strategy theory?), except much more of a 'man of ideas' than what one might think of when one thinks about game theory today, which is much more mathematical. Anyway, as for the book itself, I thought it was really great. I really like what Levitt is doing as far as using the tools of Microeconomics in other fields. One of my intellectual heroes (I only have a few) is Kenneth Waltz who did the exact same thing in the field of International Relations in the '70's and wrote the seminal book The Theory of International Politics, which pretty much the single-handedly invented defensive (neo) realism. More generally, I think Economics is probably the most formalized of the social sciences and the one to which others should esteem. A lot of the Political Science field concerned with both voter behavior and how legislatures work is now pretty formalized as well, and, I, for one, think this is a good thing. I don't see how anyone could think it's not (good) unless they a)think the scientific method cannot be used to analyze human behavior; or b)have a visceral aversion to mathematical languages. Actually, I am one of the latter, but I, at least, see the value in having a formalized language to work with.As for the book itself, there's some maybe-controversial things in there like Levitt did some work that showed that the legalization of abortion in the U.S. (Roe v. Wade) was one of the main reasons that crime in the U.S. dropped in the '90's and continues at the same rates today. He stands behind it pretty hardily though and it doesn't seem like he has a moral agenda at all. Some might argue that the best writers are those who are best able to disguise their moral agenda, but considering he writes about all kinds of not-very-serious things like how sumo wrestling in Japan is probably corrupt as far as matches g,o and there's stuff in there about how real estate agents sell their houses for more than they sell their customers' houses (which, may or may not be surprising), I really don't think he has a hidden pro-life agenda. Anyway, there's a bunch of stuff in there (the book), hence the 'freak' in Freakonomics. It's well-written. It's not dry. It's written for a lay audience. I recommend it. Read it and feel the power of social science! ;-)"

I did, however, learn from this book. It still amazes me that the way to reduce crime seems to be the legalization of abortion. I did not expect that, but it does make quite a lot of sense and I’m all for women having control over their own bodies and futures, of course. Sidenote: I despised the author’s arbitrary uses of female and male pronouns. Like, a teacher is a SHE and then an architect a HE? That certainly didn’t gain my respect."

I quickly realized what I was in for when early in the book when the authors gave their background as Harvard Jews and profiled a guy that infiltrated the KKK for the ADL. The story sounds at least partially made up. It then jumped into predictable white guilt inducing trash and goes into mental contortions using ""data"" and sociological explanations for black criminality and low IQ scores. The writers of this book are also obsessively pro-Abortion. The only surprise was they used statistics to show you are much more likely to die from an automobile or a swimming pool than a gun. This book would probably appeal to upper middle class liberals who like to consider themselves clever and politically astute from their isolated armchairs. For me Freakonomics was a big load of garbage."
128,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,5,"Extremely enlightening! Worthy of 15 stars out of 5! This is a book about the world and not about any science in particular. It's about learning to question the given and see beyond the obvious. An extremely useful gift in the misguiding modern world.Yeah, populistic much too much but neverthless compulsively readable. A definite revisit and reread.Q:As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions. His particular gift is the ability to ask such questions. For instance: If drug dealers make so much money, why do they still live with their mothers? Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What really caused crime rates to plunge during the past decade? Do real-estate agents have their clients’ best interests at heart? Why do black parents give their children names that may hurt their career prospects? Do schoolteachers cheat to meet high-stakes testing standards? Is sumo wrestling corrupt?And how does a homeless man in tattered clothing afford $50 headphones?(c)Q:the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and—if the right questions are asked—is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking.(c)Q:“Experts”—from criminologists to real-estate agents-use their informational advantage to serve their own agenda. However, they can be beat at their own game. And in the face of the Internet, their informational advantage is shrinking every day-as evidenced by, among other things, the falling price of coffins and life-insurance premiums.Knowing what to measure and how to measure it makes a complicated world much less so. If you learn how to look at data in the right way, you can explain riddles that otherwise might have seemed impossible. Because there is nothing like the sheer power of numbers to scrub away layers of confusion and contradiction.So the aim of this book is to explore the hidden side of . . . everything. This may occasionally be a frustrating exercise. It may sometimes feel as if we are peering at the world through a straw or even staring into a funhouse mirror; but the idea is to look at many different scenarios and examine them in a way they have rarely been examined....Steven Levitt may not fully believe in himself, but he does believe in this: teachers and criminals and real-estate agents may lie, and politicians, and even CIA analysts. But numbers don’t.(c)Q:Levitt had an interview for the Society of Fellows, the venerable intellectual clubhouse atHarvard that pays young scholars to do their own work, for three years, with no commitments.Levitt felt he didn’t stand a chance. For starters, he didn’t consider himself an intellectual. He wouldbe interviewed over dinner by the senior fellows, a collection of world-renowned philosophers,scientists, and historians. He worried he wouldn’t have enough conversation to last even the firstcourse.Disquietingly, one of the senior fellows said to Levitt, “I’m having a hard time seeing theunifying theme of your work. Could you explain it?”Levitt was stymied. He had no idea what his unifying theme was, or if he even had one.Amartya Sen, the future Nobel-winning economist, jumped in and neatly summarized what hesaw as Levitt’s theme.Yes, Levitt said eagerly, that’s my theme.Another fellow then offered another theme.You’re right, said Levitt, my theme.And so it went, like dogs tugging at a bone, until the philosopher Robert Nozick interrupted.“How old are you, Steve?” he asked.“Twenty-six.”Nozick turned to the other fellows: “He’s twenty-six years old. Why does he need to have aunifying theme? Maybe he’s going to be one of those people who’s so talented he doesn’t need one.He’ll take a question and he’ll just answer it, and it’ll be fine.”(c)Q:There are three basic flavors of incentive: economic, social, and moral. Very often a single incentive scheme will include all three varieties. Think about the anti-smoking campaign of recent years. The addition of a $3-per-pack “sin tax” is a strong economic incentive against buying cigarettes. The banning of cigarettes in restaurants and bars is a powerful social incentive. And when the U.S. government asserts that terrorists raise money by selling black-market cigarettes, that acts as a rather jarring moral incentive.Some of the most compelling incentives yet invented have been put in place to deter crime. Considering this fact, it might be worthwhile to take a familiar question—why is there so much crime in modern society?—and stand it on its head: why isn’t there a lot more crime? After all, every one of us regularly passes up opportunities to maim, steal, and defraud. The chance of going to jail—thereby losing your job, your house, and your freedom, all of which are essentially economic penalties—is certainly a strong incentive. But when it comes to crime, people also respond to moral incentives (they don’t want to do something they consider wrong) and social incentives (they don’t want to be seen by others as doing something wrong). For certain types of misbehavior, social incentives are terribly powerful. In an echo of Hester Prynne’s scarlet letter, many American cities now fight prostitution with a “shaming” offensive, posting pictures of convicted johns (and prostitutes) on websites or on local-access television. Which is a more horrifying deterrent: a $500 fine for soliciting a prostitute or the thought of your friends and family ogling you on www.HookersAndJohns.com.(с)Q:Some cheating leaves barely a shadow of evidence. In other cases, the evidence is massive.Consider what happened one spring evening at midnight in 1987: seven million American childrensuddenly disappeared. The worst kidnapping wave in history? Hardly. It was the night of April 15,and the Internal Revenue Service had just changed a rule. Instead of merely listing each dependentchild, tax filers were now required to provide a Social Security number for each child. Suddenly,seven million children—children who had existed only as phantom exemptions on the previousyear’s 1040 forms—vanished, representing about one in ten of all dependent children in the UnitedStates(c)Q:Of all the ideas that Kennedy had thought up—and would think up in the future—to fight bigotry, his Superman campaign was easily the cleverest and probably the most productive. It had the precise effect he hoped: turning the Klan’s secrecy against itself, converting precious knowledgeinto ammunition for mockery. Instead of roping in millions of members as it had just a generationearlier, the Klan lost momentum and began to founder. Although the Klan would never quite die,especially down South—David Duke, a smooth-talking Klan leader from Louisiana, mountedlegitimate bids for the U.S. Senate and other offices—it was also never quite the same. In The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America, the historian Wyn Craig Wade calls Stetson Kennedy “the single most important factor in preventing a postwar revival of the Ku Klux Klan in the North.”This did not happen because Kennedy was courageous or resolute or unflappable, even though he was all of these. It happened because Kennedy understood the raw power of information. The Ku Klux Klan was a group whose power—much like that of politicians or real-estate agents or stockbrokers—was derived in large part from the fact that it hoarded information. Once that information falls into the wrong hands (or, depending on your point of view, the right hands), much of the group’s advantage disappears.(с)Q:Information is so powerful that the assumption of information, even if the information does not actually exist, can have a sobering effect.(c)Q:It is common for one party to a transaction to have better information than another party. Inthe parlance of economists, such a case is known as an information asymmetry. We accept as averity of capitalism that someone (usually an expert) knows more than someone else (usually aconsumer). (c)Q:If you were to assume that many experts use their information to your detriment, you’d beright. Experts depend on the fact that you don’t have the information they do. Or that you are sobefuddled by the complexity of their operation that you wouldn’t know what to do with theinformation if you had it. Or that you are so in awe of their expertise that you wouldn’t darechallenge them. If your doctor suggests that you have angioplasty—even though some currentresearch suggests that angioplasty often does little to prevent heart attacks—you aren’t likely tothink that the doctor is using his informational advantage to make a few thousand dollars forhimself or his buddy. But as David Hillis, an interventional cardiologist at the University of TexasSouthwestern Medical Center in Dallas, explained to the New York Times, a doctor may have thesame economic incentives as a car salesman or a funeral director or a mutual fund manager: “Ifyou’re an invasive cardiologist and Joe Smith, the local internist, is sending you patients, and if youtell them they don’t need the procedure, pretty soon Joe Smith doesn’t send patients anymore.”(c)Q:Consider this true story, related by John Donohue, a law professor who in 2001 was teaching at Stanford University: “I was just about to buy a house on the Stanford campus,” he recalls, “and the seller’s agent kept telling me what a good deal I was getting because the market was about to zoom. As soon as I signed the purchase contract, he asked me if I would need an agent to sell my previous Stanford house. I told him that I would probably try to sell without an agent, and he replied, ‘John, that might work under normal conditions, but with the market tanking now, you really need the help of a broker.’”Within five minutes, a zooming market had tanked. Such are the marvels that can be conjured by an agent in search of the next deal.(c)Q:They were also a lot richer, taller, skinnier, and better-looking than average. That, at least, is what they wrote about themselves. More than 4 percent of the online daters claimed to earn more than $200,000 a year, whereas fewer than 1 percent of typical Internet users actually earn that much, suggesting that three of the four big earners were exaggerating. Male and female users typically reported that they are about an inch taller than the national average. As for weight, the men were in line with the national average, but the women typically said they weighed about twenty pounds less than the national average.Most impressively, fully 70 percent of the women claimed “above average” looks, including 24 percent claiming “very good looks.” The online men too were gorgeous: 67 percent called themselves “above average,” including 21 percent with “very good looks.” This leaves only about 30 percent of the users with “average” looks, including a paltry 1 percent with “less than average” looks—which suggests that the typical online dater is either a fabulist, a narcissist, or simply resistant to the meaning of “average.” (Or perhaps they are all just realists: as any real-estate agent knows, the typical house isn’t “charming” or “fantastic,” but unless you say it is, no one will even bother to take a look.) Twenty-eight percent of the women on the site said they were blond, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dyeing, or lying, or both. Some users, meanwhile, were bracingly honest. Eight percent of the men—about 1 in every 12 conceded that they were married, with half of these 8 percent reporting that they were “happily married.” But the fact that they were honest doesn’t mean they were rash. Of the 258 “happily married” men in the sample, only 9 chose to post a picture of themselves. The reward of gaining a mistress was evidently outweighed by the risk of having your wife discover your personal ad. (c)Q:But if there is no unifying theme to Freakonomics, there is at least a common thread running through the everyday application of Freakonomics. It has to do with thinking sensibly about how people behave in the real world. All it requires is a novel way of looking, of discerning, of measuring. This isn’t necessarily a difficult task, nor does it require supersophisticated thinking. We have essentially tried to figure out what the typical gang member or sumo wrestler figured out on his own (although we had to do so in reverse).Will the ability to think such thoughts improve your life materially? Probably not. Perhaps you’ll put up a sturdy gate around your swimming pool or push your real-estate agent to work a little harder. But the net effect is likely to be more subtle than that. You might become more skeptical of the conventional wisdom; you may begin looking for hints as to how things aren’t quite what they seem; perhaps you will seek out some trove of data and sift through it, balancing your intelligence and your intuition to arrive at a glimmering new idea. Some of these ideas might make you uncomfortable, even unpopular. To claim that legalized abortion resulted in a massive drop in crime will inevitably lead to explosive moral reactions. (c)"

There's not enough discussion on the data itself, no distinction between quantitative and qualitative, and not enough discussion on the many flaws of data and how we analyze it. Pretty interesting how much he dislikes criminologists but then (if I remember correctly), only mentions the same one or two names over and over when giving examples of criminologists that had agendas/tricked the public. Also the fact that the entire book, and the issues, feels very simplified. Actually the author puts it best himself: ""The typical parenting expert, like experts in other fields, is prone to sound exceedingly sure of himself. An expert doesn’t so much argue the various sides of an issue, as plant his flag firmly on one side. That’s because an expert who’s argument reeks of restraint or nuance often doesn’t get much attention. An expert must be bold if he hopes to alchemise (?) his homespun theory into conventional wisdom."" This is often how I perceived the book to be written, very simplified, without enough nuance or room for possible explanations - only one right answer. I didn't like how the book was written, how the topics where dealt with, and had a hard time taking anything seriously after all of the self-admiration and the repeated ""all experts have agendas (except for us)"" talk in every chapter.

Even for someone like me whose general response to economics is *snore*. And it's mainly because Freakonomics is not really about economics, but involves applying statistical analysis to many social issues and questions. Very easy to read. Lots of shocking discoveries that seem weighted in fact - Roe v. Wade is responsible for a huge drop in crime? No wonder some people are pissed off with this book. It's really quite fascinating to look at the power of incentives - economic, social and moral - and examine cause and effect. One of my favourite personal experiences with silly notions of cause and effect is diet soft drinks. I confess to being a bit of a coke zero addict. It's not great for you (the sodium makes you more thirsty, a lot of potassium can lead to palpitations, and a lot of phosphoric acid has been linked to kidney problems) but I've lost count of how many times people have cited statistics showing that diet soda drinkers are more likely to be overweight and diabetic. Of course they are! If you're overweight and diabetic you're more likely to drink the low-calorie, sugar-free alternatives, aren't you? So strange how people assume it is A that causes B and ignore the possibility of it being the opposite.Anyway, my issue with this entertaining book is that I think it may be - to be frank - bullshit. Not all of it, sure. But definitely some of it. The writers state their points very confidently (some might say with a touch too much smarm) but it requires you to take a lot of what they say on faith. And some of the jumps they make between statistics and conclusion don't quite add up for me. I know many others have felt the same.But here was the thing that really got me, the thing that made me smell bullshit: I'm fairly confident something they said is not rooted in any truth. And let's be clear: I am a total noob when it comes to most statistics and economics, so if even I can spot something a bit off, it really makes me question the rest of it. Here it is:
Women's rights advocates, for instance, have hyped the incidence of sexual assault, claiming that one in three American women will in her lifetime be a victim of rape or attempted rape. (The actual figure is more like one in eight - but the advocates know it would take a callous person to publicly dispute their claims.)
This, if true, implies two things. 1) Those advocating women's rights are using false data, therefore undermining their credibility, and 2) They have invented a statistic to intentionally support their cause, knowing no one will dispute it (absolutely bizarre that the author thinks no one is disputing women's rights claims, but okay...)Well, being a feminist and someone who has spent an awful lot of time reading and writing about women's rights organizations and statistics, my eyes narrowed a little. See, in all my research, I've never seen or heard any claim that ""1 in 3 women will be a victim of rape or attempted rape"". I have heard the ""1 in 3"" statistic, but a somewhat different one.So, obviously, I went to look it up. I spent a couple of hours going through Google and every women's rights organization page I could find, trying to uncover a single case where that statistic was used. I found exactly: none. The only other thing I found that mentioned it was a Time article attempting to debunk so-called ""feminist myths"": http://time.com/3222543/5-feminist-my...The statistic the authors appear to have misquoted is that ""1 in 3 women will experience sexual violence, or physical violence by an intimate partner"", which is used often. Sexual violence here is an ambiguous term, leaving room for wider interpretations and probably explaining why, with the addition of domestic violence into the statistic, the number is at ""1 in 3"" instead of ""1 in 8"". Furthermore, not only have the authors misrepresented the statistical claim itself, but they have also suggested that women's rights advocates have pulled the numbers from thin air to make a point - on the contrary, this is a study conducted by the World Health Organization on the ""Global and regional estimates of violence against women"".I like the idea of the book, but this really put me off. Perhaps it was a one-off error that I managed to spot. Perhaps. Either way, I started to be less impressed by the facts and statistics they presented. Still, very enjoyable book for the most part."

Levitt and Dubner explore a diverse range of subjects: from linking Roe v. Wade to violent crime, cheating by teachers and sumo wrestlers to an economic model of drug dealing. I’d like to think that the stories told by the authors and the way they analyze conventional thinking would put me on a path to look past easy answers. Having completed Freakonomics, do I look at the world radically differently than I did before picking up the book? It is Interesting to look at subjects from a different angle. Positing that economics and specifically the field of study now dubbed freakonomics has nothing to do with morality is an intriguing concept as well, but deciding which stories to tell is necessarily selective. Indeed, the focus is interesting. So yes I enjoyed Freakonomics, but feel I should have more to say about it and the authors’ underlying premises than I do. 3.25 stars "

141,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/972904-jake,2,"The Basics:Freakonomics isn’t really about any one thing, which makes it a bit hard to summarize. In essence, it’s economist Steven Levitt playing around with economic principles and basic statistical analysis to examine various cultural trends and phenomena. He tackles a variety of questions, from whether or not sumo wrestlers cheat (they do) to whether or not a child’s name determines his success (it doesn’t). He does this all through examining statistics and data, trying to find facts to back up various assertions rather than relying on conventional wisdom.The Good:As a person who is sick of the inability of most people to have a rational discourse on any even vaguely politicized topic, and a self-proclaimed skeptic, it’s nice to read anyone who endorses looking at hard data to make judgments about possibly controversial issues. Levitt does a nice job of not only proclaiming the advantages of this sort of rational outlook, but also of showing that when you actually examine the data, you sometimes get surprising results. Furthermore, he takes the time to point out that there is a difference between correlation and causation, and that many people mistake one for the other. Again, a nice touch.The actual questions that Levitt asks are all fairly interesting, though some will appeal to certain readers more than others. In addition to cheating sumotori and strange names, Levitt also examines cheating teachers, the economics of crack dealers, and the effect of abortion on crime. Crime, in point of fact, seems to be Levitt’s greatest interest, and I wonder if he might not have been better served by writing an entire book on the relationship between economics and crime, as opposed to trying to touch on a number of different subjects that are all largely unrelated. It might have made for a tighter, more focused book.The writing is solid; simple and easy, but solid. Despite being a book about economics, it’s not a terribly dense read, as witnessed by the fact that I finished it off in about two days. Granted, it was two days of heavy reading, but it was still two days.The Bad:For a book that’s so gung ho about statistics, there aren’t many statistics in here. Levitt claims that the numbers back up his research, but he rarely provides the data itself, which makes it difficult to tell how much he might be manipulating statistics to serve his own ends. It makes the book seem like it’s been dumbed down for the plebian masses, which will be very frustrating to any intelligent reader who wants to look at Levitt’s data themselves. Any reader who doesn’t feel like reading the numbers can do what most of us did in undergrad—skip the numbers sections. It’s just sloppy; I can’t imagine Levitt would do this in a formal economics paper.The book also lacks much in the way of an unifying theme, a problem that is acknowledged within the text itself; that isn’t only sad, it’s sloppy. I doubt that a writer of Dubner’s skill and an economist of Levitt’s apparent genius (more on that below) are totally incapable of thinking of and describing some kind of unifying theme throughout this work. It just smacks of laziness, even more so when there’s a half-hearted “well, I guess you could say it’s this…” sort of thing in the epilogue. Again, I have trouble imagining that Levitt would submit a paper that was this disjointed to a serious economic publication; why should the general public be treated less seriously?The Ugly:The self-aggrandizement. Oh, the self-aggrandizement.Every chapter is preceded by excerpts from an article about Levitt, which all tell us what a brilliant and unconventional economist this man is. In the introduction, we’re told that he really wasn’t that interested in writing a book, unless he got to work with this wonderful journalist who had written an article about him earlier. The cover promises that we will be “dazzled” by a “rogue economist” who explains “the hidden side of everything.”For all of this talk of brilliance and dazzling explanations, the book doesn’t seem that brilliant. It seems like a transcript of some interesting dinner conversation with a smart guy, the sort that makes you go home and think, “hey, this stuff is interesting, I ought to go pick up a book about it.” Of course, the problem here is that you’ve already picked up the book.The fact that Levitt wasn’t that interested in writing a book in the first place is telling; this book feels like something written by a person who needed to get the work done, but really wasn’t engaged in what he was doing. Maybe he should have waited until he was a little more motivated."

This is an awful book, yes I read the whole thing, like bitter medicine to a toddler, and had to see what the fuss was about.This Amazon review nails it.  Here's my review/rant. I'm reading this is 2012, maybe the hype in 2005 was different and people ate this kind of stuff up, even then I don't think we were that gullible at this time. There were good social science/stats books out there. This book pales in comparison to the works of Malcolm Gladwell and others. Levitt is making something out of nothing from strange stories he heard, now he's stitching them together suggesting there's a *GASP* hidden side to everything. Because the KKK spoke in code, real estate listings are supposedly in code, and we're all being duped into spending more for our house because of the secret speak between realtors! How about consumers don't just read a real estate listings but check a place out before making the biggest purchase of their lives, one could argue there's secret speak in every industry. For his final chapter (which is in the middle of the book) Levitt's grand finale, Black people name their children differently to White people! The second half of the book is blog posts from their blog more atrocious reading from these ranting lunatics. There's no appeal to science, Levitt is throwing a lot of his own opinion, and making wild estimations and bringing up even wilder conclusions. It's pretty obvious Levitt is a shrewd businessman, he's not just writing books, but has a well to do following with his blog, radio station and yes even movie!

And I am thus indebted to such an extent, that I can confess to arriving early for any flight departing from an airport with a bookstore for the sole purpose of securing a few additional minutes to browse books. If it were not for the practicalities of travelling, I would probably have bought this book much sooner than I did for I had been securing extra minutes in airport bookstores just to read through another chapter long before I actually bought it.You see, my travels are laden with a heavy debate: shall I pack my extra suitcase with books or groceries? I resolve this by alternating. For one trip to the Outside, a spare duffel bag will be dedicated to books and I will shun all opportunities to visit grocery stores just to preserve that determination. On the next visit, I will carry a spare cooler (rather than duffel bag) and splurge on leg of lamb and cheeses free of artificial coloring. The ultimate effect of this system, however, is a backlog in possessing the books I'd like to read.Finally, however, the fates aligned. I was travelling to Iowa on what I expected to be a gloriously grocery-focused trip. But my cooler broke as I was carrying it to the truck that we would drive to our local airport. There wasn't time to fix it. I was sad, of course, as I had been anticipating all the pork I was going to return with from Iowa. But I consoled myself with all those Iowa cookbooks I could now carry, and resolved not to prolong any lamentations over the cooler. And, oh, did I find myself lugging around a heavy library - such hours did I spend in Powells (there was a 1 week layover in Oregon) and Iowa City's bookstores. The day before we left Iowa, Nate told me about how much he enjoyed this book. His description renewed my interest, and I committed myself to buying a copy before we left. But, alas, we ran out of time. We didn't make it to a bookstore. It was sadder than the last-minute loss of the cooler. So when we arrived in Chicago, and had a few minutes to wait for the connecting flight to Alaska, and our gate was right next to a book kiosk, and I was pretty sure there was just enough room in my carry-on to squeeze in one more book - it was this book that I grabbed. I raced through it. Loving each chapter. I really can't recommend it enough. A fun read, for those who like to be entertained by books. Informative too, for those that like to read for knowledge, thought, and/or discourse. But what elevates it to favorite is that it alters perception and challenges assumptions. For what it's worth, I have no regrets that I carried this book rather than Iowa pork.....and I can think of no finer testament to a good book.

DubnerFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything is the debut non-fiction book by University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and New York Times journalist Stephen J. Dubner. It was published on April 12, 2005, by William Morrow. The book has been described as melding pop culture with economics. By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide. The book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by ""traditional"" economists. In Freakonomics, Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of incentives. The book's chapters cover:Chapter 1: Discovering cheating as applied to teachers and sumo wrestlers, as well as a typical Washington, D.C.–area bagel business and its customersChapter 2: Information control as applied to the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agentsChapter 3: The economics of drug dealing, including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealersChapter 4: The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime, contrasted with the policies and downfall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled ""The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime,"" written with John Donohue.)Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good parenting on educationChapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children (nominative determinism)تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه آگوست سال 2008 میلادیعنوان: اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های پنهان اجتماعی؛ نویسنده: استیون لویت، استپان‌ دابنر؛ مترجم: سعید مشیری؛ تهران: نشر نی‏‫، 1386؛ در 269 ص؛ شابک: 9789643129507؛ چاپ دوم 1392؛ موضوع: اقتصاد از نویسندگان امریکایی - جنبه های روانشناسی - سده 21 معنوان: اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها؛ نویسنده: استیون دی‌. لویت؛ مترجم: امیرحسین توکلی؛ تهران: سبزان‏‫، 1385؛ در 197 ص؛ شابک: 9789648249674؛ عنوان روی جلد: اقتصاد علم انگیزه‌ها: مهارت‌های لازم برای کشف ابعاد پنهان پدیده‌ها؛‬کتاب «فریکونومیکس» در باره ی اقتصاد، از اقتصاددان دانشگاه شیکاگو «استیون لویت» است، که نخستین بار در روز دوازدهم ماه آوریل سال 2005 میلادی منتشر شد. این کتاب تا پایان سال 2009 میلادی، بیش از چهار میلیون نسخه فروش داشته است. کتاب با عنوان «اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های اجتماعی» توسط نشر نی و با ترجمه ی جناب «سعید مشیری»، و با عنوان: «اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها»؛ با ترجمه ی جناب «امیرحسین توکلی»، منتشر شده است. کتاب چندین فصل دارد: درباره حقه زدن در شغل‌هایی مانند معلمی و کشتی‌گیران سومو؛ شباهت‌های کوکلوس‌کلان‌ و افراد معاملات ملکی؛ سیستم اقتصادی کارتل‌های مواد مخدر؛ تاثیر قانونی‌سازی سقط جنین در کاهش جرایم چندین سال بعد؛ نقش بسیار کم تربیت خوب کودکان توسط والدین در بهتر شدن آموزش و پرورششان؛ و الگوهای نامگذاری کودکان در یک جامعه. ا. شربیانی"
157,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249257-elise,3,"Levitt makes the lofty claim that economics is not swayed by moral sensibilities - it's a pure numbers game of course! However, not knowing much about him beyond his affiliation with the University of Chicago and what was written in the book, I can surmise that he is conservative, or at least what today would be inappropriately labeled ""moderate."" Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily...or at least I don't view it that way. Does it affect his conclusions? Absolutely. Levitt assumes his assertion that Roe v. Wade is responsible for the drop in crime experienced in the 1990s is the most controversial in the book, but I was not bothered by that conclusion at all. What did raise my ire a bit was his statement that ""Minorities commit more crimes."" Perhaps the pure numbers seem to show so, but upon closer examination and more careful thought, one might conclude that minorities are simply arrested and convicted more often. In many cases, Levitt does delve into the deeper ""behind the scenes"" reasons for why things happen, but in this glaring example, he delves no further than to admit that poverty might have a link to crime commission, and with more minorities in poverty more of them commit crimes. Might it also have a link to crime conviction? The white suburban kid who can afford a long and arduous defense, or whose father knows someone who can get the kid out of a jam, has a much better chance of having his case dismissed than a poor minority kid assigned a public defender (not to say that public defenders don't do good work - in fact many of them are some of the most amazing lawyers out there). Suffice to say the system is stacked against people in poverty and minorities, and Levitt fails to fully acknowledge this in his discussion of what causes and helps prevent crime. I wasn't so much angry as I was disappointed. When one of the brightest minds in our country can't see beyond his own prejudices, where is the hope for the rest of us? Levitt might be a genius, but he is woefully culturally incompetent. "
158,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/847862-paulius,1,"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (2005)There are intriguing elements in this book but when it comes to the larger picture, I find it sorely lacking. Levitt is a young star in the economics profession who enjoys playing games with interesting questions. For example, he assembles data to demonstrate that Roe v. Wade was critical to the drop in the crime rate in the 90s. On p. 125 he notes ""So it wasn't capital punishment that drove crime down, nor was it the booming economy. But higher rates of imprisonment did have a lot to do with it."" Also, on p. 139, he says ""Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness, unwantedness leads to high crime, legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime."" He also addresses the old nature vs. nurture argument or environment vs. genetics when he says, on pp. 175-176, ""Parents who are well educated, successful, and healthy tend to have children who test well in school, but it doesn't seem to much matter whether a child is trotted off to museums or spanked or sent to Head Start....The reality is that technique looks to be highly overrated....adopted children test relatively poorly in school, any influence the adoptive parents might exert is seemingly outweighed by the force of genetics. But...the parents were not powerless forever. By the time the adopted children bacame adults, they had veered sharply from the destiny that IQ alone might have predicted. Compared to similar children who were not put up for adoption, the adoptees were far more likely to attend college, to have a well-paid job, and to wait until they were out of their teens before getting married."" Despite these insights, I would never want to write a book like this because it doesn't go after the betterment of the human condition in a broad sense in the fashion that Adam Smith tried with Wealth of Nations in 1776. Levitt may be rewarded for his fun puzzles by a best-seller, but does any of this really help society toward healthier, happier families in the future?"
159,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4047121-william-moore,1,"Freakonomics: a rogue economist – Is that all there is?The title of Freakonomics tells us that Steven Levitt is a “rogue economist” exploring the “the hidden side of everything.” I have always been up for a rogue telling me about everything. Even a rogue telling me about anything appeals to me; you know that special insight that only a mischievous, perhaps unprincipled, but somehow likeable person has. From the title I even conjured up some noble rogue elephant tearing apart the civilized world after suffering a loss of habitat. I was up for rogue. Economics, I thought, is a damn good place for a rogue.Levitt is an economics professor at the University of Chicago and a winner of the John Bates Clark Medal. That medal is awarded every two years to the best economist under 40. It is given by the American Economic Association. If you know anything about this Vanderbilt University supported organization, it wouldn’t be for their search for rogues (although they got Milton Friedman right in 1951.)Steven Levitt is best-known for his findings on America’s falling crime-rate during the 1990s. Teenage murder rates were predicted to double. Instead they fell by more than 50% in the space of five years. By 2000 they were at their lowest in 35 years. But why? Well, a lot of people were taking the credit. They were citing economic growth, gun control, policing, imprisonment and even the death penalty as the reason. Levitt proved the cause as Roe vs Wade, the Supreme Court decision that lead to the repeal of abortion laws in the US. His research showed that children born into impoverished environments were more likely to grow up to become criminals. His analysis formed the elegant but uncomfortable syllogism: “Unwantedness leads to high crime; abortion leads to less unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime.”Levitt is saying, according to Dubner, that incentives and motivations are intimately linked in driving human behaviour. No breakthrough – my mum knew that! He does come through with some interesting proofs. His ingenious methods of analysing data reveal sometimes startling conclusions: Chicago public school teachers were helping their students cheat on state exams; Sumo wrestlers were fixing some of their matches; real-estate agents don’t really care about how much they sell your house for – only their own house, and my favourite; dope-dealers rarely make a good living. These results do amuse, surprise and even educate. In all these conclusions there is a haunting. Strangely, within these intriguing anomalies we never find that superbly-skilled rogue practitioner of economics. Instead we are left with a peppy little repertoire of cocktail chatter (beer-chat for me) and little else.Something went wrong in the writing of Freakonomics. In the reading there was the echo of Mark Twain’s comment that golf was “a good walk spoiled.” Yes it is provocative and interesting but it has a problem. If Malcolm Gladwell of Tipping Point fame says “Steven Levitt has the most interesting mind in America . . .” then the problem is uncompromisingly simple – we can’t find Levitt or his mind in this book!Without question we can find – actually, we can’t get away from – the other Stephen, Stephen Dubner. He is Levitt’s coauthor and a contributor to the New York Times. Dubner occasionally genuflects to Levitt’s genius, to his unique insight, and treats us to the odd passing anecdote. For most of the book though he relies on the coattails of Levitt to spin his own story.Dubner just doesn’t get Levitt. A flaw, especially given the hype in the title. He tells us that this very special economist is challenging the established lens through which we see conventional economics. The problem is what is conventional is never argued and the nature of the difference is never revealed. This new lens, we are told, uncovers – no exposes – the patterns of conventional thinking. These come by way of conclusive moments, end points really, that are sometimes remarkably fascinating and clearly capture interest. The question is, are these moments, this shopping-list of results, the only point of the book?Although Steven Levitt is apparently (or even paradoxically) the coauthor, he never actually appears. Not only is he not there but his methodology is never fully presented nor explained. Malcolm Gladwell goes on to say “. . . and reading Freakonomics is like going for a leisurely walk with him on a sunny summer day, as he waves his fingers in the air and turns everything you once thought to be true inside out.” Well the problem is we never get to go on that walk with Steven Levitt. He just might be nearby, but you never know for sure.The book is a first-person telling by Dubner. So it leaves Dubner responsible for that walk. It also leaves him responsible for the non-telling of either process or personality. It is an issue of depth. His preamble, along with the very bad An Explanatory Note are ill-chosen attempts at building an arcane, deified and mystical Steven Levitt. When we get into the book, we think we are going to meet Levitt, this “rogue economist” – but we never do.Dubner continually misses the mark. He let a good book and a great opportunity slip away. This is because he thinks the mark is simply some captivating Levitt conclusion. Even though I found myself relishing some of these points and was more than willing to tell these little tidbits to my friends; they leave forever undone some important thinking.The success of the book is that each story is portable. In their portability there is a weakness. If the point is, each story is an indicator of how we can mis-see the world, then how do we understand mis-seeing or recognise mis-telling? The only way to know would be to understand Levitt, economics, and the processes by which we make conventional and sometimes remarkably wrong conclusions.We never do. Instead, in each story there is an echo of missed opportunity. In each he takes us on some short walk on how we might see the world. The trouble is it is only a short walk with no critical path to understand how we got there or just where we might be going.Dubner tells us early on that when the publisher approached Steven Levitt, Levitt didn’t want to write a book. He finally did agree to write it, but along with Dubner who had done a story about him for the Times. So Dubner and the brilliant Levitt agree to coauthor. Freakonomics is the result of that division of labour. Presumably Levitt’s job was to continue mining of the reality of the “hidden side of everything.” Then what was Stephen Dubner’s job? The answer: The weaver of these disparate stories; the interpreter; the pattern-finder – the writer! Unfortunately a substantive telling never happens. It takes about half the book to slowly realize Dubner doesn’t really get Levitt – and neither do we.In the end this book bizarrely peters off into some kind of parenting manual. This is presumably because Dubner and Levitt are young fathers. Who knows? Dubner then thinks he can put Humpty back together by saying in the Epilogue that there is “no unifying theme” in Freakonomics. Well he got that right! Here he is alluding to a quote by the philosopher Robert Nozick where Nozick said that at 26 Levitt didn’t need a “unifying theme” as an economist. This may be right for a young economist – but it is not necessarily true of a book.Dubner’s patchwork attempt at an ending only exacerbates the reality of missed opportunity. Unfortunately it causes Freakonomics to read a bit like: What my really important really smart friend did on his summer vacation.William Moore"

Something like ""freakostatistics"" would make much more sense as the name of the book.2. in the introduction, the writers warn us that correlation does not imply causality. OK, agreed. But the rest of the book is just that: THEY act as if correlation and causality are the same thing (but they just have more ""fun"" explanation for stuff). What exactly is their proof that they are not ""inventing explanations"" based on correlation, without any real evidence of causation?This book is just a pile of interesting nonsense.EDIT (2016): There is another thing in the authors' arguments that really bother me (besides the ""correlation vs causality"" debate). The authors' approach to economics is that economics is all about how incentives play out. While incentives are no doubt important in human behaviour, this is an extremely shallow way of talking about economics. It is also very consistent with ""unfettered free market"" ideology, which says that the best way to organize society is through profit incentive. This is a dangerous proposition (as we have seen in 2008) and scientifically very doubtful."

The worst part was definitely his sweeping assumptions and conclusions based on his oh-so-reliable data. He thinks he can get away with this because the preface of the book says that he doesn't come to any conclusions--just asking questions, but the writing SUGGESTS conclusions. Just look at the subtitle, ""the Hidden Side of Everything."" He manipulates the reader into thinking there are connections between things by placing the data and a possible explanation on the same page. The problem with those explanations is that there is no scientific approach. Most of his data are purely observational--which is inherently flawed when trying to find cause and effect. I think the book started off wrong when the so-called economist claimed that he didn't like calculus. I'm not sure how you can call yourself an economist without calculus...

165,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17533257-jesse-lehrer,1,"The overarching point of this book is absolutely correct: conventional wisdom and what we perceive to be logical often is not. Our society is wrapped up and smothered in incorrect, dysfunctional assumptions that continue to rule our world and ruin our lives. Bigotry, ignorance, prejudice, fear, and the way people in power use these tools to divide and conquer us is at the root of all of our problems.That being said - everything else in this book is mediocre to bad. The writers make repeated assumptions and statements that are just flat out wrong. They make interesting points, and their comparisons are often thought provoking, but they could have used more of their own medicine.This book is clearly written by economists. Economics is one of the most useless, garbage ideologies ever created by humans. This is, of course, my opinion - but this book, I feel, only serves to prove that opinion. Over and over again the authors try to narrow down causes to one thing or another. They try to find the factor that changed everything. The abortion/crime essay is the clearest - abortion being legal is NOT the only factor that led to crime going down. There are thousands of factors that all contribute to everything that happens. Economists like to boil things down to numbers - instead of looking at people, looking at the complexity of life, they want a simple answer. There are no simple answers.In the book the authors do, occasionally, note that just one thing is not the cause - but they then go back on this again and again by making ridiculous statements, ie:""What sort of woman was most likely to take advantage of Roe v. Wade? Very often she was unmarried or in her teens or poor and sometimes all three."" This sentence gives the image of the typical woman getting an abortion to be a poor teenage girl. They don't say that's the majority, but the implication by choosing this example is that it's the norm. This is absolutely false - Planned Parenthood has plenty of information on this - the most common type of woman who gets an abortion is a woman who has already had a kid(s) and accidentally got pregnant and didn't want another kid. No stereotyping, no images of teenagers making bad choices, etc.Then there's this gem: ""Black Americans were hurt more by crack cocaine than by any other single cause since Jim Crow""I almost stopped reading the book there. That is so wrong, so offensive, so ignorant it is utterly ridiculous. There is NO SINGLE CAUSE of anything! This reductionist economist bullshit is exactly why I hate economics. And if there was a single cause - it wasn't fucking crack. It was racism, or structural racism, or criminalizing of young black people, or economic segregation, or reagonomics, or zoning laws, or re-districting, etc. etc. etc. Crack ruining black communities is, in actuality, a myth. Yes, it's a problem, yes, drug addiction in all forms is terrible, but this myth that crack just fell on black communities like a nuclear bomb leaving nothing behind but violence and death is just plain false. Additionally: the crackdown on drugs came BEFORE crack became an issue - it was a political device pre-dating crack used by Reagan to get votes from ignorant white people who feared black people. There are many books documenting this.In short: there are interesting points in this book, and the overall point is absolutely true. We all fall into believing bullshit that feels like it's obvious but is not. It's up to us individually, and as a society, to always seek the truth. However - the truth is not provided in a 20 page article as a single answer. If only the authors took their own ideas further the book might actually be worth something."

To be honest, I really don't see how this author can be taken seriously. This book should be a farce to anyone who has any degree of skeptical thinking; any degree of respect for logic or empirical thought.Leavitt's conclusions are stretched like a rubber chicken (if not shot like one), his correlations are spurious at best, and his conclusions are no more insightful or incisive as what you would hear at a bull session with your friends, sitting around a bar, after knocking back a half dozen brews.Seriously, i really don't get all the hoopla that this title receives. Leavitt's only real talent seems to be collecting lists from public records sources, and then drawing the most asinine conclusions from them, and then writing them up with an ironic tone, just to sound smart. He seems to have accomplished a feat that would make PT Barnum proud... he thought up the most absurd conclusions, passed them off as expert observations, and then by sheer force of will got people to believe him. (You know the saying, ""the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it."")This tripe reminds of ""Who Moved My Cheese"" which was the biggest sham of a marketing snow job ever perpetrated in print, but was somehow widely hailed by business thinkers as a stroke of genius. This happened mainly because the first batch of readers, who got suckered into seriously reading it, didn't want to admit to everyone else that they got suckered into buying (for about 15 bucks) what amounted to bedtime story that any nanny could have come up with on the spot. So they proceeded to tell everyone they knew that the glorified pamphlet was actually wiser than the combined teachings of Confucious. Freakonomics should spend a whole chapter on that.The only real saving grace I found about the book is that I didn't pay full price for it. Ok, so now you know how I really feel about the book. Seriously, instead of buying this book, go spend your money on blue jeans, you're time will be better spent."

Which is a pity, as what it has to say is terribly interesting and amusing.The stuff at the end about how the name you are born with affects your life is very interesting. Also the idea, that is clearly true, but I'd never thought of it before, that people give their daughters crazier names than their sons.The point of this book is to say that sometimes there are very interesting correlations between things that seem quite disparate. The big one (and I haven't checked, but I assume this one didn't go down terribly well with the religious right in America) was the idea that the drop in violent crime in the US was due to the drop in violent criminals and this was due to there being less people brought up in abject poverty which is due to people being able to have access to abortion and not bringing unwanted children into the world.The comparisons between drug dealers and McDonalds as a corporate structure is now received wisdom - Obama quotes this in his book.Overall this is a great little read and quite fun - but really, I can't think of a single book that was improved by self-congratulation."

They put on a ""freak"" show of data (their term choice) to make a sensation and lull the lay economist into thinking they've learned something.

Maybe I'm stating it a little strongly, but it has been over two years since I read this book and I'm still angry about one of their premises. The authors proposed that crime rates went down due to the increase in abortions some 15 years earlier. Yes, they claim society is better off without the kids whose parents apparently didn't want them ever having a chance to grow up to be the miscreants they'd be destined to become. That may be a correlation but it is a huge stretch to claim it is a cause and effect. (The decreased crime rate is much better explained by Strauss & Howe in  Generations , by the way.)

If pressed, I'd assign this book to a category I'd call ""Books That People Who Love Malcolm Gladwell Might Also Enjoy."" There's no doubt that Steven D. Levitt is an expert number-cruncher, organizer, and researcher. The conclusions with which he attempts to wow the reader, however, are specious, hyperbolic, and generally lame-o-zoid.*Here's an example: The author explains a situation in which a parent will not permit their young child to go over to a friend's house because the child's friend's parents keep a gun in their home. The [first] parent, however, WILL allow their child to visit a DIFFERENT friend's house whose parents do NOT have a gun, but whose family has a swimming pool. The book then goes on to explain the statistics behind how many children die of gun deaths in this country in a given year versus how many children die in swimming pools in this country each year and determines that the [original] parent is not, according to the data, acting reasonably due to the fact that the likelihood of the child dying in a swimming pool far outweighs the likelihood of the child dying from a gun. Now, there's a reason why, when we talk about gun-safety, we don't talk about swimming pools. It's because swimming pools, if you'd believe it, don't have anything to do with gun safety.** In fact, that entire statistic-set, while an interesting mental exercise, is really no help to the parent. The statistic, were I a parent, that I would be interested in learning is something like: Out of all of the situations involving children dying from gun wounds in this country in a given year, how many of those instances took place when the child was visiting a friend's house? I don't know the answer to that, so, I'll just continue to be pleasantly outraged and move on to my next thought.This book, at its root, is arguing that the things we take for granted, like, belief-wise, might not only not be the case, but the actual truth of the matter(s) might be completely and utterly counter-intuitive to what we feel to be right. I think that's a great message and I wish this was simply a thinking-outside-the-box appreciation book. As a matter of fact, that's exactly what the [nearly two page] epilogue is arguing. With that in mind, I whole-heartedly recommend this book's epilogue. If, however, you're actually looking for a book to explain the hidden, counter-intuitive side to everything, like, for RIZZ, I'd recommend ""Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences"" by John Allen Paulos. BONUS THOUGHT: I should make it clear that I feel that the reason that ""Freakonomics"" is famous and ""Innumeracy"" is not famous, despite the fact that Mr. Paulos uses fewer pages to say more things more clearly, has to do with the fact that there is actual mathematics involved in the latter while the former just requires the reader to want to feel as though they're a smart person. FIN*But, some are for defs totes awes!**I certainly understand the value in thinking abstractly about complicated questions as a way to expand one's mind/cognitive-like-sitch; it's the conclusion that I'm attacking here."
178,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18423957-eleni,2,"For a book that so heavily relies on (mostly) untested assumptions, the repeated, passionate references to the distinction between causality and correlation is impressive if not audacious, to say the least. Suffice to say, 
“""As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions"".
 Exactly, Stephen. And that would work extremely well as an inside joke too. Unless you are implying that, in contrast with the usual textbooks, 
Freakonomics
 actually uses science to pose those questions. In which case, and given the absolute lack of evidence, statistics and insight on any methodological tools here, I can’t help wondering: Science? What science? Where? GIVE ME ONE PAGE. The other unfortunate thing here is the 
“Revised and Expanded edition”
 issue, which can generally mean a number of things, but in the case of 
Freakonomics
 in specific, it was, as we know, the result of a huge wave of negative feedback from reviewers due to:a) the fact that the authors massively exaggerated some of their assumptions (because, obviously: when you think you’re using science when you really are not, that’s just bound to happen) and, as if this isn't enough already, the authors’ reliance on some quite noticeable mathematical monstrosities.b) The self-praise:“Hi. I’m Stephen J. Dubner. And I’m co-authoring this book. The other author is Steven D. Levitt and he’s such a genius, radical economist that we’re thinking we’ll stuff 
Freakonomics
 with tons of newspaper clippings on how awesome he is. And that’s gonna be all over the place. Yes! Oh, in case you’re wondering what a too-cool-for-school unconventional genius like Steven D. Levitt is doing writing books instead of just being a weird recluse in permanent scientific euphoria, worry not! He wasn't interested in writing anything, silly ones (as if)! Not unless it was with me, because, in case you haven’t figured it out already, I’m a kickarse, amazing journalist too! So please read us. Please. We’ll make you feel important and scientific”.So apparently they got the message and scrapped most of that out of the book, hence the 
“Revised and Expanded”
 edition.But honestly, when I found all that out, for a moment I thought I needed to double check that I was actually reading the revised thing.I was? Really? REALLY? WHAT WAS THE FIRST VERSION LIKE THEN?And it’s certainly not my fault that Nick Hornby has the answer to nearly everything. I don’t remember which issue of The Believer he wrote that in, but it was along the lines of: 
""Freakonomics
 was a cool book and it made me feel smart. But what was it about?”Exactly, thank you.Two stars, because some of the questions they pose have interesting political and social implications, even though all questions are always posed through prose (with the use of loose logic at best) and absolutely not through the use of science.Oh.

It's been on my to-read list for a long time, and after finally got around to reading it, I came away disappointed. The book is mostly a disjointed series of unexpected pairings phrased as questions, like ""What do sumo wrestlers and real estate agents have in common?"" Most of the questions would never be anything an average person would ask or wonder about. The book was a haphazard compilation of these pairings and odd questions but, to be fair, the authors explicitly state that from the get-go. I found the sections on parenting and naming babies to be the most interesting, with the rest of it being on the dull side. Many of these questions felt artificially contrived to create a ""freaky"" spin on economics but it felt forced. That was my chief issue with the book - it felt like it was trying to hard to be edgy and hip, like a geeky kid who tries to impress by looking cool and winds up falling flat.I found Dan Arielly's book, Predictably Irrational to be much more entertaining with a smoother flow. Arielly's book deals with behavioral economics and delves into the reasons why people make the choices they do, some of which seem rational but aren't and others which seem irrational but aren't. Arielly's book left me with a greater insight into my own choices and the mechanisms at work behind them. Freakonomics left me with a general thought of ""Hmm, seemingly unrelated stuff is actually related and vice versa."" For anyone interested in behavior economics presented in a very accessible and entertaining manner, I would recommend Arielly's book over Freakonomics, hands down."

If it were not for the practicalities of travelling, I would probably have bought this book much sooner than I did for I had been securing extra minutes in airport bookstores just to read through another chapter long before I actually bought it.You see, my travels are laden with a heavy debate: shall I pack my extra suitcase with books or groceries? I resolve this by alternating. For one trip to the Outside, a spare duffel bag will be dedicated to books and I will shun all opportunities to visit grocery stores just to preserve that determination. On the next visit, I will carry a spare cooler (rather than duffel bag) and splurge on leg of lamb and cheeses free of artificial coloring.

There wasn't time to fix it. I was sad, of course, as I had been anticipating all the pork I was going to return with from Iowa. But I consoled myself with all those Iowa cookbooks I could now carry, and resolved not to prolong any lamentations over the cooler.

The day before we left Iowa, Nate told me about how much he enjoyed this book. His description renewed my interest, and I committed myself to buying a copy before we left. But, alas, we ran out of time. We didn't make it to a bookstore. It was sadder than the last-minute loss of the cooler. So when we arrived in Chicago, and had a few minutes to wait for the connecting flight to Alaska, and our gate was right next to a book kiosk, and I was pretty sure there was just enough room in my carry-on to squeeze in one more book - it was this book that I grabbed. I raced through it. Loving each chapter. I really can't recommend it enough. A fun read, for those who like to be entertained by books. Informative too, for those that like to read for knowledge, thought, and/or discourse. But what elevates it to favorite is that it alters perception and challenges assumptions.

DubnerFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything is the debut non-fiction book by University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and New York Times journalist Stephen J. Dubner. It was published on April 12, 2005, by William Morrow. The book has been described as melding pop culture with economics. By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide. The book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by ""traditional"" economists. In Freakonomics, Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of incentives. The book's chapters cover:Chapter 1: Discovering cheating as applied to teachers and sumo wrestlers, as well as a typical Washington, D.C.–area bagel business and its customersChapter 2: Information control as applied to the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agentsChapter 3: The economics of drug dealing, including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealersChapter 4: The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime, contrasted with the policies and downfall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled ""The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime,"" written with John Donohue.)Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good parenting on educationChapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children (nominative determinism)تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه آگوست سال 2008 میلادیعنوان: اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های پنهان اجتماعی؛ نویسنده: استیون لویت، استپان‌ دابنر؛ مترجم: سعید مشیری؛ تهران: نشر نی‏‫، 1386؛ در 269 ص؛ شابک: 9789643129507؛ چاپ دوم 1392؛ موضوع: اقتصاد از نویسندگان امریکایی - جنبه های روانشناسی - سده 21 معنوان: اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها؛ نویسنده: استیون دی‌. لویت؛ مترجم: امیرحسین توکلی؛ تهران: سبزان‏‫، 1385؛ در 197 ص؛ شابک: 9789648249674؛ عنوان روی جلد: اقتصاد علم انگیزه‌ها: مهارت‌های لازم برای کشف ابعاد پنهان پدیده‌ها؛‬کتاب «فریکونومیکس» در باره ی اقتصاد، از اقتصاددان دانشگاه شیکاگو «استیون لویت» است، که نخستین بار در روز دوازدهم ماه آوریل سال 2005 میلادی منتشر شد. این کتاب تا پایان سال 2009 میلادی، بیش از چهار میلیون نسخه فروش داشته است. کتاب با عنوان «اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های اجتماعی» توسط نشر نی و با ترجمه ی جناب «سعید مشیری»، و با عنوان: «اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها»؛ با ترجمه ی جناب «امیرحسین توکلی»، منتشر شده است. کتاب چندین فصل دارد: درباره حقه زدن در شغل‌هایی مانند معلمی و کشتی‌گیران سومو؛ شباهت‌های کوکلوس‌کلان‌ و افراد معاملات ملکی؛ سیستم اقتصادی کارتل‌های مواد مخدر؛ تاثیر قانونی‌سازی سقط جنین در کاهش جرایم چندین سال بعد؛ نقش بسیار کم تربیت خوب کودکان توسط والدین در بهتر شدن آموزش و پرورششان؛ و الگوهای نامگذاری کودکان در یک جامعه. ا. شربیانی"
187,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249257-elise,3,"Levitt makes the lofty claim that economics is not swayed by moral sensibilities - it's a pure numbers game of course! However, not knowing much about him beyond his affiliation with the University of Chicago and what was written in the book, I can surmise that he is conservative, or at least what today would be inappropriately labeled ""moderate."" Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily...or at least I don't view it that way. Does it affect his conclusions? Absolutely. Levitt assumes his assertion that Roe v. Wade is responsible for the drop in crime experienced in the 1990s is the most controversial in the book, but I was not bothered by that conclusion at all. What did raise my ire a bit was his statement that ""Minorities commit more crimes."" Perhaps the pure numbers seem to show so, but upon closer examination and more careful thought, one might conclude that minorities are simply arrested and convicted more often. In many cases, Levitt does delve into the deeper ""behind the scenes"" reasons for why things happen, but in this glaring example, he delves no further than to admit that poverty might have a link to crime commission, and with more minorities in poverty more of them commit crimes. Might it also have a link to crime conviction? The white suburban kid who can afford a long and arduous defense, or whose father knows someone who can get the kid out of a jam, has a much better chance of having his case dismissed than a poor minority kid assigned a public defender (not to say that public defenders don't do good work - in fact many of them are some of the most amazing lawyers out there). Suffice to say the system is stacked against people in poverty and minorities, and Levitt fails to fully acknowledge this in his discussion of what causes and helps prevent crime. I wasn't so much angry as I was disappointed. When one of the brightest minds in our country can't see beyond his own prejudices, where is the hope for the rest of us? Levitt might be a genius, but he is woefully culturally incompetent. "
188,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/847862-paulius,1,"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (2005)There are intriguing elements in this book but when it comes to the larger picture, I find it sorely lacking. Levitt is a young star in the economics profession who enjoys playing games with interesting questions. For example, he assembles data to demonstrate that Roe v. Wade was critical to the drop in the crime rate in the 90s. On p. 125 he notes ""So it wasn't capital punishment that drove crime down, nor was it the booming economy. But higher rates of imprisonment did have a lot to do with it."" Also, on p. 139, he says ""Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness, unwantedness leads to high crime, legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime."" He also addresses the old nature vs. nurture argument or environment vs. genetics when he says, on pp. 175-176, ""Parents who are well educated, successful, and healthy tend to have children who test well in school, but it doesn't seem to much matter whether a child is trotted off to museums or spanked or sent to Head Start....The reality is that technique looks to be highly overrated....adopted children test relatively poorly in school, any influence the adoptive parents might exert is seemingly outweighed by the force of genetics. But...the parents were not powerless forever. By the time the adopted children bacame adults, they had veered sharply from the destiny that IQ alone might have predicted. Compared to similar children who were not put up for adoption, the adoptees were far more likely to attend college, to have a well-paid job, and to wait until they were out of their teens before getting married."" Despite these insights, I would never want to write a book like this because it doesn't go after the betterment of the human condition in a broad sense in the fashion that Adam Smith tried with Wealth of Nations in 1776. Levitt may be rewarded for his fun puzzles by a best-seller, but does any of this really help society toward healthier, happier families in the future?"
189,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4047121-william-moore,1,"Freakonomics: a rogue economist – Is that all there is?The title of Freakonomics tells us that Steven Levitt is a “rogue economist” exploring the “the hidden side of everything.” I have always been up for a rogue telling me about everything. Even a rogue telling me about anything appeals to me; you know that special insight that only a mischievous, perhaps unprincipled, but somehow likeable person has. From the title I even conjured up some noble rogue elephant tearing apart the civilized world after suffering a loss of habitat. I was up for rogue. Economics, I thought, is a damn good place for a rogue.Levitt is an economics professor at the University of Chicago and a winner of the John Bates Clark Medal. That medal is awarded every two years to the best economist under 40. It is given by the American Economic Association. If you know anything about this Vanderbilt University supported organization, it wouldn’t be for their search for rogues (although they got Milton Friedman right in 1951.)Steven Levitt is best-known for his findings on America’s falling crime-rate during the 1990s. Teenage murder rates were predicted to double. Instead they fell by more than 50% in the space of five years. By 2000 they were at their lowest in 35 years. But why? Well, a lot of people were taking the credit. They were citing economic growth, gun control, policing, imprisonment and even the death penalty as the reason. Levitt proved the cause as Roe vs Wade, the Supreme Court decision that lead to the repeal of abortion laws in the US. His research showed that children born into impoverished environments were more likely to grow up to become criminals. His analysis formed the elegant but uncomfortable syllogism: “Unwantedness leads to high crime; abortion leads to less unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime.”Levitt is saying, according to Dubner, that incentives and motivations are intimately linked in driving human behaviour. No breakthrough – my mum knew that! He does come through with some interesting proofs. His ingenious methods of analysing data reveal sometimes startling conclusions: Chicago public school teachers were helping their students cheat on state exams; Sumo wrestlers were fixing some of their matches; real-estate agents don’t really care about how much they sell your house for – only their own house, and my favourite; dope-dealers rarely make a good living. These results do amuse, surprise and even educate. In all these conclusions there is a haunting. Strangely, within these intriguing anomalies we never find that superbly-skilled rogue practitioner of economics. Instead we are left with a peppy little repertoire of cocktail chatter (beer-chat for me) and little else.Something went wrong in the writing of Freakonomics. In the reading there was the echo of Mark Twain’s comment that golf was “a good walk spoiled.” Yes it is provocative and interesting but it has a problem. If Malcolm Gladwell of Tipping Point fame says “Steven Levitt has the most interesting mind in America . . .” then the problem is uncompromisingly simple – we can’t find Levitt or his mind in this book!Without question we can find – actually, we can’t get away from – the other Stephen, Stephen Dubner. He is Levitt’s coauthor and a contributor to the New York Times. Dubner occasionally genuflects to Levitt’s genius, to his unique insight, and treats us to the odd passing anecdote. For most of the book though he relies on the coattails of Levitt to spin his own story.Dubner just doesn’t get Levitt. A flaw, especially given the hype in the title. He tells us that this very special economist is challenging the established lens through which we see conventional economics. The problem is what is conventional is never argued and the nature of the difference is never revealed. This new lens, we are told, uncovers – no exposes – the patterns of conventional thinking. These come by way of conclusive moments, end points really, that are sometimes remarkably fascinating and clearly capture interest. The question is, are these moments, this shopping-list of results, the only point of the book?Although Steven Levitt is apparently (or even paradoxically) the coauthor, he never actually appears. Not only is he not there but his methodology is never fully presented nor explained. Malcolm Gladwell goes on to say “. . . and reading Freakonomics is like going for a leisurely walk with him on a sunny summer day, as he waves his fingers in the air and turns everything you once thought to be true inside out.” Well the problem is we never get to go on that walk with Steven Levitt. He just might be nearby, but you never know for sure.The book is a first-person telling by Dubner. So it leaves Dubner responsible for that walk. It also leaves him responsible for the non-telling of either process or personality. It is an issue of depth. His preamble, along with the very bad An Explanatory Note are ill-chosen attempts at building an arcane, deified and mystical Steven Levitt. When we get into the book, we think we are going to meet Levitt, this “rogue economist” – but we never do.Dubner continually misses the mark. He let a good book and a great opportunity slip away. This is because he thinks the mark is simply some captivating Levitt conclusion. Even though I found myself relishing some of these points and was more than willing to tell these little tidbits to my friends; they leave forever undone some important thinking.The success of the book is that each story is portable. In their portability there is a weakness. If the point is, each story is an indicator of how we can mis-see the world, then how do we understand mis-seeing or recognise mis-telling? The only way to know would be to understand Levitt, economics, and the processes by which we make conventional and sometimes remarkably wrong conclusions.We never do. Instead, in each story there is an echo of missed opportunity. In each he takes us on some short walk on how we might see the world. The trouble is it is only a short walk with no critical path to understand how we got there or just where we might be going.Dubner tells us early on that when the publisher approached Steven Levitt, Levitt didn’t want to write a book. He finally did agree to write it, but along with Dubner who had done a story about him for the Times. So Dubner and the brilliant Levitt agree to coauthor. Freakonomics is the result of that division of labour. Presumably Levitt’s job was to continue mining of the reality of the “hidden side of everything.” Then what was Stephen Dubner’s job? The answer: The weaver of these disparate stories; the interpreter; the pattern-finder – the writer! Unfortunately a substantive telling never happens. It takes about half the book to slowly realize Dubner doesn’t really get Levitt – and neither do we.In the end this book bizarrely peters off into some kind of parenting manual. This is presumably because Dubner and Levitt are young fathers. Who knows? Dubner then thinks he can put Humpty back together by saying in the Epilogue that there is “no unifying theme” in Freakonomics. Well he got that right! Here he is alluding to a quote by the philosopher Robert Nozick where Nozick said that at 26 Levitt didn’t need a “unifying theme” as an economist. This may be right for a young economist – but it is not necessarily true of a book.Dubner’s patchwork attempt at an ending only exacerbates the reality of missed opportunity. Unfortunately it causes Freakonomics to read a bit like: What my really important really smart friend did on his summer vacation.William Moore"

Something like ""freakostatistics"" would make much more sense as the name of the book.2. in the introduction, the writers warn us that correlation does not imply causality. OK, agreed. But the rest of the book is just that: THEY act as if correlation and causality are the same thing (but they just have more ""fun"" explanation for stuff). What exactly is their proof that they are not ""inventing explanations"" based on correlation, without any real evidence of causation?This book is just a pile of interesting nonsense.EDIT (2016): There is another thing in the authors' arguments that really bother me (besides the ""correlation vs causality"" debate). The authors' approach to economics is that economics is all about how incentives play out. While incentives are no doubt important in human behaviour, this is an extremely shallow way of talking about economics. It is also very consistent with ""unfettered free market"" ideology, which says that the best way to organize society is through profit incentive. This is a dangerous proposition (as we have seen in 2008) and scientifically very doubtful."

The worst part was definitely his sweeping assumptions and conclusions based on his oh-so-reliable data. He thinks he can get away with this because the preface of the book says that he doesn't come to any conclusions--just asking questions, but the writing SUGGESTS conclusions. Just look at the subtitle, ""the Hidden Side of Everything."" He manipulates the reader into thinking there are connections between things by placing the data and a possible explanation on the same page. The problem with those explanations is that there is no scientific approach. Most of his data are purely observational--which is inherently flawed when trying to find cause and effect. I think the book started off wrong when the so-called economist claimed that he didn't like calculus. I'm not sure how you can call yourself an economist without calculus... Maybe you can't... and maybe that's why this book doesn't work."

In true Chicago School style he pits unbridled laissez-faire at all and sundry in his whimsical little fashion. What we get is a truly melon-scratching mixture of sleight-of-hand and pop economics that revels in its eccentricity while being simultaneously superficial and misleading. Avoid. Avoid if you possibly can."
195,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17533257-jesse-lehrer,1,"The overarching point of this book is absolutely correct: conventional wisdom and what we perceive to be logical often is not. Our society is wrapped up and smothered in incorrect, dysfunctional assumptions that continue to rule our world and ruin our lives. Bigotry, ignorance, prejudice, fear, and the way people in power use these tools to divide and conquer us is at the root of all of our problems.That being said - everything else in this book is mediocre to bad. The writers make repeated assumptions and statements that are just flat out wrong. They make interesting points, and their comparisons are often thought provoking, but they could have used more of their own medicine.This book is clearly written by economists. Economics is one of the most useless, garbage ideologies ever created by humans. This is, of course, my opinion - but this book, I feel, only serves to prove that opinion. Over and over again the authors try to narrow down causes to one thing or another. They try to find the factor that changed everything. The abortion/crime essay is the clearest - abortion being legal is NOT the only factor that led to crime going down. There are thousands of factors that all contribute to everything that happens. Economists like to boil things down to numbers - instead of looking at people, looking at the complexity of life, they want a simple answer. There are no simple answers.In the book the authors do, occasionally, note that just one thing is not the cause - but they then go back on this again and again by making ridiculous statements, ie:""What sort of woman was most likely to take advantage of Roe v. Wade? Very often she was unmarried or in her teens or poor and sometimes all three."" This sentence gives the image of the typical woman getting an abortion to be a poor teenage girl. They don't say that's the majority, but the implication by choosing this example is that it's the norm. This is absolutely false - Planned Parenthood has plenty of information on this - the most common type of woman who gets an abortion is a woman who has already had a kid(s) and accidentally got pregnant and didn't want another kid. No stereotyping, no images of teenagers making bad choices, etc.Then there's this gem: ""Black Americans were hurt more by crack cocaine than by any other single cause since Jim Crow""I almost stopped reading the book there. That is so wrong, so offensive, so ignorant it is utterly ridiculous. There is NO SINGLE CAUSE of anything! This reductionist economist bullshit is exactly why I hate economics. And if there was a single cause - it wasn't fucking crack. It was racism, or structural racism, or criminalizing of young black people, or economic segregation, or reagonomics, or zoning laws, or re-districting, etc. etc. etc. Crack ruining black communities is, in actuality, a myth. Yes, it's a problem, yes, drug addiction in all forms is terrible, but this myth that crack just fell on black communities like a nuclear bomb leaving nothing behind but violence and death is just plain false. Additionally: the crackdown on drugs came BEFORE crack became an issue - it was a political device pre-dating crack used by Reagan to get votes from ignorant white people who feared black people. There are many books documenting this.In short: there are interesting points in this book, and the overall point is absolutely true. We all fall into believing bullshit that feels like it's obvious but is not. It's up to us individually, and as a society, to always seek the truth. However - the truth is not provided in a 20 page article as a single answer. If only the authors took their own ideas further the book might actually be worth something."
196,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830884-tony-viardo,1,"I was actually quite enthusiastic about reading this book, after having heard all the hype about it, and about Levitt.After I read it, however, I was greatly disappointed.This book is so overrated it's not just funny, it's baffling. To be honest, I really don't see how this author can be taken seriously. This book should be a farce to anyone who has any degree of skeptical thinking; any degree of respect for logic or empirical thought.Leavitt's conclusions are stretched like a rubber chicken (if not shot like one), his correlations are spurious at best, and his conclusions are no more insightful or incisive as what you would hear at a bull session with your friends, sitting around a bar, after knocking back a half dozen brews.Seriously, i really don't get all the hoopla that this title receives. Leavitt's only real talent seems to be collecting lists from public records sources, and then drawing the most asinine conclusions from them, and then writing them up with an ironic tone, just to sound smart. He seems to have accomplished a feat that would make PT Barnum proud... he thought up the most absurd conclusions, passed them off as expert observations, and then by sheer force of will got people to believe him. (You know the saying, ""the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it."")This tripe reminds of ""Who Moved My Cheese"" which was the biggest sham of a marketing snow job ever perpetrated in print, but was somehow widely hailed by business thinkers as a stroke of genius. This happened mainly because the first batch of readers, who got suckered into seriously reading it, didn't want to admit to everyone else that they got suckered into buying (for about 15 bucks) what amounted to bedtime story that any nanny could have come up with on the spot. So they proceeded to tell everyone they knew that the glorified pamphlet was actually wiser than the combined teachings of Confucious. Freakonomics should spend a whole chapter on that.The only real saving grace I found about the book is that I didn't pay full price for it. Ok, so now you know how I really feel about the book.

Also the idea, that is clearly true, but I'd never thought of it before, that people give their daughters crazier names than their sons.The point of this book is to say that sometimes there are very interesting correlations between things that seem quite disparate. The big one (and I haven't checked, but I assume this one didn't go down terribly well with the religious right in America) was the idea that the drop in violent crime in the US was due to the drop in violent criminals and this was due to there being less people brought up in abject poverty which is due to people being able to have access to abortion and not bringing unwanted children into the world.The comparisons between drug dealers and McDonalds as a corporate structure is now received wisdom - Obama quotes this in his book.Overall this is a great little read and quite fun - but really, I can't think of a single book that was improved by self-congratulation."

The authors proposed that crime rates went down due to the increase in abortions some 15 years earlier. Yes, they claim society is better off without the kids whose parents apparently didn't want them ever having a chance to grow up to be the miscreants they'd be destined to become. That may be a correlation but it is a huge stretch to claim it is a cause and effect. (The decreased crime rate is much better explained by Strauss & Howe in  Generations , by the way.)

If pressed, I'd assign this book to a category I'd call ""Books That People Who Love Malcolm Gladwell Might Also Enjoy."" There's no doubt that Steven D. Levitt is an expert number-cruncher, organizer, and researcher. The conclusions with which he attempts to wow the reader, however, are specious, hyperbolic, and generally lame-o-zoid.*Here's an example: The author explains a situation in which a parent will not permit their young child to go over to a friend's house because the child's friend's parents keep a gun in their home. The [first] parent, however, WILL allow their child to visit a DIFFERENT friend's house whose parents do NOT have a gun, but whose family has a swimming pool. The book then goes on to explain the statistics behind how many children die of gun deaths in this country in a given year versus how many children die in swimming pools in this country each year and determines that the [original] parent is not, according to the data, acting reasonably due to the fact that the likelihood of the child dying in a swimming pool far outweighs the likelihood of the child dying from a gun. Now, there's a reason why, when we talk about gun-safety, we don't talk about swimming pools. It's because swimming pools, if you'd believe it, don't have anything to do with gun safety.** In fact, that entire statistic-set, while an interesting mental exercise, is really no help to the parent. The statistic, were I a parent, that I would be interested in learning is something like: Out of all of the situations involving children dying from gun wounds in this country in a given year, how many of those instances took place when the child was visiting a friend's house? I don't know the answer to that, so, I'll just continue to be pleasantly outraged and move on to my next thought.This book, at its root, is arguing that the things we take for granted, like, belief-wise, might not only not be the case, but the actual truth of the matter(s) might be completely and utterly counter-intuitive to what we feel to be right. I think that's a great message and I wish this was simply a thinking-outside-the-box appreciation book. As a matter of fact, that's exactly what the [nearly two page] epilogue is arguing. With that in mind, I whole-heartedly recommend this book's epilogue. If, however, you're actually looking for a book to explain the hidden, counter-intuitive side to everything, like, for RIZZ, I'd recommend ""Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences"" by John Allen Paulos. BONUS THOUGHT: I should make it clear that I feel that the reason that ""Freakonomics"" is famous and ""Innumeracy"" is not famous, despite the fact that Mr. Paulos uses fewer pages to say more things more clearly, has to do with the fact that there is actual mathematics involved in the latter while the former just requires the reader to want to feel as though they're a smart person. FIN*But, some are for defs totes awes!**I certainly understand the value in thinking abstractly about complicated questions as a way to expand one's mind/cognitive-like-sitch; it's the conclusion that I'm attacking here."

 Exactly, Stephen. And that would work extremely well as an inside joke too. Unless you are implying that, in contrast with the usual textbooks, 
Freakonomics
 actually uses science to pose those questions. In which case, and given the absolute lack of evidence, statistics and insight on any methodological tools here, I can’t help wondering: Science? What science? Where? GIVE ME ONE PAGE. The other unfortunate thing here is the 
“Revised and Expanded edition”
 issue, which can generally mean a number of things, but in the case of 
Freakonomics
 in specific, it was, as we know, the result of a huge wave of negative feedback from reviewers due to:a) the fact that the authors massively exaggerated some of their assumptions (because, obviously: when you think you’re using science when you really are not, that’s just bound to happen) and, as if this isn't enough already, the authors’ reliance on some quite noticeable mathematical monstrosities.b) The self-praise:“Hi. I’m Stephen J. Dubner. And I’m co-authoring this book. The other author is Steven D. Levitt and he’s such a genius, radical economist that we’re thinking we’ll stuff 
Freakonomics
 with tons of newspaper clippings on how awesome he is. And that’s gonna be all over the place. Yes! Oh, in case you’re wondering what a too-cool-for-school unconventional genius like Steven D. Levitt is doing writing books instead of just being a weird recluse in permanent scientific euphoria, worry not! He wasn't interested in writing anything, silly ones (as if)! Not unless it was with me, because, in case you haven’t figured it out already, I’m a kickarse, amazing journalist too! So please read us. Please. We’ll make you feel important and scientific”.So apparently they got the message and scrapped most of that out of the book, hence the 
“Revised and Expanded”
 edition.But honestly, when I found all that out, for a moment I thought I needed to double check that I was actually reading the revised thing.I was? Really? REALLY?

I don’t remember which issue of The Believer he wrote that in, but it was along the lines of:

But what was it about?”Exactly, thank you.Two stars, because some of the questions they pose have interesting political and social implications, even though all questions are always posed through prose (with the use of loose logic at best) and absolutely not through the use of science.Oh.

It's been on my to-read list for a long time, and after finally got around to reading it, I came away disappointed. The book is mostly a disjointed series of unexpected pairings phrased as questions, like ""What do sumo wrestlers and real estate agents have in common?"" Most of the questions would never be anything an average person would ask or wonder about. The book was a haphazard compilation of these pairings and odd questions but, to be fair, the authors explicitly state that from the get-go. I found the sections on parenting and naming babies to be the most interesting, with the rest of it being on the dull side. Many of these questions felt artificially contrived to create a ""freaky"" spin on economics but it felt forced. That was my chief issue with the book - it felt like it was trying to hard to be edgy and hip, like a geeky kid who tries to impress by looking cool and winds up falling flat.I found Dan Arielly's book, Predictably Irrational to be much more entertaining with a smoother flow. Arielly's book deals with behavioral economics and delves into the reasons why people make the choices they do, some of which seem rational but aren't and others which seem irrational but aren't. Arielly's book left me with a greater insight into my own choices and the mechanisms at work behind them. Freakonomics left me with a general thought of ""Hmm, seemingly unrelated stuff is actually related and vice versa."" For anyone interested in behavior economics presented in a very accessible and entertaining manner, I would recommend Arielly's book over Freakonomics, hands down."

It's as if he just wrote out his thoughts as they were coming to him with no clear outline. I am very much in favor of people who get to the point, and there seems to be no point. Not only that, but he goes about making these correlations using his own data and methods of thinking. The idea that you have to look at unrelated factors to determine actual causes is great, but what about other causes he isn't presenting? The author is in fact doing exactly what he's aiming to expose, but people are so wowed by it because it's presented in an unusual way...

And I am thus indebted to such an extent, that I can confess to arriving early for any flight departing from an airport with a bookstore for the sole purpose of securing a few additional minutes to browse books. If it were not for the practicalities of travelling, I would probably have bought this book much sooner than I did for I had been securing extra minutes in airport bookstores just to read through another chapter long before I actually bought it.You see, my travels are laden with a heavy debate: shall I pack my extra suitcase with books or groceries? I resolve this by alternating. For one trip to the Outside, a spare duffel bag will be dedicated to books and I will shun all opportunities to visit grocery stores just to preserve that determination. On the next visit, I will carry a spare cooler (rather than duffel bag) and splurge on leg of lamb and cheeses free of artificial coloring. The ultimate effect of this system, however, is a backlog in possessing the books I'd like to read.Finally, however, the fates aligned. I was travelling to Iowa on what I expected to be a gloriously grocery-focused trip. But my cooler broke as I was carrying it to the truck that we would drive to our local airport. There wasn't time to fix it. I was sad, of course, as I had been anticipating all the pork I was going to return with from Iowa. But I consoled myself with all those Iowa cookbooks I could now carry, and resolved not to prolong any lamentations over the cooler. And, oh, did I find myself lugging around a heavy library - such hours did I spend in Powells (there was a 1 week layover in Oregon) and Iowa City's bookstores. The day before we left Iowa, Nate told me about how much he enjoyed this book. His description renewed my interest, and I committed myself to buying a copy before we left. But, alas, we ran out of time. We didn't make it to a bookstore. It was sadder than the last-minute loss of the cooler. So when we arrived in Chicago, and had a few minutes to wait for the connecting flight to Alaska, and our gate was right next to a book kiosk, and I was pretty sure there was just enough room in my carry-on to squeeze in one more book - it was this book that I grabbed. I raced through it. Loving each chapter. I really can't recommend it enough. A fun read, for those who like to be entertained by books. Informative too, for those that like to read for knowledge, thought, and/or discourse. But what elevates it to favorite is that it alters perception and challenges assumptions. For what it's worth, I have no regrets that I carried this book rather than Iowa pork.....and I can think of no finer testament to a good book. Then again, most of my entertainment these days revolves around pickling turnips. So if turnips aren't your thing, feel free to take my recommendation with a grain of salt....but you should still read this book."

DubnerFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything is the debut non-fiction book by University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and New York Times journalist Stephen J. Dubner. It was published on April 12, 2005, by William Morrow. The book has been described as melding pop culture with economics. By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide. The book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by ""traditional"" economists. In Freakonomics, Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of incentives. The book's chapters cover:Chapter 1: Discovering cheating as applied to teachers and sumo wrestlers, as well as a typical Washington, D.C.–area bagel business and its customersChapter 2: Information control as applied to the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agentsChapter 3: The economics of drug dealing, including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealersChapter 4: The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime, contrasted with the policies and downfall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled ""The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime,"" written with John Donohue.)Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good parenting on educationChapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children (nominative determinism)تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه آگوست سال 2008 میلادیعنوان: اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های پنهان اجتماعی؛ نویسنده: استیون لویت، استپان‌ دابنر؛ مترجم: سعید مشیری؛ تهران: نشر نی‏‫، 1386؛ در 269 ص؛ شابک: 9789643129507؛ چاپ دوم 1392؛ موضوع: اقتصاد از نویسندگان امریکایی - جنبه های روانشناسی - سده 21 معنوان: اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها؛ نویسنده: استیون دی‌. لویت؛ مترجم: امیرحسین توکلی؛ تهران: سبزان‏‫، 1385؛ در 197 ص؛ شابک: 9789648249674؛ عنوان روی جلد: اقتصاد علم انگیزه‌ها: مهارت‌های لازم برای کشف ابعاد پنهان پدیده‌ها؛‬کتاب «فریکونومیکس» در باره ی اقتصاد، از اقتصاددان دانشگاه شیکاگو «استیون لویت» است، که نخستین بار در روز دوازدهم ماه آوریل سال 2005 میلادی منتشر شد. این کتاب تا پایان سال 2009 میلادی، بیش از چهار میلیون نسخه فروش داشته است. کتاب با عنوان «اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های اجتماعی» توسط نشر نی و با ترجمه ی جناب «سعید مشیری»، و با عنوان: «اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها»؛ با ترجمه ی جناب «امیرحسین توکلی»، منتشر شده است. کتاب چندین فصل دارد: درباره حقه زدن در شغل‌هایی مانند معلمی و کشتی‌گیران سومو؛ شباهت‌های کوکلوس‌کلان‌ و افراد معاملات ملکی؛ سیستم اقتصادی کارتل‌های مواد مخدر؛ تاثیر قانونی‌سازی سقط جنین در کاهش جرایم چندین سال بعد؛ نقش بسیار کم تربیت خوب کودکان توسط والدین در بهتر شدن آموزش و پرورششان؛ و الگوهای نامگذاری کودکان در یک جامعه. ا. شربیانی"
217,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249257-elise,3,"Levitt makes the lofty claim that economics is not swayed by moral sensibilities - it's a pure numbers game of course! However, not knowing much about him beyond his affiliation with the University of Chicago and what was written in the book, I can surmise that he is conservative, or at least what today would be inappropriately labeled ""moderate."" Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily...or at least I don't view it that way. Does it affect his conclusions? Absolutely. Levitt assumes his assertion that Roe v. Wade is responsible for the drop in crime experienced in the 1990s is the most controversial in the book, but I was not bothered by that conclusion at all. What did raise my ire a bit was his statement that ""Minorities commit more crimes."" Perhaps the pure numbers seem to show so, but upon closer examination and more careful thought, one might conclude that minorities are simply arrested and convicted more often. In many cases, Levitt does delve into the deeper ""behind the scenes"" reasons for why things happen, but in this glaring example, he delves no further than to admit that poverty might have a link to crime commission, and with more minorities in poverty more of them commit crimes. Might it also have a link to crime conviction? The white suburban kid who can afford a long and arduous defense, or whose father knows someone who can get the kid out of a jam, has a much better chance of having his case dismissed than a poor minority kid assigned a public defender (not to say that public defenders don't do good work - in fact many of them are some of the most amazing lawyers out there). Suffice to say the system is stacked against people in poverty and minorities, and Levitt fails to fully acknowledge this in his discussion of what causes and helps prevent crime. I wasn't so much angry as I was disappointed. When one of the brightest minds in our country can't see beyond his own prejudices, where is the hope for the rest of us? Levitt might be a genius, but he is woefully culturally incompetent. "
218,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/847862-paulius,1,"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (2005)There are intriguing elements in this book but when it comes to the larger picture, I find it sorely lacking. Levitt is a young star in the economics profession who enjoys playing games with interesting questions. For example, he assembles data to demonstrate that Roe v. Wade was critical to the drop in the crime rate in the 90s. On p. 125 he notes ""So it wasn't capital punishment that drove crime down, nor was it the booming economy. But higher rates of imprisonment did have a lot to do with it."" Also, on p. 139, he says ""Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness, unwantedness leads to high crime, legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime."" He also addresses the old nature vs. nurture argument or environment vs. genetics when he says, on pp. 175-176, ""Parents who are well educated, successful, and healthy tend to have children who test well in school, but it doesn't seem to much matter whether a child is trotted off to museums or spanked or sent to Head Start....The reality is that technique looks to be highly overrated....adopted children test relatively poorly in school, any influence the adoptive parents might exert is seemingly outweighed by the force of genetics. But...the parents were not powerless forever. By the time the adopted children bacame adults, they had veered sharply from the destiny that IQ alone might have predicted. Compared to similar children who were not put up for adoption, the adoptees were far more likely to attend college, to have a well-paid job, and to wait until they were out of their teens before getting married."" Despite these insights, I would never want to write a book like this because it doesn't go after the betterment of the human condition in a broad sense in the fashion that Adam Smith tried with Wealth of Nations in 1776. Levitt may be rewarded for his fun puzzles by a best-seller, but does any of this really help society toward healthier, happier families in the future?"
219,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4047121-william-moore,1,"Freakonomics: a rogue economist – Is that all there is?The title of Freakonomics tells us that Steven Levitt is a “rogue economist” exploring the “the hidden side of everything.” I have always been up for a rogue telling me about everything. Even a rogue telling me about anything appeals to me; you know that special insight that only a mischievous, perhaps unprincipled, but somehow likeable person has. From the title I even conjured up some noble rogue elephant tearing apart the civilized world after suffering a loss of habitat. I was up for rogue. Economics, I thought, is a damn good place for a rogue.Levitt is an economics professor at the University of Chicago and a winner of the John Bates Clark Medal. That medal is awarded every two years to the best economist under 40. It is given by the American Economic Association. If you know anything about this Vanderbilt University supported organization, it wouldn’t be for their search for rogues (although they got Milton Friedman right in 1951.)Steven Levitt is best-known for his findings on America’s falling crime-rate during the 1990s. Teenage murder rates were predicted to double. Instead they fell by more than 50% in the space of five years. By 2000 they were at their lowest in 35 years. But why? Well, a lot of people were taking the credit. They were citing economic growth, gun control, policing, imprisonment and even the death penalty as the reason. Levitt proved the cause as Roe vs Wade, the Supreme Court decision that lead to the repeal of abortion laws in the US. His research showed that children born into impoverished environments were more likely to grow up to become criminals. His analysis formed the elegant but uncomfortable syllogism: “Unwantedness leads to high crime; abortion leads to less unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime.”Levitt is saying, according to Dubner, that incentives and motivations are intimately linked in driving human behaviour. No breakthrough – my mum knew that! He does come through with some interesting proofs. His ingenious methods of analysing data reveal sometimes startling conclusions: Chicago public school teachers were helping their students cheat on state exams; Sumo wrestlers were fixing some of their matches; real-estate agents don’t really care about how much they sell your house for – only their own house, and my favourite; dope-dealers rarely make a good living. These results do amuse, surprise and even educate. In all these conclusions there is a haunting. Strangely, within these intriguing anomalies we never find that superbly-skilled rogue practitioner of economics. Instead we are left with a peppy little repertoire of cocktail chatter (beer-chat for me) and little else.Something went wrong in the writing of Freakonomics. In the reading there was the echo of Mark Twain’s comment that golf was “a good walk spoiled.” Yes it is provocative and interesting but it has a problem. If Malcolm Gladwell of Tipping Point fame says “Steven Levitt has the most interesting mind in America . . .” then the problem is uncompromisingly simple – we can’t find Levitt or his mind in this book!Without question we can find – actually, we can’t get away from – the other Stephen, Stephen Dubner. He is Levitt’s coauthor and a contributor to the New York Times. Dubner occasionally genuflects to Levitt’s genius, to his unique insight, and treats us to the odd passing anecdote. For most of the book though he relies on the coattails of Levitt to spin his own story.Dubner just doesn’t get Levitt. A flaw, especially given the hype in the title. He tells us that this very special economist is challenging the established lens through which we see conventional economics. The problem is what is conventional is never argued and the nature of the difference is never revealed. This new lens, we are told, uncovers – no exposes – the patterns of conventional thinking. These come by way of conclusive moments, end points really, that are sometimes remarkably fascinating and clearly capture interest. The question is, are these moments, this shopping-list of results, the only point of the book?Although Steven Levitt is apparently (or even paradoxically) the coauthor, he never actually appears. Not only is he not there but his methodology is never fully presented nor explained. Malcolm Gladwell goes on to say “. . . and reading Freakonomics is like going for a leisurely walk with him on a sunny summer day, as he waves his fingers in the air and turns everything you once thought to be true inside out.” Well the problem is we never get to go on that walk with Steven Levitt. He just might be nearby, but you never know for sure.The book is a first-person telling by Dubner. So it leaves Dubner responsible for that walk. It also leaves him responsible for the non-telling of either process or personality. It is an issue of depth. His preamble, along with the very bad An Explanatory Note are ill-chosen attempts at building an arcane, deified and mystical Steven Levitt. When we get into the book, we think we are going to meet Levitt, this “rogue economist” – but we never do.Dubner continually misses the mark. He let a good book and a great opportunity slip away. This is because he thinks the mark is simply some captivating Levitt conclusion. Even though I found myself relishing some of these points and was more than willing to tell these little tidbits to my friends; they leave forever undone some important thinking.The success of the book is that each story is portable. In their portability there is a weakness. If the point is, each story is an indicator of how we can mis-see the world, then how do we understand mis-seeing or recognise mis-telling? The only way to know would be to understand Levitt, economics, and the processes by which we make conventional and sometimes remarkably wrong conclusions.We never do. Instead, in each story there is an echo of missed opportunity. In each he takes us on some short walk on how we might see the world. The trouble is it is only a short walk with no critical path to understand how we got there or just where we might be going.Dubner tells us early on that when the publisher approached Steven Levitt, Levitt didn’t want to write a book. He finally did agree to write it, but along with Dubner who had done a story about him for the Times. So Dubner and the brilliant Levitt agree to coauthor. Freakonomics is the result of that division of labour. Presumably Levitt’s job was to continue mining of the reality of the “hidden side of everything.” Then what was Stephen Dubner’s job? The answer: The weaver of these disparate stories; the interpreter; the pattern-finder – the writer! Unfortunately a substantive telling never happens. It takes about half the book to slowly realize Dubner doesn’t really get Levitt – and neither do we.In the end this book bizarrely peters off into some kind of parenting manual. This is presumably because Dubner and Levitt are young fathers. Who knows? Dubner then thinks he can put Humpty back together by saying in the Epilogue that there is “no unifying theme” in Freakonomics. Well he got that right! Here he is alluding to a quote by the philosopher Robert Nozick where Nozick said that at 26 Levitt didn’t need a “unifying theme” as an economist. This may be right for a young economist – but it is not necessarily true of a book.Dubner’s patchwork attempt at an ending only exacerbates the reality of missed opportunity. Unfortunately it causes Freakonomics to read a bit like: What my really important really smart friend did on his summer vacation.William Moore"

Something like ""freakostatistics"" would make much more sense as the name of the book.2. in the introduction, the writers warn us that correlation does not imply causality. OK, agreed. But the rest of the book is just that: THEY act as if correlation and causality are the same thing (but they just have more ""fun"" explanation for stuff). What exactly is their proof that they are not ""inventing explanations"" based on correlation, without any real evidence of causation?This book is just a pile of interesting nonsense.EDIT (2016): There is another thing in the authors' arguments that really bother me (besides the ""correlation vs causality"" debate). The authors' approach to economics is that economics is all about how incentives play out. While incentives are no doubt important in human behaviour, this is an extremely shallow way of talking about economics. It is also very consistent with ""unfettered free market"" ideology, which says that the best way to organize society is through profit incentive. This is a dangerous proposition (as we have seen in 2008) and scientifically very doubtful."

The worst part was definitely his sweeping assumptions and conclusions based on his oh-so-reliable data. He thinks he can get away with this because the preface of the book says that he doesn't come to any conclusions--just asking questions, but the writing SUGGESTS conclusions. Just look at the subtitle, ""the Hidden Side of Everything."" He manipulates the reader into thinking there are connections between things by placing the data and a possible explanation on the same page. The problem with those explanations is that there is no scientific approach. Most of his data are purely observational--which is inherently flawed when trying to find cause and effect. I think the book started off wrong when the so-called economist claimed that he didn't like calculus. I'm not sure how you can call yourself an economist without calculus... Maybe you can't... and maybe that's why this book doesn't work."

In true Chicago School style he pits unbridled laissez-faire at all and sundry in his whimsical little fashion. What we get is a truly melon-scratching mixture of sleight-of-hand and pop economics that revels in its eccentricity while being simultaneously superficial and misleading. Avoid. Avoid if you possibly can."
225,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17533257-jesse-lehrer,1,"The overarching point of this book is absolutely correct: conventional wisdom and what we perceive to be logical often is not. Our society is wrapped up and smothered in incorrect, dysfunctional assumptions that continue to rule our world and ruin our lives. Bigotry, ignorance, prejudice, fear, and the way people in power use these tools to divide and conquer us is at the root of all of our problems.That being said - everything else in this book is mediocre to bad. The writers make repeated assumptions and statements that are just flat out wrong. They make interesting points, and their comparisons are often thought provoking, but they could have used more of their own medicine.This book is clearly written by economists. Economics is one of the most useless, garbage ideologies ever created by humans. This is, of course, my opinion - but this book, I feel, only serves to prove that opinion. Over and over again the authors try to narrow down causes to one thing or another. They try to find the factor that changed everything. The abortion/crime essay is the clearest - abortion being legal is NOT the only factor that led to crime going down. There are thousands of factors that all contribute to everything that happens. Economists like to boil things down to numbers - instead of looking at people, looking at the complexity of life, they want a simple answer. There are no simple answers.In the book the authors do, occasionally, note that just one thing is not the cause - but they then go back on this again and again by making ridiculous statements, ie:""What sort of woman was most likely to take advantage of Roe v. Wade? Very often she was unmarried or in her teens or poor and sometimes all three."" This sentence gives the image of the typical woman getting an abortion to be a poor teenage girl. They don't say that's the majority, but the implication by choosing this example is that it's the norm. This is absolutely false - Planned Parenthood has plenty of information on this - the most common type of woman who gets an abortion is a woman who has already had a kid(s) and accidentally got pregnant and didn't want another kid. No stereotyping, no images of teenagers making bad choices, etc.Then there's this gem: ""Black Americans were hurt more by crack cocaine than by any other single cause since Jim Crow""I almost stopped reading the book there. That is so wrong, so offensive, so ignorant it is utterly ridiculous. There is NO SINGLE CAUSE of anything! This reductionist economist bullshit is exactly why I hate economics. And if there was a single cause - it wasn't fucking crack. It was racism, or structural racism, or criminalizing of young black people, or economic segregation, or reagonomics, or zoning laws, or re-districting, etc. etc. etc. Crack ruining black communities is, in actuality, a myth. Yes, it's a problem, yes, drug addiction in all forms is terrible, but this myth that crack just fell on black communities like a nuclear bomb leaving nothing behind but violence and death is just plain false. Additionally: the crackdown on drugs came BEFORE crack became an issue - it was a political device pre-dating crack used by Reagan to get votes from ignorant white people who feared black people. There are many books documenting this.In short: there are interesting points in this book, and the overall point is absolutely true. We all fall into believing bullshit that feels like it's obvious but is not. It's up to us individually, and as a society, to always seek the truth. However - the truth is not provided in a 20 page article as a single answer. If only the authors took their own ideas further the book might actually be worth something."

To be honest, I really don't see how this author can be taken seriously. This book should be a farce to anyone who has any degree of skeptical thinking; any degree of respect for logic or empirical thought.Leavitt's conclusions are stretched like a rubber chicken (if not shot like one), his correlations are spurious at best, and his conclusions are no more insightful or incisive as what you would hear at a bull session with your friends, sitting around a bar, after knocking back a half dozen brews.Seriously, i really don't get all the hoopla that this title receives. Leavitt's only real talent seems to be collecting lists from public records sources, and then drawing the most asinine conclusions from them, and then writing them up with an ironic tone, just to sound smart. He seems to have accomplished a feat that would make PT Barnum proud... he thought up the most absurd conclusions, passed them off as expert observations, and then by sheer force of will got people to believe him. (You know the saying, ""the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it."")This tripe reminds of ""Who Moved My Cheese"" which was the biggest sham of a marketing snow job ever perpetrated in print, but was somehow widely hailed by business thinkers as a stroke of genius. This happened mainly because the first batch of readers, who got suckered into seriously reading it, didn't want to admit to everyone else that they got suckered into buying (for about 15 bucks) what amounted to bedtime story that any nanny could have come up with on the spot. So they proceeded to tell everyone they knew that the glorified pamphlet was actually wiser than the combined teachings of Confucious. Freakonomics should spend a whole chapter on that.The only real saving grace I found about the book is that I didn't pay full price for it. Ok, so now you know how I really feel about the book.

Which is a pity, as what it has to say is terribly interesting and amusing.The stuff at the end about how the name you are born with affects your life is very interesting. Also the idea, that is clearly true, but I'd never thought of it before, that people give their daughters crazier names than their sons.The point of this book is to say that sometimes there are very interesting correlations between things that seem quite disparate. The big one (and I haven't checked, but I assume this one didn't go down terribly well with the religious right in America) was the idea that the drop in violent crime in the US was due to the drop in violent criminals and this was due to there being less people brought up in abject poverty which is due to people being able to have access to abortion and not bringing unwanted children into the world.The comparisons between drug dealers and McDonalds as a corporate structure is now received wisdom - Obama quotes this in his book.Overall this is a great little read and quite fun - but really, I can't think of a single book that was improved by self-congratulation."

I like the questions they posed and the connections they came up with. I was quite surprised about the American school system, especially the fact that teachers often used cheating methods to make sure their students scored well in standardized tests.The section about how given names may influence one's future was quite gloomy in some ways, especially as there's evidence that we are judged based on our names, not on our abilities. All in all, a lot of great information."

Personally, I'm enjoying living in a free (for now) country and I'd like people like him to go away to some socialist country so they can be happy with others like him. Now I understand we have ""free speech"" and all that, and I'm happy we have that, but stuff like this just rubs me the wrong way. Knowing that people who live in this country, which, by the way, is not perfect, print this crap for others to read is maddening. Listen, if you don't like the country, leave!

They put on a ""freak"" show of data (their term choice) to make a sensation and lull the lay economist into thinking they've learned something. I read several reviews of this book and it appears people who know about the subject are appalled by their poor analysis, contrived conclusions, and use of unreliable research to make sensationalized claims. Maybe I'm stating it a little strongly, but it has been over two years since I read this book and I'm still angry about one of their premises. The authors proposed that crime rates went down due to the increase in abortions some 15 years earlier. Yes, they claim society is better off without the kids whose parents apparently didn't want them ever having a chance to grow up to be the miscreants they'd be destined to become. That may be a correlation but it is a huge stretch to claim it is a cause and effect. (The decreased crime rate is much better explained by Strauss & Howe in  Generations , by the way.)

If pressed, I'd assign this book to a category I'd call ""Books That People Who Love Malcolm Gladwell Might Also Enjoy."" There's no doubt that Steven D. Levitt is an expert number-cruncher, organizer, and researcher. The conclusions with which he attempts to wow the reader, however, are specious, hyperbolic, and generally lame-o-zoid.*Here's an example: The author explains a situation in which a parent will not permit their young child to go over to a friend's house because the child's friend's parents keep a gun in their home. The [first] parent, however, WILL allow their child to visit a DIFFERENT friend's house whose parents do NOT have a gun, but whose family has a swimming pool. The book then goes on to explain the statistics behind how many children die of gun deaths in this country in a given year versus how many children die in swimming pools in this country each year and determines that the [original] parent is not, according to the data, acting reasonably due to the fact that the likelihood of the child dying in a swimming pool far outweighs the likelihood of the child dying from a gun. Now, there's a reason why, when we talk about gun-safety, we don't talk about swimming pools. It's because swimming pools, if you'd believe it, don't have anything to do with gun safety.** In fact, that entire statistic-set, while an interesting mental exercise, is really no help to the parent. The statistic, were I a parent, that I would be interested in learning is something like: Out of all of the situations involving children dying from gun wounds in this country in a given year, how many of those instances took place when the child was visiting a friend's house? I don't know the answer to that, so, I'll just continue to be pleasantly outraged and move on to my next thought.This book, at its root, is arguing that the things we take for granted, like, belief-wise, might not only not be the case, but the actual truth of the matter(s) might be completely and utterly counter-intuitive to what we feel to be right. I think that's a great message and I wish this was simply a thinking-outside-the-box appreciation book. As a matter of fact, that's exactly what the [nearly two page] epilogue is arguing. With that in mind, I whole-heartedly recommend this book's epilogue. If, however, you're actually looking for a book to explain the hidden, counter-intuitive side to everything, like, for RIZZ, I'd recommend ""Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences"" by John Allen Paulos. BONUS THOUGHT: I should make it clear that I feel that the reason that ""Freakonomics"" is famous and ""Innumeracy"" is not famous, despite the fact that Mr. Paulos uses fewer pages to say more things more clearly, has to do with the fact that there is actual mathematics involved in the latter while the former just requires the reader to want to feel as though they're a smart person. FIN*But, some are for defs totes awes!**I certainly understand the value in thinking abstractly about complicated questions as a way to expand one's mind/cognitive-like-sitch; it's the conclusion that I'm attacking here."
238,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18423957-eleni,2,"For a book that so heavily relies on (mostly) untested assumptions, the repeated, passionate references to the distinction between causality and correlation is impressive if not audacious, to say the least. Suffice to say, 
“""As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions"".
 Exactly, Stephen. And that would work extremely well as an inside joke too. Unless you are implying that, in contrast with the usual textbooks, 
Freakonomics
 actually uses science to pose those questions. In which case, and given the absolute lack of evidence, statistics and insight on any methodological tools here, I can’t help wondering: Science? What science? Where? GIVE ME ONE PAGE. The other unfortunate thing here is the 
“Revised and Expanded edition”
 issue, which can generally mean a number of things, but in the case of 
Freakonomics
 in specific, it was, as we know, the result of a huge wave of negative feedback from reviewers due to:a) the fact that the authors massively exaggerated some of their assumptions (because, obviously: when you think you’re using science when you really are not, that’s just bound to happen) and, as if this isn't enough already, the authors’ reliance on some quite noticeable mathematical monstrosities.b) The self-praise:“Hi. I’m Stephen J. Dubner. And I’m co-authoring this book. The other author is Steven D. Levitt and he’s such a genius, radical economist that we’re thinking we’ll stuff 
Freakonomics
 with tons of newspaper clippings on how awesome he is. And that’s gonna be all over the place. Yes! Oh, in case you’re wondering what a too-cool-for-school unconventional genius like Steven D. Levitt is doing writing books instead of just being a weird recluse in permanent scientific euphoria, worry not! He wasn't interested in writing anything, silly ones (as if)! Not unless it was with me, because, in case you haven’t figured it out already, I’m a kickarse, amazing journalist too! So please read us. Please. We’ll make you feel important and scientific”.So apparently they got the message and scrapped most of that out of the book, hence the 
“Revised and Expanded”
 edition.But honestly, when I found all that out, for a moment I thought I needed to double check that I was actually reading the revised thing.I was? Really? REALLY? WHAT WAS THE FIRST VERSION LIKE THEN?And it’s certainly not my fault that Nick Hornby has the answer to nearly everything. I don’t remember which issue of The Believer he wrote that in, but it was along the lines of: 
""Freakonomics
 was a cool book and it made me feel smart. But what was it about?”Exactly, thank you.Two stars, because some of the questions they pose have interesting political and social implications, even though all questions are always posed through prose (with the use of loose logic at best) and absolutely not through the use of science.Oh.

It's been on my to-read list for a long time, and after finally got around to reading it, I came away disappointed. The book is mostly a disjointed series of unexpected pairings phrased as questions, like ""What do sumo wrestlers and real estate agents have in common?"" Most of the questions would never be anything an average person would ask or wonder about. The book was a haphazard compilation of these pairings and odd questions but, to be fair, the authors explicitly state that from the get-go. I found the sections on parenting and naming babies to be the most interesting, with the rest of it being on the dull side. Many of these questions felt artificially contrived to create a ""freaky"" spin on economics but it felt forced. That was my chief issue with the book - it felt like it was trying to hard to be edgy and hip, like a geeky kid who tries to impress by looking cool and winds up falling flat.I found Dan Arielly's book, Predictably Irrational to be much more entertaining with a smoother flow. Arielly's book deals with behavioral economics and delves into the reasons why people make the choices they do, some of which seem rational but aren't and others which seem irrational but aren't. Arielly's book left me with a greater insight into my own choices and the mechanisms at work behind them. Freakonomics left me with a general thought of ""Hmm, seemingly unrelated stuff is actually related and vice versa."" For anyone interested in behavior economics presented in a very accessible and entertaining manner, I would recommend Arielly's book over Freakonomics, hands down."

If it were not for the practicalities of travelling, I would probably have bought this book much sooner than I did for I had been securing extra minutes in airport bookstores just to read through another chapter long before I actually bought it.You see, my travels are laden with a heavy debate: shall I pack my extra suitcase with books or groceries? I resolve this by alternating. For one trip to the Outside, a spare duffel bag will be dedicated to books and I will shun all opportunities to visit grocery stores just to preserve that determination. On the next visit, I will carry a spare cooler (rather than duffel bag) and splurge on leg of lamb and cheeses free of artificial coloring. The ultimate effect of this system, however, is a backlog in possessing the books I'd like to read.Finally, however, the fates aligned. I was travelling to Iowa on what I expected to be a gloriously grocery-focused trip. But my cooler broke as I was carrying it to the truck that we would drive to our local airport. There wasn't time to fix it. I was sad, of course, as I had been anticipating all the pork I was going to return with from Iowa. But I consoled myself with all those Iowa cookbooks I could now carry, and resolved not to prolong any lamentations over the cooler. And, oh, did I find myself lugging around a heavy library - such hours did I spend in Powells (there was a 1 week layover in Oregon) and Iowa City's bookstores. The day before we left Iowa, Nate told me about how much he enjoyed this book. His description renewed my interest, and I committed myself to buying a copy before we left. But, alas, we ran out of time. We didn't make it to a bookstore. It was sadder than the last-minute loss of the cooler. So when we arrived in Chicago, and had a few minutes to wait for the connecting flight to Alaska, and our gate was right next to a book kiosk, and I was pretty sure there was just enough room in my carry-on to squeeze in one more book - it was this book that I grabbed. I raced through it. Loving each chapter. I really can't recommend it enough. A fun read, for those who like to be entertained by books. Informative too, for those that like to read for knowledge, thought, and/or discourse. But what elevates it to favorite is that it alters perception and challenges assumptions. For what it's worth, I have no regrets that I carried this book rather than Iowa pork.....and I can think of no finer testament to a good book. Then again, most of my entertainment these days revolves around pickling turnips.

DubnerFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything is the debut non-fiction book by University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and New York Times journalist Stephen J. Dubner. It was published on April 12, 2005, by William Morrow. The book has been described as melding pop culture with economics. By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide. The book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by ""traditional"" economists. In Freakonomics, Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of incentives. The book's chapters cover:Chapter 1: Discovering cheating as applied to teachers and sumo wrestlers, as well as a typical Washington, D.C.–area bagel business and its customersChapter 2: Information control as applied to the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agentsChapter 3: The economics of drug dealing, including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealersChapter 4: The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime, contrasted with the policies and downfall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled ""The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime,"" written with John Donohue.)Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good parenting on educationChapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children (nominative determinism)تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه آگوست سال 2008 میلادیعنوان: اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های پنهان اجتماعی؛ نویسنده: استیون لویت، استپان‌ دابنر؛ مترجم: سعید مشیری؛ تهران: نشر نی‏‫، 1386؛ در 269 ص؛ شابک: 9789643129507؛ چاپ دوم 1392؛ موضوع: اقتصاد از نویسندگان امریکایی - جنبه های روانشناسی - سده 21 معنوان: اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها؛ نویسنده: استیون دی‌. لویت؛ مترجم: امیرحسین توکلی؛ تهران: سبزان‏‫، 1385؛ در 197 ص؛ شابک: 9789648249674؛ عنوان روی جلد: اقتصاد علم انگیزه‌ها: مهارت‌های لازم برای کشف ابعاد پنهان پدیده‌ها؛‬کتاب «فریکونومیکس» در باره ی اقتصاد، از اقتصاددان دانشگاه شیکاگو «استیون لویت» است، که نخستین بار در روز دوازدهم ماه آوریل سال 2005 میلادی منتشر شد. این کتاب تا پایان سال 2009 میلادی، بیش از چهار میلیون نسخه فروش داشته است. کتاب با عنوان «اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های اجتماعی» توسط نشر نی و با ترجمه ی جناب «سعید مشیری»، و با عنوان: «اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها»؛ با ترجمه ی جناب «امیرحسین توکلی»، منتشر شده است. کتاب چندین فصل دارد: درباره حقه زدن در شغل‌هایی مانند معلمی و کشتی‌گیران سومو؛ شباهت‌های کوکلوس‌کلان‌ و افراد معاملات ملکی؛ سیستم اقتصادی کارتل‌های مواد مخدر؛ تاثیر قانونی‌سازی سقط جنین در کاهش جرایم چندین سال بعد؛ نقش بسیار کم تربیت خوب کودکان توسط والدین در بهتر شدن آموزش و پرورششان؛ و الگوهای نامگذاری کودکان در یک جامعه. ا. شربیانی"
247,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249257-elise,3,"Levitt makes the lofty claim that economics is not swayed by moral sensibilities - it's a pure numbers game of course! However, not knowing much about him beyond his affiliation with the University of Chicago and what was written in the book, I can surmise that he is conservative, or at least what today would be inappropriately labeled ""moderate."" Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily...or at least I don't view it that way. Does it affect his conclusions? Absolutely. Levitt assumes his assertion that Roe v. Wade is responsible for the drop in crime experienced in the 1990s is the most controversial in the book, but I was not bothered by that conclusion at all. What did raise my ire a bit was his statement that ""Minorities commit more crimes."" Perhaps the pure numbers seem to show so, but upon closer examination and more careful thought, one might conclude that minorities are simply arrested and convicted more often. In many cases, Levitt does delve into the deeper ""behind the scenes"" reasons for why things happen, but in this glaring example, he delves no further than to admit that poverty might have a link to crime commission, and with more minorities in poverty more of them commit crimes. Might it also have a link to crime conviction? The white suburban kid who can afford a long and arduous defense, or whose father knows someone who can get the kid out of a jam, has a much better chance of having his case dismissed than a poor minority kid assigned a public defender (not to say that public defenders don't do good work - in fact many of them are some of the most amazing lawyers out there). Suffice to say the system is stacked against people in poverty and minorities, and Levitt fails to fully acknowledge this in his discussion of what causes and helps prevent crime. I wasn't so much angry as I was disappointed. When one of the brightest minds in our country can't see beyond his own prejudices, where is the hope for the rest of us? Levitt might be a genius, but he is woefully culturally incompetent. "
248,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/847862-paulius,1,"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (2005)There are intriguing elements in this book but when it comes to the larger picture, I find it sorely lacking. Levitt is a young star in the economics profession who enjoys playing games with interesting questions. For example, he assembles data to demonstrate that Roe v. Wade was critical to the drop in the crime rate in the 90s. On p. 125 he notes ""So it wasn't capital punishment that drove crime down, nor was it the booming economy. But higher rates of imprisonment did have a lot to do with it."" Also, on p. 139, he says ""Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness, unwantedness leads to high crime, legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime."" He also addresses the old nature vs. nurture argument or environment vs. genetics when he says, on pp. 175-176, ""Parents who are well educated, successful, and healthy tend to have children who test well in school, but it doesn't seem to much matter whether a child is trotted off to museums or spanked or sent to Head Start....The reality is that technique looks to be highly overrated....adopted children test relatively poorly in school, any influence the adoptive parents might exert is seemingly outweighed by the force of genetics. But...the parents were not powerless forever. By the time the adopted children bacame adults, they had veered sharply from the destiny that IQ alone might have predicted. Compared to similar children who were not put up for adoption, the adoptees were far more likely to attend college, to have a well-paid job, and to wait until they were out of their teens before getting married."" Despite these insights, I would never want to write a book like this because it doesn't go after the betterment of the human condition in a broad sense in the fashion that Adam Smith tried with Wealth of Nations in 1776. Levitt may be rewarded for his fun puzzles by a best-seller, but does any of this really help society toward healthier, happier families in the future?"
249,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4047121-william-moore,1,"Freakonomics: a rogue economist – Is that all there is?The title of Freakonomics tells us that Steven Levitt is a “rogue economist” exploring the “the hidden side of everything.” I have always been up for a rogue telling me about everything. Even a rogue telling me about anything appeals to me; you know that special insight that only a mischievous, perhaps unprincipled, but somehow likeable person has. From the title I even conjured up some noble rogue elephant tearing apart the civilized world after suffering a loss of habitat. I was up for rogue. Economics, I thought, is a damn good place for a rogue.Levitt is an economics professor at the University of Chicago and a winner of the John Bates Clark Medal. That medal is awarded every two years to the best economist under 40. It is given by the American Economic Association. If you know anything about this Vanderbilt University supported organization, it wouldn’t be for their search for rogues (although they got Milton Friedman right in 1951.)Steven Levitt is best-known for his findings on America’s falling crime-rate during the 1990s. Teenage murder rates were predicted to double. Instead they fell by more than 50% in the space of five years. By 2000 they were at their lowest in 35 years. But why? Well, a lot of people were taking the credit. They were citing economic growth, gun control, policing, imprisonment and even the death penalty as the reason. Levitt proved the cause as Roe vs Wade, the Supreme Court decision that lead to the repeal of abortion laws in the US. His research showed that children born into impoverished environments were more likely to grow up to become criminals. His analysis formed the elegant but uncomfortable syllogism: “Unwantedness leads to high crime; abortion leads to less unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime.”Levitt is saying, according to Dubner, that incentives and motivations are intimately linked in driving human behaviour. No breakthrough – my mum knew that! He does come through with some interesting proofs. His ingenious methods of analysing data reveal sometimes startling conclusions: Chicago public school teachers were helping their students cheat on state exams; Sumo wrestlers were fixing some of their matches; real-estate agents don’t really care about how much they sell your house for – only their own house, and my favourite; dope-dealers rarely make a good living. These results do amuse, surprise and even educate. In all these conclusions there is a haunting. Strangely, within these intriguing anomalies we never find that superbly-skilled rogue practitioner of economics. Instead we are left with a peppy little repertoire of cocktail chatter (beer-chat for me) and little else.Something went wrong in the writing of Freakonomics. In the reading there was the echo of Mark Twain’s comment that golf was “a good walk spoiled.” Yes it is provocative and interesting but it has a problem. If Malcolm Gladwell of Tipping Point fame says “Steven Levitt has the most interesting mind in America . . .” then the problem is uncompromisingly simple – we can’t find Levitt or his mind in this book!Without question we can find – actually, we can’t get away from – the other Stephen, Stephen Dubner. He is Levitt’s coauthor and a contributor to the New York Times. Dubner occasionally genuflects to Levitt’s genius, to his unique insight, and treats us to the odd passing anecdote. For most of the book though he relies on the coattails of Levitt to spin his own story.Dubner just doesn’t get Levitt. A flaw, especially given the hype in the title. He tells us that this very special economist is challenging the established lens through which we see conventional economics. The problem is what is conventional is never argued and the nature of the difference is never revealed. This new lens, we are told, uncovers – no exposes – the patterns of conventional thinking. These come by way of conclusive moments, end points really, that are sometimes remarkably fascinating and clearly capture interest. The question is, are these moments, this shopping-list of results, the only point of the book?Although Steven Levitt is apparently (or even paradoxically) the coauthor, he never actually appears. Not only is he not there but his methodology is never fully presented nor explained. Malcolm Gladwell goes on to say “. . . and reading Freakonomics is like going for a leisurely walk with him on a sunny summer day, as he waves his fingers in the air and turns everything you once thought to be true inside out.” Well the problem is we never get to go on that walk with Steven Levitt. He just might be nearby, but you never know for sure.The book is a first-person telling by Dubner. So it leaves Dubner responsible for that walk. It also leaves him responsible for the non-telling of either process or personality. It is an issue of depth. His preamble, along with the very bad An Explanatory Note are ill-chosen attempts at building an arcane, deified and mystical Steven Levitt. When we get into the book, we think we are going to meet Levitt, this “rogue economist” – but we never do.Dubner continually misses the mark. He let a good book and a great opportunity slip away. This is because he thinks the mark is simply some captivating Levitt conclusion. Even though I found myself relishing some of these points and was more than willing to tell these little tidbits to my friends; they leave forever undone some important thinking.The success of the book is that each story is portable. In their portability there is a weakness. If the point is, each story is an indicator of how we can mis-see the world, then how do we understand mis-seeing or recognise mis-telling? The only way to know would be to understand Levitt, economics, and the processes by which we make conventional and sometimes remarkably wrong conclusions.We never do. Instead, in each story there is an echo of missed opportunity. In each he takes us on some short walk on how we might see the world. The trouble is it is only a short walk with no critical path to understand how we got there or just where we might be going.Dubner tells us early on that when the publisher approached Steven Levitt, Levitt didn’t want to write a book. He finally did agree to write it, but along with Dubner who had done a story about him for the Times. So Dubner and the brilliant Levitt agree to coauthor. Freakonomics is the result of that division of labour. Presumably Levitt’s job was to continue mining of the reality of the “hidden side of everything.” Then what was Stephen Dubner’s job? The answer: The weaver of these disparate stories; the interpreter; the pattern-finder – the writer! Unfortunately a substantive telling never happens. It takes about half the book to slowly realize Dubner doesn’t really get Levitt – and neither do we.In the end this book bizarrely peters off into some kind of parenting manual. This is presumably because Dubner and Levitt are young fathers. Who knows? Dubner then thinks he can put Humpty back together by saying in the Epilogue that there is “no unifying theme” in Freakonomics. Well he got that right! Here he is alluding to a quote by the philosopher Robert Nozick where Nozick said that at 26 Levitt didn’t need a “unifying theme” as an economist. This may be right for a young economist – but it is not necessarily true of a book.Dubner’s patchwork attempt at an ending only exacerbates the reality of missed opportunity. Unfortunately it causes Freakonomics to read a bit like: What my really important really smart friend did on his summer vacation.William Moore"

Something like ""freakostatistics"" would make much more sense as the name of the book.2. in the introduction, the writers warn us that correlation does not imply causality. OK, agreed. But the rest of the book is just that: THEY act as if correlation and causality are the same thing (but they just have more ""fun"" explanation for stuff). What exactly is their proof that they are not ""inventing explanations"" based on correlation, without any real evidence of causation?This book is just a pile of interesting nonsense.EDIT (2016): There is another thing in the authors' arguments that really bother me (besides the ""correlation vs causality"" debate). The authors' approach to economics is that economics is all about how incentives play out. While incentives are no doubt important in human behaviour, this is an extremely shallow way of talking about economics. It is also very consistent with ""unfettered free market"" ideology, which says that the best way to organize society is through profit incentive. This is a dangerous proposition (as we have seen in 2008) and scientifically very doubtful."

The worst part was definitely his sweeping assumptions and conclusions based on his oh-so-reliable data. He thinks he can get away with this because the preface of the book says that he doesn't come to any conclusions--just asking questions, but the writing SUGGESTS conclusions. Just look at the subtitle, ""the Hidden Side of Everything."" He manipulates the reader into thinking there are connections between things by placing the data and a possible explanation on the same page. The problem with those explanations is that there is no scientific approach. Most of his data are purely observational--which is inherently flawed when trying to find cause and effect. I think the book started off wrong when the so-called economist claimed that he didn't like calculus. I'm not sure how you can call yourself an economist without calculus... Maybe you can't... and maybe that's why this book doesn't work."

What we get is a truly melon-scratching mixture of sleight-of-hand and pop economics that revels in its eccentricity while being simultaneously superficial and misleading. Avoid. Avoid if you possibly can."
255,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17533257-jesse-lehrer,1,"The overarching point of this book is absolutely correct: conventional wisdom and what we perceive to be logical often is not. Our society is wrapped up and smothered in incorrect, dysfunctional assumptions that continue to rule our world and ruin our lives. Bigotry, ignorance, prejudice, fear, and the way people in power use these tools to divide and conquer us is at the root of all of our problems.That being said - everything else in this book is mediocre to bad. The writers make repeated assumptions and statements that are just flat out wrong. They make interesting points, and their comparisons are often thought provoking, but they could have used more of their own medicine.This book is clearly written by economists. Economics is one of the most useless, garbage ideologies ever created by humans. This is, of course, my opinion - but this book, I feel, only serves to prove that opinion. Over and over again the authors try to narrow down causes to one thing or another. They try to find the factor that changed everything. The abortion/crime essay is the clearest - abortion being legal is NOT the only factor that led to crime going down. There are thousands of factors that all contribute to everything that happens. Economists like to boil things down to numbers - instead of looking at people, looking at the complexity of life, they want a simple answer. There are no simple answers.In the book the authors do, occasionally, note that just one thing is not the cause - but they then go back on this again and again by making ridiculous statements, ie:""What sort of woman was most likely to take advantage of Roe v. Wade? Very often she was unmarried or in her teens or poor and sometimes all three."" This sentence gives the image of the typical woman getting an abortion to be a poor teenage girl. They don't say that's the majority, but the implication by choosing this example is that it's the norm. This is absolutely false - Planned Parenthood has plenty of information on this - the most common type of woman who gets an abortion is a woman who has already had a kid(s) and accidentally got pregnant and didn't want another kid. No stereotyping, no images of teenagers making bad choices, etc.Then there's this gem: ""Black Americans were hurt more by crack cocaine than by any other single cause since Jim Crow""I almost stopped reading the book there. That is so wrong, so offensive, so ignorant it is utterly ridiculous. There is NO SINGLE CAUSE of anything! This reductionist economist bullshit is exactly why I hate economics. And if there was a single cause - it wasn't fucking crack. It was racism, or structural racism, or criminalizing of young black people, or economic segregation, or reagonomics, or zoning laws, or re-districting, etc. etc. etc. Crack ruining black communities is, in actuality, a myth. Yes, it's a problem, yes, drug addiction in all forms is terrible, but this myth that crack just fell on black communities like a nuclear bomb leaving nothing behind but violence and death is just plain false. Additionally: the crackdown on drugs came BEFORE crack became an issue - it was a political device pre-dating crack used by Reagan to get votes from ignorant white people who feared black people. There are many books documenting this.In short: there are interesting points in this book, and the overall point is absolutely true. We all fall into believing bullshit that feels like it's obvious but is not. It's up to us individually, and as a society, to always seek the truth. However - the truth is not provided in a 20 page article as a single answer. If only the authors took their own ideas further the book might actually be worth something."

To be honest, I really don't see how this author can be taken seriously. This book should be a farce to anyone who has any degree of skeptical thinking; any degree of respect for logic or empirical thought.Leavitt's conclusions are stretched like a rubber chicken (if not shot like one), his correlations are spurious at best, and his conclusions are no more insightful or incisive as what you would hear at a bull session with your friends, sitting around a bar, after knocking back a half dozen brews.Seriously, i really don't get all the hoopla that this title receives. Leavitt's only real talent seems to be collecting lists from public records sources, and then drawing the most asinine conclusions from them, and then writing them up with an ironic tone, just to sound smart. He seems to have accomplished a feat that would make PT Barnum proud... he thought up the most absurd conclusions, passed them off as expert observations, and then by sheer force of will got people to believe him. (You know the saying, ""the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it."")This tripe reminds of ""Who Moved My Cheese"" which was the biggest sham of a marketing snow job ever perpetrated in print, but was somehow widely hailed by business thinkers as a stroke of genius. This happened mainly because the first batch of readers, who got suckered into seriously reading it, didn't want to admit to everyone else that they got suckered into buying (for about 15 bucks) what amounted to bedtime story that any nanny could have come up with on the spot. So they proceeded to tell everyone they knew that the glorified pamphlet was actually wiser than the combined teachings of Confucious. Freakonomics should spend a whole chapter on that.The only real saving grace I found about the book is that I didn't pay full price for it. Ok, so now you know how I really feel about the book. Seriously, instead of buying this book, go spend your money on blue jeans, you're time will be better spent."

Also the idea, that is clearly true, but I'd never thought of it before, that people give their daughters crazier names than their sons.The point of this book is to say that sometimes there are very interesting correlations between things that seem quite disparate. The big one (and I haven't checked, but I assume this one didn't go down terribly well with the religious right in America) was the idea that the drop in violent crime in the US was due to the drop in violent criminals and this was due to there being less people brought up in abject poverty which is due to people being able to have access to abortion and not bringing unwanted children into the world.The comparisons between drug dealers and McDonalds as a corporate structure is now received wisdom - Obama quotes this in his book.Overall this is a great little read and quite fun - but really, I can't think of a single book that was improved by self-congratulation."

Maybe I'm stating it a little strongly, but it has been over two years since I read this book and I'm still angry about one of their premises. The authors proposed that crime rates went down due to the increase in abortions some 15 years earlier. Yes, they claim society is better off without the kids whose parents apparently didn't want them ever having a chance to grow up to be the miscreants they'd be destined to become. That may be a correlation but it is a huge stretch to claim it is a cause and effect. (The decreased crime rate is much better explained by Strauss & Howe in  Generations , by the way.)

If pressed, I'd assign this book to a category I'd call ""Books That People Who Love Malcolm Gladwell Might Also Enjoy."" There's no doubt that Steven D. Levitt is an expert number-cruncher, organizer, and researcher. The conclusions with which he attempts to wow the reader, however, are specious, hyperbolic, and generally lame-o-zoid.*Here's an example: The author explains a situation in which a parent will not permit their young child to go over to a friend's house because the child's friend's parents keep a gun in their home. The [first] parent, however, WILL allow their child to visit a DIFFERENT friend's house whose parents do NOT have a gun, but whose family has a swimming pool. The book then goes on to explain the statistics behind how many children die of gun deaths in this country in a given year versus how many children die in swimming pools in this country each year and determines that the [original] parent is not, according to the data, acting reasonably due to the fact that the likelihood of the child dying in a swimming pool far outweighs the likelihood of the child dying from a gun. Now, there's a reason why, when we talk about gun-safety, we don't talk about swimming pools. It's because swimming pools, if you'd believe it, don't have anything to do with gun safety.** In fact, that entire statistic-set, while an interesting mental exercise, is really no help to the parent. The statistic, were I a parent, that I would be interested in learning is something like: Out of all of the situations involving children dying from gun wounds in this country in a given year, how many of those instances took place when the child was visiting a friend's house? I don't know the answer to that, so, I'll just continue to be pleasantly outraged and move on to my next thought.This book, at its root, is arguing that the things we take for granted, like, belief-wise, might not only not be the case, but the actual truth of the matter(s) might be completely and utterly counter-intuitive to what we feel to be right. I think that's a great message and I wish this was simply a thinking-outside-the-box appreciation book. As a matter of fact, that's exactly what the [nearly two page] epilogue is arguing. With that in mind, I whole-heartedly recommend this book's epilogue. If, however, you're actually looking for a book to explain the hidden, counter-intuitive side to everything, like, for RIZZ, I'd recommend ""Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences"" by John Allen Paulos. BONUS THOUGHT: I should make it clear that I feel that the reason that ""Freakonomics"" is famous and ""Innumeracy"" is not famous, despite the fact that Mr. Paulos uses fewer pages to say more things more clearly, has to do with the fact that there is actual mathematics involved in the latter while the former just requires the reader to want to feel as though they're a smart person. FIN*But, some are for defs totes awes!**I certainly understand the value in thinking abstractly about complicated questions as a way to expand one's mind/cognitive-like-sitch; it's the conclusion that I'm attacking here."

“""As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions"".
 Exactly, Stephen. And that would work extremely well as an inside joke too. Unless you are implying that, in contrast with the usual textbooks, 
Freakonomics
 actually uses science to pose those questions. In which case, and given the absolute lack of evidence, statistics and insight on any methodological tools here, I can’t help wondering: Science? What science? Where? GIVE ME ONE PAGE. The other unfortunate thing here is the 
“Revised and Expanded edition”
 issue, which can generally mean a number of things, but in the case of 
Freakonomics
 in specific, it was, as we know, the result of a huge wave of negative feedback from reviewers due to:a) the fact that the authors massively exaggerated some of their assumptions (because, obviously: when you think you’re using science when you really are not, that’s just bound to happen) and, as if this isn't enough already, the authors’ reliance on some quite noticeable mathematical monstrosities.b) The self-praise:“Hi. I’m Stephen J. Dubner. And I’m co-authoring this book. The other author is Steven D. Levitt and he’s such a genius, radical economist that we’re thinking we’ll stuff 
Freakonomics
 with tons of newspaper clippings on how awesome he is. And that’s gonna be all over the place. Yes! Oh, in case you’re wondering what a too-cool-for-school unconventional genius like Steven D. Levitt is doing writing books instead of just being a weird recluse in permanent scientific euphoria, worry not! He wasn't interested in writing anything, silly ones (as if)! Not unless it was with me, because, in case you haven’t figured it out already, I’m a kickarse, amazing journalist too! So please read us. Please. We’ll make you feel important and scientific”.So apparently they got the message and scrapped most of that out of the book, hence the 
“Revised and Expanded”
 edition.But honestly, when I found all that out, for a moment I thought I needed to double check that I was actually reading the revised thing.I was? Really? REALLY? WHAT WAS THE FIRST VERSION LIKE THEN?And it’s certainly not my fault that Nick Hornby has the answer to nearly everything. I don’t remember which issue of The Believer he wrote that in, but it was along the lines of:

 was a cool book and it made me feel smart. But what was it about?”Exactly, thank you.Two stars, because some of the questions they pose have interesting political and social implications, even though all questions are always posed through prose (with the use of loose logic at best) and absolutely not through the use of science.Oh.

It's been on my to-read list for a long time, and after finally got around to reading it, I came away disappointed. The book is mostly a disjointed series of unexpected pairings phrased as questions, like ""What do sumo wrestlers and real estate agents have in common?"" Most of the questions would never be anything an average person would ask or wonder about. The book was a haphazard compilation of these pairings and odd questions but, to be fair, the authors explicitly state that from the get-go. I found the sections on parenting and naming babies to be the most interesting, with the rest of it being on the dull side. Many of these questions felt artificially contrived to create a ""freaky"" spin on economics but it felt forced. That was my chief issue with the book - it felt like it was trying to hard to be edgy and hip, like a geeky kid who tries to impress by looking cool and winds up falling flat.I found Dan Arielly's book, Predictably Irrational to be much more entertaining with a smoother flow. Arielly's book deals with behavioral economics and delves into the reasons why people make the choices they do, some of which seem rational but aren't and others which seem irrational but aren't. Arielly's book left me with a greater insight into my own choices and the mechanisms at work behind them. Freakonomics left me with a general thought of ""Hmm, seemingly unrelated stuff is actually related and vice versa.""

But, alas, we ran out of time. We didn't make it to a bookstore. It was sadder than the last-minute loss of the cooler. So when we arrived in Chicago, and had a few minutes to wait for the connecting flight to Alaska, and our gate was right next to a book kiosk, and I was pretty sure there was just enough room in my carry-on to squeeze in one more book - it was this book that I grabbed. I raced through it. Loving each chapter. I really can't recommend it enough. A fun read, for those who like to be entertained by books. Informative too, for those that like to read for knowledge, thought, and/or discourse. But what elevates it to favorite is that it alters perception and challenges assumptions. For what it's worth, I have no regrets that I carried this book rather than Iowa pork.....and I can think of no finer testament to a good book. Then again, most of my entertainment these days revolves around pickling turnips. So if turnips aren't your thing, feel free to take my recommendation with a grain of salt....but you should still read this book."

DubnerFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything is the debut non-fiction book by University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and New York Times journalist Stephen J. Dubner. It was published on April 12, 2005, by William Morrow. The book has been described as melding pop culture with economics. By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide. The book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by ""traditional"" economists. In Freakonomics, Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of incentives. The book's chapters cover:Chapter 1: Discovering cheating as applied to teachers and sumo wrestlers, as well as a typical Washington, D.C.–area bagel business and its customersChapter 2: Information control as applied to the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agentsChapter 3: The economics of drug dealing, including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealersChapter 4: The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime, contrasted with the policies and downfall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled ""The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime,"" written with John Donohue.)Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good parenting on educationChapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children (nominative determinism)تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه آگوست سال 2008 میلادیعنوان: اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های پنهان اجتماعی؛ نویسنده: استیون لویت، استپان‌ دابنر؛ مترجم: سعید مشیری؛ تهران: نشر نی‏‫، 1386؛ در 269 ص؛ شابک: 9789643129507؛ چاپ دوم 1392؛ موضوع: اقتصاد از نویسندگان امریکایی - جنبه های روانشناسی - سده 21 معنوان: اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها؛ نویسنده: استیون دی‌. لویت؛ مترجم: امیرحسین توکلی؛ تهران: سبزان‏‫، 1385؛ در 197 ص؛ شابک: 9789648249674؛ عنوان روی جلد: اقتصاد علم انگیزه‌ها: مهارت‌های لازم برای کشف ابعاد پنهان پدیده‌ها؛‬کتاب «فریکونومیکس» در باره ی اقتصاد، از اقتصاددان دانشگاه شیکاگو «استیون لویت» است، که نخستین بار در روز دوازدهم ماه آوریل سال 2005 میلادی منتشر شد. این کتاب تا پایان سال 2009 میلادی، بیش از چهار میلیون نسخه فروش داشته است. کتاب با عنوان «اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های اجتماعی» توسط نشر نی و با ترجمه ی جناب «سعید مشیری»، و با عنوان: «اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها»؛ با ترجمه ی جناب «امیرحسین توکلی»، منتشر شده است. کتاب چندین فصل دارد: درباره حقه زدن در شغل‌هایی مانند معلمی و کشتی‌گیران سومو؛ شباهت‌های کوکلوس‌کلان‌ و افراد معاملات ملکی؛ سیستم اقتصادی کارتل‌های مواد مخدر؛ تاثیر قانونی‌سازی سقط جنین در کاهش جرایم چندین سال بعد؛ نقش بسیار کم تربیت خوب کودکان توسط والدین در بهتر شدن آموزش و پرورششان؛ و الگوهای نامگذاری کودکان در یک جامعه. ا. شربیانی"
277,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249257-elise,3,"Levitt makes the lofty claim that economics is not swayed by moral sensibilities - it's a pure numbers game of course! However, not knowing much about him beyond his affiliation with the University of Chicago and what was written in the book, I can surmise that he is conservative, or at least what today would be inappropriately labeled ""moderate."" Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily...or at least I don't view it that way. Does it affect his conclusions? Absolutely. Levitt assumes his assertion that Roe v. Wade is responsible for the drop in crime experienced in the 1990s is the most controversial in the book, but I was not bothered by that conclusion at all. What did raise my ire a bit was his statement that ""Minorities commit more crimes."" Perhaps the pure numbers seem to show so, but upon closer examination and more careful thought, one might conclude that minorities are simply arrested and convicted more often. In many cases, Levitt does delve into the deeper ""behind the scenes"" reasons for why things happen, but in this glaring example, he delves no further than to admit that poverty might have a link to crime commission, and with more minorities in poverty more of them commit crimes. Might it also have a link to crime conviction? The white suburban kid who can afford a long and arduous defense, or whose father knows someone who can get the kid out of a jam, has a much better chance of having his case dismissed than a poor minority kid assigned a public defender (not to say that public defenders don't do good work - in fact many of them are some of the most amazing lawyers out there). Suffice to say the system is stacked against people in poverty and minorities, and Levitt fails to fully acknowledge this in his discussion of what causes and helps prevent crime. I wasn't so much angry as I was disappointed. When one of the brightest minds in our country can't see beyond his own prejudices, where is the hope for the rest of us? Levitt might be a genius, but he is woefully culturally incompetent. "
278,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/847862-paulius,1,"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (2005)There are intriguing elements in this book but when it comes to the larger picture, I find it sorely lacking. Levitt is a young star in the economics profession who enjoys playing games with interesting questions. For example, he assembles data to demonstrate that Roe v. Wade was critical to the drop in the crime rate in the 90s. On p. 125 he notes ""So it wasn't capital punishment that drove crime down, nor was it the booming economy. But higher rates of imprisonment did have a lot to do with it."" Also, on p. 139, he says ""Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness, unwantedness leads to high crime, legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime."" He also addresses the old nature vs. nurture argument or environment vs. genetics when he says, on pp. 175-176, ""Parents who are well educated, successful, and healthy tend to have children who test well in school, but it doesn't seem to much matter whether a child is trotted off to museums or spanked or sent to Head Start....The reality is that technique looks to be highly overrated....adopted children test relatively poorly in school, any influence the adoptive parents might exert is seemingly outweighed by the force of genetics. But...the parents were not powerless forever. By the time the adopted children bacame adults, they had veered sharply from the destiny that IQ alone might have predicted. Compared to similar children who were not put up for adoption, the adoptees were far more likely to attend college, to have a well-paid job, and to wait until they were out of their teens before getting married."" Despite these insights, I would never want to write a book like this because it doesn't go after the betterment of the human condition in a broad sense in the fashion that Adam Smith tried with Wealth of Nations in 1776. Levitt may be rewarded for his fun puzzles by a best-seller, but does any of this really help society toward healthier, happier families in the future?"
279,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4047121-william-moore,1,"Freakonomics: a rogue economist – Is that all there is?The title of Freakonomics tells us that Steven Levitt is a “rogue economist” exploring the “the hidden side of everything.” I have always been up for a rogue telling me about everything. Even a rogue telling me about anything appeals to me; you know that special insight that only a mischievous, perhaps unprincipled, but somehow likeable person has. From the title I even conjured up some noble rogue elephant tearing apart the civilized world after suffering a loss of habitat. I was up for rogue. Economics, I thought, is a damn good place for a rogue.Levitt is an economics professor at the University of Chicago and a winner of the John Bates Clark Medal. That medal is awarded every two years to the best economist under 40. It is given by the American Economic Association. If you know anything about this Vanderbilt University supported organization, it wouldn’t be for their search for rogues (although they got Milton Friedman right in 1951.)Steven Levitt is best-known for his findings on America’s falling crime-rate during the 1990s. Teenage murder rates were predicted to double. Instead they fell by more than 50% in the space of five years. By 2000 they were at their lowest in 35 years. But why? Well, a lot of people were taking the credit. They were citing economic growth, gun control, policing, imprisonment and even the death penalty as the reason. Levitt proved the cause as Roe vs Wade, the Supreme Court decision that lead to the repeal of abortion laws in the US. His research showed that children born into impoverished environments were more likely to grow up to become criminals. His analysis formed the elegant but uncomfortable syllogism: “Unwantedness leads to high crime; abortion leads to less unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime.”Levitt is saying, according to Dubner, that incentives and motivations are intimately linked in driving human behaviour. No breakthrough – my mum knew that! He does come through with some interesting proofs. His ingenious methods of analysing data reveal sometimes startling conclusions: Chicago public school teachers were helping their students cheat on state exams; Sumo wrestlers were fixing some of their matches; real-estate agents don’t really care about how much they sell your house for – only their own house, and my favourite; dope-dealers rarely make a good living. These results do amuse, surprise and even educate. In all these conclusions there is a haunting. Strangely, within these intriguing anomalies we never find that superbly-skilled rogue practitioner of economics. Instead we are left with a peppy little repertoire of cocktail chatter (beer-chat for me) and little else.Something went wrong in the writing of Freakonomics. In the reading there was the echo of Mark Twain’s comment that golf was “a good walk spoiled.” Yes it is provocative and interesting but it has a problem. If Malcolm Gladwell of Tipping Point fame says “Steven Levitt has the most interesting mind in America . . .” then the problem is uncompromisingly simple – we can’t find Levitt or his mind in this book!Without question we can find – actually, we can’t get away from – the other Stephen, Stephen Dubner. He is Levitt’s coauthor and a contributor to the New York Times. Dubner occasionally genuflects to Levitt’s genius, to his unique insight, and treats us to the odd passing anecdote. For most of the book though he relies on the coattails of Levitt to spin his own story.Dubner just doesn’t get Levitt. A flaw, especially given the hype in the title. He tells us that this very special economist is challenging the established lens through which we see conventional economics. The problem is what is conventional is never argued and the nature of the difference is never revealed. This new lens, we are told, uncovers – no exposes – the patterns of conventional thinking. These come by way of conclusive moments, end points really, that are sometimes remarkably fascinating and clearly capture interest. The question is, are these moments, this shopping-list of results, the only point of the book?Although Steven Levitt is apparently (or even paradoxically) the coauthor, he never actually appears. Not only is he not there but his methodology is never fully presented nor explained. Malcolm Gladwell goes on to say “. . . and reading Freakonomics is like going for a leisurely walk with him on a sunny summer day, as he waves his fingers in the air and turns everything you once thought to be true inside out.” Well the problem is we never get to go on that walk with Steven Levitt. He just might be nearby, but you never know for sure.The book is a first-person telling by Dubner. So it leaves Dubner responsible for that walk. It also leaves him responsible for the non-telling of either process or personality. It is an issue of depth. His preamble, along with the very bad An Explanatory Note are ill-chosen attempts at building an arcane, deified and mystical Steven Levitt. When we get into the book, we think we are going to meet Levitt, this “rogue economist” – but we never do.Dubner continually misses the mark. He let a good book and a great opportunity slip away. This is because he thinks the mark is simply some captivating Levitt conclusion. Even though I found myself relishing some of these points and was more than willing to tell these little tidbits to my friends; they leave forever undone some important thinking.The success of the book is that each story is portable. In their portability there is a weakness. If the point is, each story is an indicator of how we can mis-see the world, then how do we understand mis-seeing or recognise mis-telling? The only way to know would be to understand Levitt, economics, and the processes by which we make conventional and sometimes remarkably wrong conclusions.We never do. Instead, in each story there is an echo of missed opportunity. In each he takes us on some short walk on how we might see the world. The trouble is it is only a short walk with no critical path to understand how we got there or just where we might be going.Dubner tells us early on that when the publisher approached Steven Levitt, Levitt didn’t want to write a book. He finally did agree to write it, but along with Dubner who had done a story about him for the Times. So Dubner and the brilliant Levitt agree to coauthor. Freakonomics is the result of that division of labour. Presumably Levitt’s job was to continue mining of the reality of the “hidden side of everything.” Then what was Stephen Dubner’s job? The answer: The weaver of these disparate stories; the interpreter; the pattern-finder – the writer! Unfortunately a substantive telling never happens. It takes about half the book to slowly realize Dubner doesn’t really get Levitt – and neither do we.In the end this book bizarrely peters off into some kind of parenting manual. This is presumably because Dubner and Levitt are young fathers. Who knows? Dubner then thinks he can put Humpty back together by saying in the Epilogue that there is “no unifying theme” in Freakonomics. Well he got that right! Here he is alluding to a quote by the philosopher Robert Nozick where Nozick said that at 26 Levitt didn’t need a “unifying theme” as an economist. This may be right for a young economist – but it is not necessarily true of a book.Dubner’s patchwork attempt at an ending only exacerbates the reality of missed opportunity. Unfortunately it causes Freakonomics to read a bit like: What my really important really smart friend did on his summer vacation.William Moore"

Something like ""freakostatistics"" would make much more sense as the name of the book.2. in the introduction, the writers warn us that correlation does not imply causality. OK, agreed. But the rest of the book is just that: THEY act as if correlation and causality are the same thing (but they just have more ""fun"" explanation for stuff). What exactly is their proof that they are not ""inventing explanations"" based on correlation, without any real evidence of causation?This book is just a pile of interesting nonsense.EDIT (2016): There is another thing in the authors' arguments that really bother me (besides the ""correlation vs causality"" debate). The authors' approach to economics is that economics is all about how incentives play out. While incentives are no doubt important in human behaviour, this is an extremely shallow way of talking about economics. It is also very consistent with ""unfettered free market"" ideology, which says that the best way to organize society is through profit incentive. This is a dangerous proposition (as we have seen in 2008) and scientifically very doubtful."

The worst part was definitely his sweeping assumptions and conclusions based on his oh-so-reliable data. He thinks he can get away with this because the preface of the book says that he doesn't come to any conclusions--just asking questions, but the writing SUGGESTS conclusions. Just look at the subtitle, ""the Hidden Side of Everything."" He manipulates the reader into thinking there are connections between things by placing the data and a possible explanation on the same page. The problem with those explanations is that there is no scientific approach. Most of his data are purely observational--which is inherently flawed when trying to find cause and effect. I think the book started off wrong when the so-called economist claimed that he didn't like calculus. I'm not sure how you can call yourself an economist without calculus... Maybe you can't... and maybe that's why this book doesn't work."

In true Chicago School style he pits unbridled laissez-faire at all and sundry in his whimsical little fashion. What we get is a truly melon-scratching mixture of sleight-of-hand and pop economics that revels in its eccentricity while being simultaneously superficial and misleading. Avoid. Avoid if you possibly can."
285,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17533257-jesse-lehrer,1,"The overarching point of this book is absolutely correct: conventional wisdom and what we perceive to be logical often is not. Our society is wrapped up and smothered in incorrect, dysfunctional assumptions that continue to rule our world and ruin our lives. Bigotry, ignorance, prejudice, fear, and the way people in power use these tools to divide and conquer us is at the root of all of our problems.That being said - everything else in this book is mediocre to bad. The writers make repeated assumptions and statements that are just flat out wrong. They make interesting points, and their comparisons are often thought provoking, but they could have used more of their own medicine.This book is clearly written by economists. Economics is one of the most useless, garbage ideologies ever created by humans. This is, of course, my opinion - but this book, I feel, only serves to prove that opinion. Over and over again the authors try to narrow down causes to one thing or another. They try to find the factor that changed everything. The abortion/crime essay is the clearest - abortion being legal is NOT the only factor that led to crime going down. There are thousands of factors that all contribute to everything that happens. Economists like to boil things down to numbers - instead of looking at people, looking at the complexity of life, they want a simple answer. There are no simple answers.In the book the authors do, occasionally, note that just one thing is not the cause - but they then go back on this again and again by making ridiculous statements, ie:""What sort of woman was most likely to take advantage of Roe v. Wade? Very often she was unmarried or in her teens or poor and sometimes all three."" This sentence gives the image of the typical woman getting an abortion to be a poor teenage girl. They don't say that's the majority, but the implication by choosing this example is that it's the norm. This is absolutely false - Planned Parenthood has plenty of information on this - the most common type of woman who gets an abortion is a woman who has already had a kid(s) and accidentally got pregnant and didn't want another kid. No stereotyping, no images of teenagers making bad choices, etc.Then there's this gem: ""Black Americans were hurt more by crack cocaine than by any other single cause since Jim Crow""I almost stopped reading the book there. That is so wrong, so offensive, so ignorant it is utterly ridiculous. There is NO SINGLE CAUSE of anything! This reductionist economist bullshit is exactly why I hate economics. And if there was a single cause - it wasn't fucking crack. It was racism, or structural racism, or criminalizing of young black people, or economic segregation, or reagonomics, or zoning laws, or re-districting, etc. etc. etc. Crack ruining black communities is, in actuality, a myth. Yes, it's a problem, yes, drug addiction in all forms is terrible, but this myth that crack just fell on black communities like a nuclear bomb leaving nothing behind but violence and death is just plain false. Additionally: the crackdown on drugs came BEFORE crack became an issue - it was a political device pre-dating crack used by Reagan to get votes from ignorant white people who feared black people. There are many books documenting this.In short: there are interesting points in this book, and the overall point is absolutely true. We all fall into believing bullshit that feels like it's obvious but is not. It's up to us individually, and as a society, to always seek the truth. However - the truth is not provided in a 20 page article as a single answer. If only the authors took their own ideas further the book might actually be worth something."
286,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830884-tony-viardo,1,"I was actually quite enthusiastic about reading this book, after having heard all the hype about it, and about Levitt.After I read it, however, I was greatly disappointed.This book is so overrated it's not just funny, it's baffling. To be honest, I really don't see how this author can be taken seriously. This book should be a farce to anyone who has any degree of skeptical thinking; any degree of respect for logic or empirical thought.Leavitt's conclusions are stretched like a rubber chicken (if not shot like one), his correlations are spurious at best, and his conclusions are no more insightful or incisive as what you would hear at a bull session with your friends, sitting around a bar, after knocking back a half dozen brews.Seriously, i really don't get all the hoopla that this title receives. Leavitt's only real talent seems to be collecting lists from public records sources, and then drawing the most asinine conclusions from them, and then writing them up with an ironic tone, just to sound smart. He seems to have accomplished a feat that would make PT Barnum proud... he thought up the most absurd conclusions, passed them off as expert observations, and then by sheer force of will got people to believe him. (You know the saying, ""the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it."")This tripe reminds of ""Who Moved My Cheese"" which was the biggest sham of a marketing snow job ever perpetrated in print, but was somehow widely hailed by business thinkers as a stroke of genius. This happened mainly because the first batch of readers, who got suckered into seriously reading it, didn't want to admit to everyone else that they got suckered into buying (for about 15 bucks) what amounted to bedtime story that any nanny could have come up with on the spot. So they proceeded to tell everyone they knew that the glorified pamphlet was actually wiser than the combined teachings of Confucious. Freakonomics should spend a whole chapter on that.The only real saving grace I found about the book is that I didn't pay full price for it. Ok, so now you know how I really feel about the book. Seriously, instead of buying this book, go spend your money on blue jeans, you're time will be better spent."

Which is a pity, as what it has to say is terribly interesting and amusing.The stuff at the end about how the name you are born with affects your life is very interesting. Also the idea, that is clearly true, but I'd never thought of it before, that people give their daughters crazier names than their sons.The point of this book is to say that sometimes there are very interesting correlations between things that seem quite disparate. The big one (and I haven't checked, but I assume this one didn't go down terribly well with the religious right in America) was the idea that the drop in violent crime in the US was due to the drop in violent criminals and this was due to there being less people brought up in abject poverty which is due to people being able to have access to abortion and not bringing unwanted children into the world.The comparisons between drug dealers and McDonalds as a corporate structure is now received wisdom - Obama quotes this in his book.Overall this is a great little read and quite fun - but really, I can't think of a single book that was improved by self-congratulation."

Maybe I'm stating it a little strongly, but it has been over two years since I read this book and I'm still angry about one of their premises. The authors proposed that crime rates went down due to the increase in abortions some 15 years earlier. Yes, they claim society is better off without the kids whose parents apparently didn't want them ever having a chance to grow up to be the miscreants they'd be destined to become. That may be a correlation but it is a huge stretch to claim it is a cause and effect. (The decreased crime rate is much better explained by Strauss & Howe in  Generations , by the way.)

Levitt is an expert number-cruncher, organizer, and researcher. The conclusions with which he attempts to wow the reader, however, are specious, hyperbolic, and generally lame-o-zoid.*Here's an example: The author explains a situation in which a parent will not permit their young child to go over to a friend's house because the child's friend's parents keep a gun in their home. The [first] parent, however, WILL allow their child to visit a DIFFERENT friend's house whose parents do NOT have a gun, but whose family has a swimming pool. The book then goes on to explain the statistics behind how many children die of gun deaths in this country in a given year versus how many children die in swimming pools in this country each year and determines that the [original] parent is not, according to the data, acting reasonably due to the fact that the likelihood of the child dying in a swimming pool far outweighs the likelihood of the child dying from a gun. Now, there's a reason why, when we talk about gun-safety, we don't talk about swimming pools. It's because swimming pools, if you'd believe it, don't have anything to do with gun safety.** In fact, that entire statistic-set, while an interesting mental exercise, is really no help to the parent. The statistic, were I a parent, that I would be interested in learning is something like: Out of all of the situations involving children dying from gun wounds in this country in a given year, how many of those instances took place when the child was visiting a friend's house? I don't know the answer to that, so, I'll just continue to be pleasantly outraged and move on to my next thought.This book, at its root, is arguing that the things we take for granted, like, belief-wise, might not only not be the case, but the actual truth of the matter(s) might be completely and utterly counter-intuitive to what we feel to be right. I think that's a great message and I wish this was simply a thinking-outside-the-box appreciation book. As a matter of fact, that's exactly what the [nearly two page] epilogue is arguing. With that in mind, I whole-heartedly recommend this book's epilogue. If, however, you're actually looking for a book to explain the hidden, counter-intuitive side to everything, like, for RIZZ, I'd recommend ""Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences"" by John Allen Paulos. BONUS THOUGHT: I should make it clear that I feel that the reason that ""Freakonomics"" is famous and ""Innumeracy"" is not famous, despite the fact that Mr. Paulos uses fewer pages to say more things more clearly, has to do with the fact that there is actual mathematics involved in the latter while the former just requires the reader to want to feel as though they're a smart person. FIN*But, some are for defs totes awes!**I certainly understand the value in thinking abstractly about complicated questions as a way to expand one's mind/cognitive-like-sitch; it's the conclusion that I'm attacking here."

“""As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions"".
 Exactly, Stephen. And that would work extremely well as an inside joke too. Unless you are implying that, in contrast with the usual textbooks, 
Freakonomics
 actually uses science to pose those questions. In which case, and given the absolute lack of evidence, statistics and insight on any methodological tools here, I can’t help wondering: Science? What science? Where? GIVE ME ONE PAGE. The other unfortunate thing here is the 
“Revised and Expanded edition”
 issue, which can generally mean a number of things, but in the case of 
Freakonomics
 in specific, it was, as we know, the result of a huge wave of negative feedback from reviewers due to:a) the fact that the authors massively exaggerated some of their assumptions (because, obviously: when you think you’re using science when you really are not, that’s just bound to happen) and, as if this isn't enough already, the authors’ reliance on some quite noticeable mathematical monstrosities.b) The self-praise:“Hi. I’m Stephen J. Dubner. And I’m co-authoring this book. The other author is Steven D. Levitt and he’s such a genius, radical economist that we’re thinking we’ll stuff 
Freakonomics
 with tons of newspaper clippings on how awesome he is. And that’s gonna be all over the place. Yes! Oh, in case you’re wondering what a too-cool-for-school unconventional genius like Steven D. Levitt is doing writing books instead of just being a weird recluse in permanent scientific euphoria, worry not! He wasn't interested in writing anything, silly ones (as if)! Not unless it was with me, because, in case you haven’t figured it out already, I’m a kickarse, amazing journalist too! So please read us. Please. We’ll make you feel important and scientific”.So apparently they got the message and scrapped most of that out of the book, hence the 
“Revised and Expanded”
 edition.But honestly, when I found all that out, for a moment I thought I needed to double check that I was actually reading the revised thing.I was? Really? REALLY? WHAT WAS THE FIRST VERSION LIKE THEN?And it’s certainly not my fault that Nick Hornby has the answer to nearly everything. I don’t remember which issue of The Believer he wrote that in, but it was along the lines of: 
""Freakonomics
 was a cool book and it made me feel smart. But what was it about?”Exactly, thank you.Two stars, because some of the questions they pose have interesting political and social implications, even though all questions are always posed through prose (with the use of loose logic at best) and absolutely not through the use of science.Oh. And the title is.. er.. misleading (Today I’m nice)."

It's been on my to-read list for a long time, and after finally got around to reading it, I came away disappointed. The book is mostly a disjointed series of unexpected pairings phrased as questions, like ""What do sumo wrestlers and real estate agents have in common?"" Most of the questions would never be anything an average person would ask or wonder about. The book was a haphazard compilation of these pairings and odd questions but, to be fair, the authors explicitly state that from the get-go. I found the sections on parenting and naming babies to be the most interesting, with the rest of it being on the dull side. Many of these questions felt artificially contrived to create a ""freaky"" spin on economics but it felt forced. That was my chief issue with the book - it felt like it was trying to hard to be edgy and hip, like a geeky kid who tries to impress by looking cool and winds up falling flat.I found Dan Arielly's book, Predictably Irrational to be much more entertaining with a smoother flow. Arielly's book deals with behavioral economics and delves into the reasons why people make the choices they do, some of which seem rational but aren't and others which seem irrational but aren't. Arielly's book left me with a greater insight into my own choices and the mechanisms at work behind them. Freakonomics left me with a general thought of ""Hmm, seemingly unrelated stuff is actually related and vice versa."" For anyone interested in behavior economics presented in a very accessible and entertaining manner, I would recommend Arielly's book over Freakonomics, hands down."

It's as if he just wrote out his thoughts as they were coming to him with no clear outline. I am very much in favor of people who get to the point, and there seems to be no point. Not only that, but he goes about making these correlations using his own data and methods of thinking. The idea that you have to look at unrelated factors to determine actual causes is great, but what about other causes he isn't presenting?

And I am thus indebted to such an extent, that I can confess to arriving early for any flight departing from an airport with a bookstore for the sole purpose of securing a few additional minutes to browse books. If it were not for the practicalities of travelling, I would probably have bought this book much sooner than I did for I had been securing extra minutes in airport bookstores just to read through another chapter long before I actually bought it.You see, my travels are laden with a heavy debate: shall I pack my extra suitcase with books or groceries? I resolve this by alternating. For one trip to the Outside, a spare duffel bag will be dedicated to books and I will shun all opportunities to visit grocery stores just to preserve that determination. On the next visit, I will carry a spare cooler (rather than duffel bag) and splurge on leg of lamb and cheeses free of artificial coloring. The ultimate effect of this system, however, is a backlog in possessing the books I'd like to read.Finally, however, the fates aligned. I was travelling to Iowa on what I expected to be a gloriously grocery-focused trip. But my cooler broke as I was carrying it to the truck that we would drive to our local airport. There wasn't time to fix it. I was sad, of course, as I had been anticipating all the pork I was going to return with from Iowa. But I consoled myself with all those Iowa cookbooks I could now carry, and resolved not to prolong any lamentations over the cooler. And, oh, did I find myself lugging around a heavy library - such hours did I spend in Powells (there was a 1 week layover in Oregon) and Iowa City's bookstores. The day before we left Iowa, Nate told me about how much he enjoyed this book. His description renewed my interest, and I committed myself to buying a copy before we left. But, alas, we ran out of time. We didn't make it to a bookstore. It was sadder than the last-minute loss of the cooler. So when we arrived in Chicago, and had a few minutes to wait for the connecting flight to Alaska, and our gate was right next to a book kiosk, and I was pretty sure there was just enough room in my carry-on to squeeze in one more book - it was this book that I grabbed. I raced through it. Loving each chapter. I really can't recommend it enough. A fun read, for those who like to be entertained by books. Informative too, for those that like to read for knowledge, thought, and/or discourse. But what elevates it to favorite is that it alters perception and challenges assumptions. For what it's worth, I have no regrets that I carried this book rather than Iowa pork.....and I can think of no finer testament to a good book. Then again, most of my entertainment these days revolves around pickling turnips. So if turnips aren't your thing, feel free to take my recommendation with a grain of salt....but you should still read this book."

DubnerFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything is the debut non-fiction book by University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and New York Times journalist Stephen J. Dubner. It was published on April 12, 2005, by William Morrow. The book has been described as melding pop culture with economics. By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide. The book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by ""traditional"" economists. In Freakonomics, Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of incentives. The book's chapters cover:Chapter 1: Discovering cheating as applied to teachers and sumo wrestlers, as well as a typical Washington, D.C.–area bagel business and its customersChapter 2: Information control as applied to the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agentsChapter 3: The economics of drug dealing, including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealersChapter 4: The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime, contrasted with the policies and downfall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled ""The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime,"" written with John Donohue.)Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good parenting on educationChapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children (nominative determinism)تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه آگوست سال 2008 میلادیعنوان: اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های پنهان اجتماعی؛ نویسنده: استیون لویت، استپان‌ دابنر؛ مترجم: سعید مشیری؛ تهران: نشر نی‏‫، 1386؛ در 269 ص؛ شابک: 9789643129507؛ چاپ دوم 1392؛ موضوع: اقتصاد از نویسندگان امریکایی - جنبه های روانشناسی - سده 21 معنوان: اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها؛ نویسنده: استیون دی‌. لویت؛ مترجم: امیرحسین توکلی؛ تهران: سبزان‏‫، 1385؛ در 197 ص؛ شابک: 9789648249674؛ عنوان روی جلد: اقتصاد علم انگیزه‌ها: مهارت‌های لازم برای کشف ابعاد پنهان پدیده‌ها؛‬کتاب «فریکونومیکس» در باره ی اقتصاد، از اقتصاددان دانشگاه شیکاگو «استیون لویت» است، که نخستین بار در روز دوازدهم ماه آوریل سال 2005 میلادی منتشر شد. این کتاب تا پایان سال 2009 میلادی، بیش از چهار میلیون نسخه فروش داشته است. کتاب با عنوان «اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های اجتماعی» توسط نشر نی و با ترجمه ی جناب «سعید مشیری»، و با عنوان: «اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها»؛ با ترجمه ی جناب «امیرحسین توکلی»، منتشر شده است. کتاب چندین فصل دارد: درباره حقه زدن در شغل‌هایی مانند معلمی و کشتی‌گیران سومو؛ شباهت‌های کوکلوس‌کلان‌ و افراد معاملات ملکی؛ سیستم اقتصادی کارتل‌های مواد مخدر؛ تاثیر قانونی‌سازی سقط جنین در کاهش جرایم چندین سال بعد؛ نقش بسیار کم تربیت خوب کودکان توسط والدین در بهتر شدن آموزش و پرورششان؛ و الگوهای نامگذاری کودکان در یک جامعه. ا. شربیانی"
307,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249257-elise,3,"Levitt makes the lofty claim that economics is not swayed by moral sensibilities - it's a pure numbers game of course! However, not knowing much about him beyond his affiliation with the University of Chicago and what was written in the book, I can surmise that he is conservative, or at least what today would be inappropriately labeled ""moderate."" Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily...or at least I don't view it that way. Does it affect his conclusions? Absolutely. Levitt assumes his assertion that Roe v. Wade is responsible for the drop in crime experienced in the 1990s is the most controversial in the book, but I was not bothered by that conclusion at all. What did raise my ire a bit was his statement that ""Minorities commit more crimes."" Perhaps the pure numbers seem to show so, but upon closer examination and more careful thought, one might conclude that minorities are simply arrested and convicted more often. In many cases, Levitt does delve into the deeper ""behind the scenes"" reasons for why things happen, but in this glaring example, he delves no further than to admit that poverty might have a link to crime commission, and with more minorities in poverty more of them commit crimes. Might it also have a link to crime conviction? The white suburban kid who can afford a long and arduous defense, or whose father knows someone who can get the kid out of a jam, has a much better chance of having his case dismissed than a poor minority kid assigned a public defender (not to say that public defenders don't do good work - in fact many of them are some of the most amazing lawyers out there). Suffice to say the system is stacked against people in poverty and minorities, and Levitt fails to fully acknowledge this in his discussion of what causes and helps prevent crime. I wasn't so much angry as I was disappointed. When one of the brightest minds in our country can't see beyond his own prejudices, where is the hope for the rest of us? Levitt might be a genius, but he is woefully culturally incompetent. "
308,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/847862-paulius,1,"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (2005)There are intriguing elements in this book but when it comes to the larger picture, I find it sorely lacking. Levitt is a young star in the economics profession who enjoys playing games with interesting questions. For example, he assembles data to demonstrate that Roe v. Wade was critical to the drop in the crime rate in the 90s. On p. 125 he notes ""So it wasn't capital punishment that drove crime down, nor was it the booming economy. But higher rates of imprisonment did have a lot to do with it."" Also, on p. 139, he says ""Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness, unwantedness leads to high crime, legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime."" He also addresses the old nature vs. nurture argument or environment vs. genetics when he says, on pp. 175-176, ""Parents who are well educated, successful, and healthy tend to have children who test well in school, but it doesn't seem to much matter whether a child is trotted off to museums or spanked or sent to Head Start....The reality is that technique looks to be highly overrated....adopted children test relatively poorly in school, any influence the adoptive parents might exert is seemingly outweighed by the force of genetics. But...the parents were not powerless forever. By the time the adopted children bacame adults, they had veered sharply from the destiny that IQ alone might have predicted. Compared to similar children who were not put up for adoption, the adoptees were far more likely to attend college, to have a well-paid job, and to wait until they were out of their teens before getting married."" Despite these insights, I would never want to write a book like this because it doesn't go after the betterment of the human condition in a broad sense in the fashion that Adam Smith tried with Wealth of Nations in 1776. Levitt may be rewarded for his fun puzzles by a best-seller, but does any of this really help society toward healthier, happier families in the future?"
309,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4047121-william-moore,1,"Freakonomics: a rogue economist – Is that all there is?The title of Freakonomics tells us that Steven Levitt is a “rogue economist” exploring the “the hidden side of everything.” I have always been up for a rogue telling me about everything. Even a rogue telling me about anything appeals to me; you know that special insight that only a mischievous, perhaps unprincipled, but somehow likeable person has. From the title I even conjured up some noble rogue elephant tearing apart the civilized world after suffering a loss of habitat. I was up for rogue. Economics, I thought, is a damn good place for a rogue.Levitt is an economics professor at the University of Chicago and a winner of the John Bates Clark Medal. That medal is awarded every two years to the best economist under 40. It is given by the American Economic Association. If you know anything about this Vanderbilt University supported organization, it wouldn’t be for their search for rogues (although they got Milton Friedman right in 1951.)Steven Levitt is best-known for his findings on America’s falling crime-rate during the 1990s. Teenage murder rates were predicted to double. Instead they fell by more than 50% in the space of five years. By 2000 they were at their lowest in 35 years. But why? Well, a lot of people were taking the credit. They were citing economic growth, gun control, policing, imprisonment and even the death penalty as the reason. Levitt proved the cause as Roe vs Wade, the Supreme Court decision that lead to the repeal of abortion laws in the US. His research showed that children born into impoverished environments were more likely to grow up to become criminals. His analysis formed the elegant but uncomfortable syllogism: “Unwantedness leads to high crime; abortion leads to less unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime.”Levitt is saying, according to Dubner, that incentives and motivations are intimately linked in driving human behaviour. No breakthrough – my mum knew that! He does come through with some interesting proofs. His ingenious methods of analysing data reveal sometimes startling conclusions: Chicago public school teachers were helping their students cheat on state exams; Sumo wrestlers were fixing some of their matches; real-estate agents don’t really care about how much they sell your house for – only their own house, and my favourite; dope-dealers rarely make a good living. These results do amuse, surprise and even educate. In all these conclusions there is a haunting. Strangely, within these intriguing anomalies we never find that superbly-skilled rogue practitioner of economics. Instead we are left with a peppy little repertoire of cocktail chatter (beer-chat for me) and little else.Something went wrong in the writing of Freakonomics. In the reading there was the echo of Mark Twain’s comment that golf was “a good walk spoiled.” Yes it is provocative and interesting but it has a problem. If Malcolm Gladwell of Tipping Point fame says “Steven Levitt has the most interesting mind in America . . .” then the problem is uncompromisingly simple – we can’t find Levitt or his mind in this book!Without question we can find – actually, we can’t get away from – the other Stephen, Stephen Dubner. He is Levitt’s coauthor and a contributor to the New York Times. Dubner occasionally genuflects to Levitt’s genius, to his unique insight, and treats us to the odd passing anecdote. For most of the book though he relies on the coattails of Levitt to spin his own story.Dubner just doesn’t get Levitt. A flaw, especially given the hype in the title. He tells us that this very special economist is challenging the established lens through which we see conventional economics. The problem is what is conventional is never argued and the nature of the difference is never revealed. This new lens, we are told, uncovers – no exposes – the patterns of conventional thinking. These come by way of conclusive moments, end points really, that are sometimes remarkably fascinating and clearly capture interest. The question is, are these moments, this shopping-list of results, the only point of the book?Although Steven Levitt is apparently (or even paradoxically) the coauthor, he never actually appears. Not only is he not there but his methodology is never fully presented nor explained. Malcolm Gladwell goes on to say “. . . and reading Freakonomics is like going for a leisurely walk with him on a sunny summer day, as he waves his fingers in the air and turns everything you once thought to be true inside out.” Well the problem is we never get to go on that walk with Steven Levitt. He just might be nearby, but you never know for sure.The book is a first-person telling by Dubner. So it leaves Dubner responsible for that walk. It also leaves him responsible for the non-telling of either process or personality. It is an issue of depth. His preamble, along with the very bad An Explanatory Note are ill-chosen attempts at building an arcane, deified and mystical Steven Levitt. When we get into the book, we think we are going to meet Levitt, this “rogue economist” – but we never do.Dubner continually misses the mark. He let a good book and a great opportunity slip away. This is because he thinks the mark is simply some captivating Levitt conclusion. Even though I found myself relishing some of these points and was more than willing to tell these little tidbits to my friends; they leave forever undone some important thinking.The success of the book is that each story is portable. In their portability there is a weakness. If the point is, each story is an indicator of how we can mis-see the world, then how do we understand mis-seeing or recognise mis-telling? The only way to know would be to understand Levitt, economics, and the processes by which we make conventional and sometimes remarkably wrong conclusions.We never do. Instead, in each story there is an echo of missed opportunity. In each he takes us on some short walk on how we might see the world. The trouble is it is only a short walk with no critical path to understand how we got there or just where we might be going.Dubner tells us early on that when the publisher approached Steven Levitt, Levitt didn’t want to write a book. He finally did agree to write it, but along with Dubner who had done a story about him for the Times. So Dubner and the brilliant Levitt agree to coauthor. Freakonomics is the result of that division of labour. Presumably Levitt’s job was to continue mining of the reality of the “hidden side of everything.” Then what was Stephen Dubner’s job? The answer: The weaver of these disparate stories; the interpreter; the pattern-finder – the writer! Unfortunately a substantive telling never happens. It takes about half the book to slowly realize Dubner doesn’t really get Levitt – and neither do we.In the end this book bizarrely peters off into some kind of parenting manual. This is presumably because Dubner and Levitt are young fathers. Who knows? Dubner then thinks he can put Humpty back together by saying in the Epilogue that there is “no unifying theme” in Freakonomics. Well he got that right! Here he is alluding to a quote by the philosopher Robert Nozick where Nozick said that at 26 Levitt didn’t need a “unifying theme” as an economist. This may be right for a young economist – but it is not necessarily true of a book.Dubner’s patchwork attempt at an ending only exacerbates the reality of missed opportunity. Unfortunately it causes Freakonomics to read a bit like: What my really important really smart friend did on his summer vacation.William Moore"

What exactly is their proof that they are not ""inventing explanations"" based on correlation, without any real evidence of causation?This book is just a pile of interesting nonsense.EDIT (2016): There is another thing in the authors' arguments that really bother me (besides the ""correlation vs causality"" debate). The authors' approach to economics is that economics is all about how incentives play out. While incentives are no doubt important in human behaviour, this is an extremely shallow way of talking about economics. It is also very consistent with ""unfettered free market"" ideology, which says that the best way to organize society is through profit incentive.

Just look at the subtitle, ""the Hidden Side of Everything."" He manipulates the reader into thinking there are connections between things by placing the data and a possible explanation on the same page. The problem with those explanations is that there is no scientific approach. Most of his data are purely observational--which is inherently flawed when trying to find cause and effect.

Economics is one of the most useless, garbage ideologies ever created by humans. This is, of course, my opinion - but this book, I feel, only serves to prove that opinion. Over and over again the authors try to narrow down causes to one thing or another. They try to find the factor that changed everything. The abortion/crime essay is the clearest - abortion being legal is NOT the only factor that led to crime going down. There are thousands of factors that all contribute to everything that happens. Economists like to boil things down to numbers - instead of looking at people, looking at the complexity of life, they want a simple answer. There are no simple answers.In the book the authors do, occasionally, note that just one thing is not the cause - but they then go back on this again and again by making ridiculous statements, ie:""What sort of woman was most likely to take advantage of Roe v. Wade? Very often she was unmarried or in her teens or poor and sometimes all three."" This sentence gives the image of the typical woman getting an abortion to be a poor teenage girl. They don't say that's the majority, but the implication by choosing this example is that it's the norm. This is absolutely false - Planned Parenthood has plenty of information on this - the most common type of woman who gets an abortion is a woman who has already had a kid(s) and accidentally got pregnant and didn't want another kid. No stereotyping, no images of teenagers making bad choices, etc.Then there's this gem: ""Black Americans were hurt more by crack cocaine than by any other single cause since Jim Crow""I almost stopped reading the book there. That is so wrong, so offensive, so ignorant it is utterly ridiculous. There is NO SINGLE CAUSE of anything! This reductionist economist bullshit is exactly why I hate economics. And if there was a single cause - it wasn't fucking crack. It was racism, or structural racism, or criminalizing of young black people, or economic segregation, or reagonomics, or zoning laws, or re-districting, etc. etc. etc. Crack ruining black communities is, in actuality, a myth. Yes, it's a problem, yes, drug addiction in all forms is terrible, but this myth that crack just fell on black communities like a nuclear bomb leaving nothing behind but violence and death is just plain false. Additionally: the crackdown on drugs came BEFORE crack became an issue - it was a political device pre-dating crack used by Reagan to get votes from ignorant white people who feared black people. There are many books documenting this.In short: there are interesting points in this book, and the overall point is absolutely true. We all fall into believing bullshit that feels like it's obvious but is not. It's up to us individually, and as a society, to always seek the truth. However - the truth is not provided in a 20 page article as a single answer. If only the authors took their own ideas further the book might actually be worth something."

To be honest, I really don't see how this author can be taken seriously. This book should be a farce to anyone who has any degree of skeptical thinking; any degree of respect for logic or empirical thought.Leavitt's conclusions are stretched like a rubber chicken (if not shot like one), his correlations are spurious at best, and his conclusions are no more insightful or incisive as what you would hear at a bull session with your friends, sitting around a bar, after knocking back a half dozen brews.Seriously, i really don't get all the hoopla that this title receives. Leavitt's only real talent seems to be collecting lists from public records sources, and then drawing the most asinine conclusions from them, and then writing them up with an ironic tone, just to sound smart. He seems to have accomplished a feat that would make PT Barnum proud... he thought up the most absurd conclusions, passed them off as expert observations, and then by sheer force of will got people to believe him. (You know the saying, ""the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it."")This tripe reminds of ""Who Moved My Cheese"" which was the biggest sham of a marketing snow job ever perpetrated in print, but was somehow widely hailed by business thinkers as a stroke of genius. This happened mainly because the first batch of readers, who got suckered into seriously reading it, didn't want to admit to everyone else that they got suckered into buying (for about 15 bucks) what amounted to bedtime story that any nanny could have come up with on the spot. So they proceeded to tell everyone they knew that the glorified pamphlet was actually wiser than the combined teachings of Confucious. Freakonomics should spend a whole chapter on that.The only real saving grace I found about the book is that I didn't pay full price for it. Ok, so now you know how I really feel about the book. Seriously, instead of buying this book, go spend your money on blue jeans, you're time will be better spent."

Which is a pity, as what it has to say is terribly interesting and amusing.The stuff at the end about how the name you are born with affects your life is very interesting. Also the idea, that is clearly true, but I'd never thought of it before, that people give their daughters crazier names than their sons.The point of this book is to say that sometimes there are very interesting correlations between things that seem quite disparate. The big one (and I haven't checked, but I assume this one didn't go down terribly well with the religious right in America) was the idea that the drop in violent crime in the US was due to the drop in violent criminals and this was due to there being less people brought up in abject poverty which is due to people being able to have access to abortion and not bringing unwanted children into the world.The comparisons between drug dealers and McDonalds as a corporate structure is now received wisdom - Obama quotes this in his book.Overall this is a great little read and quite fun - but really, I can't think of a single book that was improved by self-congratulation."

Maybe I'm stating it a little strongly, but it has been over two years since I read this book and I'm still angry about one of their premises. The authors proposed that crime rates went down due to the increase in abortions some 15 years earlier. Yes, they claim society is better off without the kids whose parents apparently didn't want them ever having a chance to grow up to be the miscreants they'd be destined to become. That may be a correlation but it is a huge stretch to claim it is a cause and effect. (The decreased crime rate is much better explained by Strauss & Howe in  Generations , by the way.)

If pressed, I'd assign this book to a category I'd call ""Books That People Who Love Malcolm Gladwell Might Also Enjoy."" There's no doubt that Steven D. Levitt is an expert number-cruncher, organizer, and researcher. The conclusions with which he attempts to wow the reader, however, are specious, hyperbolic, and generally lame-o-zoid.*Here's an example: The author explains a situation in which a parent will not permit their young child to go over to a friend's house because the child's friend's parents keep a gun in their home. The [first] parent, however, WILL allow their child to visit a DIFFERENT friend's house whose parents do NOT have a gun, but whose family has a swimming pool. The book then goes on to explain the statistics behind how many children die of gun deaths in this country in a given year versus how many children die in swimming pools in this country each year and determines that the [original] parent is not, according to the data, acting reasonably due to the fact that the likelihood of the child dying in a swimming pool far outweighs the likelihood of the child dying from a gun. Now, there's a reason why, when we talk about gun-safety, we don't talk about swimming pools. It's because swimming pools, if you'd believe it, don't have anything to do with gun safety.** In fact, that entire statistic-set, while an interesting mental exercise, is really no help to the parent. The statistic, were I a parent, that I would be interested in learning is something like: Out of all of the situations involving children dying from gun wounds in this country in a given year, how many of those instances took place when the child was visiting a friend's house? I don't know the answer to that, so, I'll just continue to be pleasantly outraged and move on to my next thought.This book, at its root, is arguing that the things we take for granted, like, belief-wise, might not only not be the case, but the actual truth of the matter(s) might be completely and utterly counter-intuitive to what we feel to be right. I think that's a great message and I wish this was simply a thinking-outside-the-box appreciation book. As a matter of fact, that's exactly what the [nearly two page] epilogue is arguing. With that in mind, I whole-heartedly recommend this book's epilogue. If, however, you're actually looking for a book to explain the hidden, counter-intuitive side to everything, like, for RIZZ, I'd recommend ""Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences"" by John Allen Paulos. BONUS THOUGHT: I should make it clear that I feel that the reason that ""Freakonomics"" is famous and ""Innumeracy"" is not famous, despite the fact that Mr. Paulos uses fewer pages to say more things more clearly, has to do with the fact that there is actual mathematics involved in the latter while the former just requires the reader to want to feel as though they're a smart person. FIN*But, some are for defs totes awes!**I certainly understand the value in thinking abstractly about complicated questions as a way to expand one's mind/cognitive-like-sitch; it's the conclusion that I'm attacking here."
328,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18423957-eleni,2,"For a book that so heavily relies on (mostly) untested assumptions, the repeated, passionate references to the distinction between causality and correlation is impressive if not audacious, to say the least. Suffice to say, 
“""As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions"".
 Exactly, Stephen. And that would work extremely well as an inside joke too. Unless you are implying that, in contrast with the usual textbooks, 
Freakonomics
 actually uses science to pose those questions. In which case, and given the absolute lack of evidence, statistics and insight on any methodological tools here, I can’t help wondering: Science? What science? Where? GIVE ME ONE PAGE. The other unfortunate thing here is the 
“Revised and Expanded edition”
 issue, which can generally mean a number of things, but in the case of 
Freakonomics
 in specific, it was, as we know, the result of a huge wave of negative feedback from reviewers due to:a) the fact that the authors massively exaggerated some of their assumptions (because, obviously: when you think you’re using science when you really are not, that’s just bound to happen) and, as if this isn't enough already, the authors’ reliance on some quite noticeable mathematical monstrosities.b) The self-praise:“Hi. I’m Stephen J. Dubner. And I’m co-authoring this book. The other author is Steven D. Levitt and he’s such a genius, radical economist that we’re thinking we’ll stuff 
Freakonomics
 with tons of newspaper clippings on how awesome he is. And that’s gonna be all over the place. Yes! Oh, in case you’re wondering what a too-cool-for-school unconventional genius like Steven D. Levitt is doing writing books instead of just being a weird recluse in permanent scientific euphoria, worry not! He wasn't interested in writing anything, silly ones (as if)! Not unless it was with me, because, in case you haven’t figured it out already, I’m a kickarse, amazing journalist too! So please read us. Please. We’ll make you feel important and scientific”.So apparently they got the message and scrapped most of that out of the book, hence the 
“Revised and Expanded”
 edition.But honestly, when I found all that out, for a moment I thought I needed to double check that I was actually reading the revised thing.I was? Really? REALLY? WHAT WAS THE FIRST VERSION LIKE THEN?And it’s certainly not my fault that Nick Hornby has the answer to nearly everything. I don’t remember which issue of The Believer he wrote that in, but it was along the lines of: 
""Freakonomics
 was a cool book and it made me feel smart. But what was it about?”Exactly, thank you.Two stars, because some of the questions they pose have interesting political and social implications, even though all questions are always posed through prose (with the use of loose logic at best) and absolutely not through the use of science.Oh. And the title is.. er.. misleading (Today I’m nice)."
329,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1336988-wendy,2,"I had high expectations for this book based on all of the hype. It's been on my to-read list for a long time, and after finally got around to reading it, I came away disappointed. The book is mostly a disjointed series of unexpected pairings phrased as questions, like ""What do sumo wrestlers and real estate agents have in common?"" Most of the questions would never be anything an average person would ask or wonder about. The book was a haphazard compilation of these pairings and odd questions but, to be fair, the authors explicitly state that from the get-go. I found the sections on parenting and naming babies to be the most interesting, with the rest of it being on the dull side. Many of these questions felt artificially contrived to create a ""freaky"" spin on economics but it felt forced. That was my chief issue with the book - it felt like it was trying to hard to be edgy and hip, like a geeky kid who tries to impress by looking cool and winds up falling flat.I found Dan Arielly's book, Predictably Irrational to be much more entertaining with a smoother flow. Arielly's book deals with behavioral economics and delves into the reasons why people make the choices they do, some of which seem rational but aren't and others which seem irrational but aren't. Arielly's book left me with a greater insight into my own choices and the mechanisms at work behind them. Freakonomics left me with a general thought of ""Hmm, seemingly unrelated stuff is actually related and vice versa."" For anyone interested in behavior economics presented in a very accessible and entertaining manner, I would recommend Arielly's book over Freakonomics, hands down."

333,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,3,"I once read somewhere that statistics can be used to prove anything. This book is evidence for the same.Steven D. Levitt, a ""rogue"" economist by his own admission, and who confesses that he is terrible at traditional economics, uses the methods of statistical analysis to look at the unexplored relations between things in society - like the resemblance between Japanese sumo wrestlers and American schoolteachers, why real-estate agents are similar to the Ku Klux Klan, whether parenting has any effect on how a child turns out... etc, etc. By the confession of the authors themselves, the book has no central theme - it just explores the ""hidden side of everything"". Levitt and Dubner say that economics has the tools to provide the right answers, but only a very few people ask the right questions.Some of his findings do have credibility (like that of schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers cheating to advance their careers, though I did not find anything earthshaking in those); some seem to be refreshing new perspectives (the similarity between the drug mafia and corporate houses, for example); some seem trite to the point of silliness (like the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agents being undone through the availability of information); and some seem to have some substance, but require further study of all parameters (how the station in life and the behaviour of parents affect the children). However, One finding, which is lauded by most reviewers of the book as startling, I found I could take with only a very large lump of salt: that the reduction in crime in the USA in the 1990's is due to the legalisation of abortions in 1973. The authors assume that crime is committed by unwanted children whom their mothers could not get rid of, and once they were allowed to, problem was solved! This, while at the same time arguing gun control is not having much effect either way while increase in police force and punishment is a deterrent, seems to me peddling to the right liberal narrative - at the same time totally ignoring the socioeconomic factors behind crime.As far as I am concerned, any kind of simplistic conclusions drawn from statistical data is suspect. Let me make this clear with an example close to my heart.In India, the state of Kerala in the south (from where I hail) tops in almost all Human Development Indices (HDI) such as health, education etc. However, the state also has the highest morbidity levels. What does this mean? Whether higher levels of general health leads to higher incidence of life-style diseases, or simply that since the healthcare and education are good, more people see doctors? Similarly, Kerala is fourth in India on the basis of reported crime. Does this mean that a higher level of education increases criminal tendencies, or that with a more aware population, more crimes get reported? Heated arguments take place on these questions regularly with no clear conclusions - because there are too many factors to make clear inferences.So does that mean Levitt and Dubner are talking through their hat, and are best ignored? No, in my opinion. This book is worth reading, if only for the unusual perspective. Also, it prompts us to think beyond the glib statistics the ""experts"" spout to intimidate the poor layperson, and see for ourselves."

347,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9832722-j,1,"About halfway through Freakonomics, and here's the summary thus far:* We are all liars (excepting the authors, apparently).* We are all cheaters (a few of the examples provided: sumo wrestlers; teachers; real estate agents; and pretty much everyone who owns, operates, or works in for-profit business).* We are all bigots (as demonstrated by intensive game show analysis).In fact, most every person is simply horrible. Except for crack dealers. Those guys are just misunderstood by the society that handed them a raw deal from birth.For the uninitiated, this New York Times bestseller (more than three million copies sold) details a lone, prodigious economist's meticulous examinations of some of society's “freaky” questions—debunking conventional wisdom using hard data gathered through deep and unconventional mining, or so the claim goes.Sadly, the book completely ignores its own correlation/causation warning and goes straight for the x-proves-y jugular—not infrequently, but with numerous instances per chapter, if not per page. Here's a simple (and comparatively less offensive) example from today's reading, included in an analysis of online dating:28% of the women on the site said they were blonde, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dying, or lying, or both.The assumptions behind such a statement are noteworthy. Must this conclusion follow from the data? No. The authors assume that those who use online dating sites mirror the population at large. What data do they offer to prove this is the case? None. So, how about some alternative hypotheses:* Older adults are greatly underrepresented on the Internet, compared to other age groups. Even considering those who do get online, how many 70-year-old women are posting profiles on match.com? Eliminating most of the grey-haired, white haired, salt-and-pepper haired, and bald women might alter the percentages, no?* Minority ethnicities are likewise underrepresented online. Many minorities who populate the United States (e.g., blacks, Hispanics, Middle Easterners, Asians) are genetically predisposed to having dark hair. How might this fact alter the odds?* For the sake of argument, let's assume blondness to be a characteristic that increases a woman's comparative physical attractiveness. Might it be reasonable that many such attractive women have become distressed by the type of man who hits on them in, say, a club? It's certainly quite possible that such men, who are likely searching for yet another sexual partner and nothing more, would be keenly interested in physical attractiveness. We could reasonably infer that most of the interactions such women have with men are primarily sexual in nature and, depending on her ultimate aims, much less desirable. How about those attractive women who claim they never get dates, because men are too intimidated to ask them out? What are the prospects of a successful long-term relationship for these women? A dating site sounds like a reasonable alternative to me.* Along those same lines, research has found that attractiveness positively correlates with income (i.e., attractive people tend to make more money). Aren't those with money more likely to (a) own a computer, (b) have the disposable income needed to purchase monthly Internet access and subscriptions to such dating sites, and/or (c) be busy enough with work as to make dating a more complicated enterprise—one demographic explicitly targeted by such web sites?* And my favorite, from a philosophical standpoint: what, precisely, defines blondness? One might say that blondness is defined by the having of blonde hair. By this criteria, does it matter if such hair color is natural or achieved by alternate methods (i.e., dying)? Might it not be that 28% of women actually are blonde, if we throw all those who dye their hair into a group with the natural blondes? After all, is the online dating web site's prompt ""hair color"" or ""natural hair color?""And these are just top-of-the-head scenarios offered by a regular guy with very little research background or statistical training. They all seem like reasonable questions to me—questions that should be explored before making such broad assertions.

I realize that statistics can be made to show anything you want them to, but Levitt spends so much time implying that other people are doing this but he isn't is laughable.I am so glad I got this book from the library and that I didn't buy it, what a waste of money that would have been."

354,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,4,"An engaging read but not necessarily the scintillating, mind-blowing experience it had been hyped as.Levitt and Dubner present their arguments well and their style makes the at-times daunting subject matter easier to approach and thus easier to digest. I don't read much non-fiction (for example) and even less stuff about economics but I found this book quick to get through and I was able to take away their message without having to labor through it.That said, a few points:(1) They make some outrageous claims. To their credit, these claims appear to be backed up by the data. Their rhetoric is frequently hyperbolic though. At times it takes some patience to get the point of a given chapter. The arc tends to go like this: outrageous claim > brief discussion of that claim > discussion of parallel claim > presentation of data > analysis of data > tie them together > see if you can tear down the argument via convention wisdom > oops, conventional wisdom falls under scrutiny of the data. That said, the style makes it easy to break chapters up into small read-it-on-the-can chunks; if you read it that way, prepare to bite your tongue on any given objection until you have finished.(2) In light of #1: Levitt keeps mentioning that he's not much of an economist and even poorer with his math. But there's a lot of math in here. (Presented in a friendly, non-mathematical sort of way, but math nonetheless.) So... Is he just putting us on? Or (as A. would say) is it that ""stats"" aren't ""math""?(3) Also in light of #1: I would like to have seen more of the data. We get a lot of ""xx% decrease"" and ""such-and-such quadrupled"" but the figures themselves are obfuscated. There is an extensive appendix of notes at the end of the book which references specific articles; I'm assuming the ""hard numbers"" are in those articles. But my own background (i.e., bio-psych research papers) biases me to expect a more explicit presentation of those data. So that was disappointing.(4) Levitt & Dubner allege at the beginning of the book that there is no unifying theme. That's more/less crap. The unifying theme seems to be: here are some microeconomics, mostly having to do with crime and/or corruption (see also: crime).(5) The ""Revised & Expanded Edition"" was touted to me as essential because of all the additional articles and re-published blog posts etc. that are now included in this binding. I was a bit under-whelmed by these. They were certainly interesting and they do help illuminate aspects of the text but I didn't necessarily believe that they were essential. (The revisions vis-à-vis Stetson Kennedy's KKK research however: very essential.)"
355,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75637-sean-sullivan,4,"There are at least two ways you can read Freakanomics – as a fun and interesting little book that uses data to tell us little things about ourselves and the world. Or, you can see it as econometrics gone apeshit and finally taking over the world. I kind of view it as both.That said, I really enjoyed reading this. I think Levitt has developed some useful tools that can tell us some interesting stuff about the way little corners of our world are organized. I also think it is a little bit batty to think we can use economic models to prove a causal relationship between abortion laws and crime rates. There might be something there, but in order to come to a conclusion about two subjects so complex, Levitt must have had to control for so many other factors that I doubt his research is all that reliable. In comparison, the section on the economics of the street level drug trade is fascinating and probably close to accurate. The researchers were looking at a relatively small data set, sure, but I think it is still probably tells us at something useful about how that world works.I guess what I find most interesting about this one is the effect it has had on the culture. Economics is so hot right now. Everyone is into it, it is the undergraduate degree on the rise and plenty of those kids decided they liked economics by reading Levitt’s book. I am not sure if this is a good or a bad thing, but it is definitely a trend we can track, at least in part to this book. In the end this is a fast fun and diverting read, but don’t take it too seriously, cause I am pretty sure some of these finding are bunk."

(eg racist politicians are often condemned in public but voted for in the privacy of the voting booth.)And the good news...* You can vastly change your life for the better by getting online and doing your own research. Leaving it all to the experts - be they doctors, funeral directors or life insurance agents - is a mugs game.I found this book hugely provocative, but also fascinating, and it has certainly broadened my outlook by a whole stack. I'm not convinced....but it's got me wondering about a lot of stuff. It was also written with humour. Chapter 3 for instance is titled Why Do Drug Dealers Still Live with Their Moms?

363,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,3,"I once read somewhere that statistics can be used to prove anything. This book is evidence for the same.Steven D. Levitt, a ""rogue"" economist by his own admission, and who confesses that he is terrible at traditional economics, uses the methods of statistical analysis to look at the unexplored relations between things in society - like the resemblance between Japanese sumo wrestlers and American schoolteachers, why real-estate agents are similar to the Ku Klux Klan, whether parenting has any effect on how a child turns out... etc, etc. By the confession of the authors themselves, the book has no central theme - it just explores the ""hidden side of everything"". Levitt and Dubner say that economics has the tools to provide the right answers, but only a very few people ask the right questions.Some of his findings do have credibility (like that of schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers cheating to advance their careers, though I did not find anything earthshaking in those); some seem to be refreshing new perspectives (the similarity between the drug mafia and corporate houses, for example); some seem trite to the point of silliness (like the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agents being undone through the availability of information); and some seem to have some substance, but require further study of all parameters (how the station in life and the behaviour of parents affect the children). However, One finding, which is lauded by most reviewers of the book as startling, I found I could take with only a very large lump of salt: that the reduction in crime in the USA in the 1990's is due to the legalisation of abortions in 1973. The authors assume that crime is committed by unwanted children whom their mothers could not get rid of, and once they were allowed to, problem was solved! This, while at the same time arguing gun control is not having much effect either way while increase in police force and punishment is a deterrent, seems to me peddling to the right liberal narrative - at the same time totally ignoring the socioeconomic factors behind crime.As far as I am concerned, any kind of simplistic conclusions drawn from statistical data is suspect. Let me make this clear with an example close to my heart.In India, the state of Kerala in the south (from where I hail) tops in almost all Human Development Indices (HDI) such as health, education etc. However, the state also has the highest morbidity levels. What does this mean? Whether higher levels of general health leads to higher incidence of life-style diseases, or simply that since the healthcare and education are good, more people see doctors? Similarly, Kerala is fourth in India on the basis of reported crime. Does this mean that a higher level of education increases criminal tendencies, or that with a more aware population, more crimes get reported? Heated arguments take place on these questions regularly with no clear conclusions - because there are too many factors to make clear inferences.So does that mean Levitt and Dubner are talking through their hat, and are best ignored? No, in my opinion. This book is worth reading, if only for the unusual perspective. Also, it prompts us to think beyond the glib statistics the ""experts"" spout to intimidate the poor layperson, and see for ourselves."

377,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9832722-j,1,"About halfway through Freakonomics, and here's the summary thus far:* We are all liars (excepting the authors, apparently).* We are all cheaters (a few of the examples provided: sumo wrestlers; teachers; real estate agents; and pretty much everyone who owns, operates, or works in for-profit business).* We are all bigots (as demonstrated by intensive game show analysis).In fact, most every person is simply horrible. Except for crack dealers. Those guys are just misunderstood by the society that handed them a raw deal from birth.For the uninitiated, this New York Times bestseller (more than three million copies sold) details a lone, prodigious economist's meticulous examinations of some of society's “freaky” questions—debunking conventional wisdom using hard data gathered through deep and unconventional mining, or so the claim goes.Sadly, the book completely ignores its own correlation/causation warning and goes straight for the x-proves-y jugular—not infrequently, but with numerous instances per chapter, if not per page. Here's a simple (and comparatively less offensive) example from today's reading, included in an analysis of online dating:28% of the women on the site said they were blonde, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dying, or lying, or both.The assumptions behind such a statement are noteworthy. Must this conclusion follow from the data? No. The authors assume that those who use online dating sites mirror the population at large. What data do they offer to prove this is the case? None. So, how about some alternative hypotheses:* Older adults are greatly underrepresented on the Internet, compared to other age groups. Even considering those who do get online, how many 70-year-old women are posting profiles on match.com? Eliminating most of the grey-haired, white haired, salt-and-pepper haired, and bald women might alter the percentages, no?* Minority ethnicities are likewise underrepresented online. Many minorities who populate the United States (e.g., blacks, Hispanics, Middle Easterners, Asians) are genetically predisposed to having dark hair. How might this fact alter the odds?* For the sake of argument, let's assume blondness to be a characteristic that increases a woman's comparative physical attractiveness. Might it be reasonable that many such attractive women have become distressed by the type of man who hits on them in, say, a club? It's certainly quite possible that such men, who are likely searching for yet another sexual partner and nothing more, would be keenly interested in physical attractiveness. We could reasonably infer that most of the interactions such women have with men are primarily sexual in nature and, depending on her ultimate aims, much less desirable. How about those attractive women who claim they never get dates, because men are too intimidated to ask them out? What are the prospects of a successful long-term relationship for these women? A dating site sounds like a reasonable alternative to me.* Along those same lines, research has found that attractiveness positively correlates with income (i.e., attractive people tend to make more money). Aren't those with money more likely to (a) own a computer, (b) have the disposable income needed to purchase monthly Internet access and subscriptions to such dating sites, and/or (c) be busy enough with work as to make dating a more complicated enterprise—one demographic explicitly targeted by such web sites?* And my favorite, from a philosophical standpoint: what, precisely, defines blondness? One might say that blondness is defined by the having of blonde hair. By this criteria, does it matter if such hair color is natural or achieved by alternate methods (i.e., dying)? Might it not be that 28% of women actually are blonde, if we throw all those who dye their hair into a group with the natural blondes? After all, is the online dating web site's prompt ""hair color"" or ""natural hair color?""And these are just top-of-the-head scenarios offered by a regular guy with very little research background or statistical training. They all seem like reasonable questions to me—questions that should be explored before making such broad assertions. Does our virtuosic economist take every variable into consideration before drawing his conclusions? Because the book provides no clear reason to believe so, I must assume an answer in the negative.This is one of the simplest and, to my mind, least controversial claims made in the book thus far.

I think Levitt has developed some useful tools that can tell us some interesting stuff about the way little corners of our world are organized. I also think it is a little bit batty to think we can use economic models to prove a causal relationship between abortion laws and crime rates. There might be something there, but in order to come to a conclusion about two subjects so complex, Levitt must have had to control for so many other factors that I doubt his research is all that reliable. In comparison, the section on the economics of the street level drug trade is fascinating and probably close to accurate. The researchers were looking at a relatively small data set, sure, but I think it is still probably tells us at something useful about how that world works.I guess what I find most interesting about this one is the effect it has had on the culture. Economics is so hot right now. Everyone is into it, it is the undergraduate degree on the rise and plenty of those kids decided they liked economics by reading Levitt’s book. I am not sure if this is a good or a bad thing, but it is definitely a trend we can track, at least in part to this book. In the end this is a fast fun and diverting read, but don’t take it too seriously, cause I am pretty sure some of these finding are bunk."

393,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,3,"I once read somewhere that statistics can be used to prove anything. This book is evidence for the same.Steven D. Levitt, a ""rogue"" economist by his own admission, and who confesses that he is terrible at traditional economics, uses the methods of statistical analysis to look at the unexplored relations between things in society - like the resemblance between Japanese sumo wrestlers and American schoolteachers, why real-estate agents are similar to the Ku Klux Klan, whether parenting has any effect on how a child turns out... etc, etc. By the confession of the authors themselves, the book has no central theme - it just explores the ""hidden side of everything"". Levitt and Dubner say that economics has the tools to provide the right answers, but only a very few people ask the right questions.Some of his findings do have credibility (like that of schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers cheating to advance their careers, though I did not find anything earthshaking in those); some seem to be refreshing new perspectives (the similarity between the drug mafia and corporate houses, for example); some seem trite to the point of silliness (like the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agents being undone through the availability of information); and some seem to have some substance, but require further study of all parameters (how the station in life and the behaviour of parents affect the children). However, One finding, which is lauded by most reviewers of the book as startling, I found I could take with only a very large lump of salt: that the reduction in crime in the USA in the 1990's is due to the legalisation of abortions in 1973. The authors assume that crime is committed by unwanted children whom their mothers could not get rid of, and once they were allowed to, problem was solved! This, while at the same time arguing gun control is not having much effect either way while increase in police force and punishment is a deterrent, seems to me peddling to the right liberal narrative - at the same time totally ignoring the socioeconomic factors behind crime.As far as I am concerned, any kind of simplistic conclusions drawn from statistical data is suspect. Let me make this clear with an example close to my heart.In India, the state of Kerala in the south (from where I hail) tops in almost all Human Development Indices (HDI) such as health, education etc. However, the state also has the highest morbidity levels. What does this mean? Whether higher levels of general health leads to higher incidence of life-style diseases, or simply that since the healthcare and education are good, more people see doctors? Similarly, Kerala is fourth in India on the basis of reported crime. Does this mean that a higher level of education increases criminal tendencies, or that with a more aware population, more crimes get reported? Heated arguments take place on these questions regularly with no clear conclusions - because there are too many factors to make clear inferences.So does that mean Levitt and Dubner are talking through their hat, and are best ignored? No, in my opinion. This book is worth reading, if only for the unusual perspective. Also, it prompts us to think beyond the glib statistics the ""experts"" spout to intimidate the poor layperson, and see for ourselves."

407,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9832722-j,1,"About halfway through Freakonomics, and here's the summary thus far:* We are all liars (excepting the authors, apparently).* We are all cheaters (a few of the examples provided: sumo wrestlers; teachers; real estate agents; and pretty much everyone who owns, operates, or works in for-profit business).* We are all bigots (as demonstrated by intensive game show analysis).In fact, most every person is simply horrible. Except for crack dealers. Those guys are just misunderstood by the society that handed them a raw deal from birth.For the uninitiated, this New York Times bestseller (more than three million copies sold) details a lone, prodigious economist's meticulous examinations of some of society's “freaky” questions—debunking conventional wisdom using hard data gathered through deep and unconventional mining, or so the claim goes.Sadly, the book completely ignores its own correlation/causation warning and goes straight for the x-proves-y jugular—not infrequently, but with numerous instances per chapter, if not per page. Here's a simple (and comparatively less offensive) example from today's reading, included in an analysis of online dating:28% of the women on the site said they were blonde, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dying, or lying, or both.The assumptions behind such a statement are noteworthy. Must this conclusion follow from the data? No. The authors assume that those who use online dating sites mirror the population at large. What data do they offer to prove this is the case? None. So, how about some alternative hypotheses:* Older adults are greatly underrepresented on the Internet, compared to other age groups. Even considering those who do get online, how many 70-year-old women are posting profiles on match.com? Eliminating most of the grey-haired, white haired, salt-and-pepper haired, and bald women might alter the percentages, no?* Minority ethnicities are likewise underrepresented online. Many minorities who populate the United States (e.g., blacks, Hispanics, Middle Easterners, Asians) are genetically predisposed to having dark hair. How might this fact alter the odds?* For the sake of argument, let's assume blondness to be a characteristic that increases a woman's comparative physical attractiveness. Might it be reasonable that many such attractive women have become distressed by the type of man who hits on them in, say, a club? It's certainly quite possible that such men, who are likely searching for yet another sexual partner and nothing more, would be keenly interested in physical attractiveness. We could reasonably infer that most of the interactions such women have with men are primarily sexual in nature and, depending on her ultimate aims, much less desirable. How about those attractive women who claim they never get dates, because men are too intimidated to ask them out? What are the prospects of a successful long-term relationship for these women? A dating site sounds like a reasonable alternative to me.* Along those same lines, research has found that attractiveness positively correlates with income (i.e., attractive people tend to make more money). Aren't those with money more likely to (a) own a computer, (b) have the disposable income needed to purchase monthly Internet access and subscriptions to such dating sites, and/or (c) be busy enough with work as to make dating a more complicated enterprise—one demographic explicitly targeted by such web sites?* And my favorite, from a philosophical standpoint: what, precisely, defines blondness? One might say that blondness is defined by the having of blonde hair. By this criteria, does it matter if such hair color is natural or achieved by alternate methods (i.e., dying)? Might it not be that 28% of women actually are blonde, if we throw all those who dye their hair into a group with the natural blondes? After all, is the online dating web site's prompt ""hair color"" or ""natural hair color?""And these are just top-of-the-head scenarios offered by a regular guy with very little research background or statistical training. They all seem like reasonable questions to me—questions that should be explored before making such broad assertions. Does our virtuosic economist take every variable into consideration before drawing his conclusions? Because the book provides no clear reason to believe so, I must assume an answer in the negative.This is one of the simplest and, to my mind, least controversial claims made in the book thus far. The other conclusions drawn are more offensive, particularly when one considers the disturbing lack of evidence provided as support. I'll let you know how things turn out. I'm not expecting a sudden mea culpa."

Not an outrageous premise, makes sense. This leads to a discussion on information asymmetry, aka the expert and the mark. Here's where I get skeptical. Citing a mixture of anecdotal and statistical evidence on the behavior of doctors, real estate agents and car mechanics, Levitt argues (without challenge from me) that people with an informational advantage use that advantage strictly in a way that is most beneficial to them. So how then would Levitt justify this book and the ""expert"" position he has assumed? Why should we buy into his scant body of data?

In comparison, the section on the economics of the street level drug trade is fascinating and probably close to accurate. The researchers were looking at a relatively small data set, sure, but I think it is still probably tells us at something useful about how that world works.I guess what I find most interesting about this one is the effect it has had on the culture. Economics is so hot right now. Everyone is into it, it is the undergraduate degree on the rise and plenty of those kids decided they liked economics by reading Levitt’s book. I am not sure if this is a good or a bad thing, but it is definitely a trend we can track, at least in part to this book. In the end this is a fast fun and diverting read, but don’t take it too seriously, cause I am pretty sure some of these finding are bunk."

423,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,3,"I once read somewhere that statistics can be used to prove anything. This book is evidence for the same.Steven D. Levitt, a ""rogue"" economist by his own admission, and who confesses that he is terrible at traditional economics, uses the methods of statistical analysis to look at the unexplored relations between things in society - like the resemblance between Japanese sumo wrestlers and American schoolteachers, why real-estate agents are similar to the Ku Klux Klan, whether parenting has any effect on how a child turns out... etc, etc. By the confession of the authors themselves, the book has no central theme - it just explores the ""hidden side of everything"". Levitt and Dubner say that economics has the tools to provide the right answers, but only a very few people ask the right questions.Some of his findings do have credibility (like that of schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers cheating to advance their careers, though I did not find anything earthshaking in those); some seem to be refreshing new perspectives (the similarity between the drug mafia and corporate houses, for example); some seem trite to the point of silliness (like the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agents being undone through the availability of information); and some seem to have some substance, but require further study of all parameters (how the station in life and the behaviour of parents affect the children). However, One finding, which is lauded by most reviewers of the book as startling, I found I could take with only a very large lump of salt: that the reduction in crime in the USA in the 1990's is due to the legalisation of abortions in 1973. The authors assume that crime is committed by unwanted children whom their mothers could not get rid of, and once they were allowed to, problem was solved! This, while at the same time arguing gun control is not having much effect either way while increase in police force and punishment is a deterrent, seems to me peddling to the right liberal narrative - at the same time totally ignoring the socioeconomic factors behind crime.As far as I am concerned, any kind of simplistic conclusions drawn from statistical data is suspect. Let me make this clear with an example close to my heart.In India, the state of Kerala in the south (from where I hail) tops in almost all Human Development Indices (HDI) such as health, education etc. However, the state also has the highest morbidity levels. What does this mean? Whether higher levels of general health leads to higher incidence of life-style diseases, or simply that since the healthcare and education are good, more people see doctors? Similarly, Kerala is fourth in India on the basis of reported crime. Does this mean that a higher level of education increases criminal tendencies, or that with a more aware population, more crimes get reported? Heated arguments take place on these questions regularly with no clear conclusions - because there are too many factors to make clear inferences.So does that mean Levitt and Dubner are talking through their hat, and are best ignored? No, in my opinion. This book is worth reading, if only for the unusual perspective. Also, it prompts us to think beyond the glib statistics the ""experts"" spout to intimidate the poor layperson, and see for ourselves."

437,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9832722-j,1,"About halfway through Freakonomics, and here's the summary thus far:* We are all liars (excepting the authors, apparently).* We are all cheaters (a few of the examples provided: sumo wrestlers; teachers; real estate agents; and pretty much everyone who owns, operates, or works in for-profit business).* We are all bigots (as demonstrated by intensive game show analysis).In fact, most every person is simply horrible. Except for crack dealers. Those guys are just misunderstood by the society that handed them a raw deal from birth.For the uninitiated, this New York Times bestseller (more than three million copies sold) details a lone, prodigious economist's meticulous examinations of some of society's “freaky” questions—debunking conventional wisdom using hard data gathered through deep and unconventional mining, or so the claim goes.Sadly, the book completely ignores its own correlation/causation warning and goes straight for the x-proves-y jugular—not infrequently, but with numerous instances per chapter, if not per page. Here's a simple (and comparatively less offensive) example from today's reading, included in an analysis of online dating:28% of the women on the site said they were blonde, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dying, or lying, or both.The assumptions behind such a statement are noteworthy. Must this conclusion follow from the data? No. The authors assume that those who use online dating sites mirror the population at large. What data do they offer to prove this is the case? None. So, how about some alternative hypotheses:* Older adults are greatly underrepresented on the Internet, compared to other age groups. Even considering those who do get online, how many 70-year-old women are posting profiles on match.com? Eliminating most of the grey-haired, white haired, salt-and-pepper haired, and bald women might alter the percentages, no?* Minority ethnicities are likewise underrepresented online. Many minorities who populate the United States (e.g., blacks, Hispanics, Middle Easterners, Asians) are genetically predisposed to having dark hair. How might this fact alter the odds?* For the sake of argument, let's assume blondness to be a characteristic that increases a woman's comparative physical attractiveness. Might it be reasonable that many such attractive women have become distressed by the type of man who hits on them in, say, a club? It's certainly quite possible that such men, who are likely searching for yet another sexual partner and nothing more, would be keenly interested in physical attractiveness. We could reasonably infer that most of the interactions such women have with men are primarily sexual in nature and, depending on her ultimate aims, much less desirable. How about those attractive women who claim they never get dates, because men are too intimidated to ask them out? What are the prospects of a successful long-term relationship for these women? A dating site sounds like a reasonable alternative to me.* Along those same lines, research has found that attractiveness positively correlates with income (i.e., attractive people tend to make more money). Aren't those with money more likely to (a) own a computer, (b) have the disposable income needed to purchase monthly Internet access and subscriptions to such dating sites, and/or (c) be busy enough with work as to make dating a more complicated enterprise—one demographic explicitly targeted by such web sites?* And my favorite, from a philosophical standpoint: what, precisely, defines blondness? One might say that blondness is defined by the having of blonde hair. By this criteria, does it matter if such hair color is natural or achieved by alternate methods (i.e., dying)? Might it not be that 28% of women actually are blonde, if we throw all those who dye their hair into a group with the natural blondes? After all, is the online dating web site's prompt ""hair color"" or ""natural hair color?""And these are just top-of-the-head scenarios offered by a regular guy with very little research background or statistical training. They all seem like reasonable questions to me—questions that should be explored before making such broad assertions. Does our virtuosic economist take every variable into consideration before drawing his conclusions? Because the book provides no clear reason to believe so, I must assume an answer in the negative.This is one of the simplest and, to my mind, least controversial claims made in the book thus far. The other conclusions drawn are more offensive, particularly when one considers the disturbing lack of evidence provided as support. I'll let you know how things turn out. I'm not expecting a sudden mea culpa."

439,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20426-jen,2,"I feel like Levitt is maybe playing a joke on us. That we, in reading this book and buying into his challenges, are part of an economic experiment illustrating how experts use their position to benefit themselves and themselves only. As prone as I am to envision everything as a conspiracy, I think my support for this one is solid.The economics presented in Freakonomics centers around incentives--human behavior is 100% explained by which of a set of options is most rewarding to that individual. Not an outrageous premise, makes sense. This leads to a discussion on information asymmetry, aka the expert and the mark. Here's where I get skeptical. Citing a mixture of anecdotal and statistical evidence on the behavior of doctors, real estate agents and car mechanics, Levitt argues (without challenge from me) that people with an informational advantage use that advantage strictly in a way that is most beneficial to them. So how then would Levitt justify this book and the ""expert"" position he has assumed? Why should we buy into his scant body of data? Because he get to write a bestselling book, get more air time, speaking engagements, and social clout. He claims to be debunking ""conventional wisdom"" but I think he ends up spinning a whole new yarn.Subjects addressed: crime, abortion, experts, parenting, names, cheating schoolteachers."

I don't read much non-fiction (for example) and even less stuff about economics but I found this book quick to get through and I was able to take away their message without having to labor through it.That said, a few points:(1) They make some outrageous claims. To their credit, these claims appear to be backed up by the data. Their rhetoric is frequently hyperbolic though. At times it takes some patience to get the point of a given chapter. The arc tends to go like this: outrageous claim > brief discussion of that claim > discussion of parallel claim > presentation of data > analysis of data > tie them together > see if you can tear down the argument via convention wisdom > oops, conventional wisdom falls under scrutiny of the data. That said, the style makes it easy to break chapters up into small read-it-on-the-can chunks; if you read it that way, prepare to bite your tongue on any given objection until you have finished.(2) In light of #1: Levitt keeps mentioning that he's not much of an economist and even poorer with his math. But there's a lot of math in here. (Presented in a friendly, non-mathematical sort of way, but math nonetheless.) So... Is he just putting us on? Or (as A. would say) is it that ""stats"" aren't ""math""?(3) Also in light of #1: I would like to have seen more of the data. We get a lot of ""xx% decrease"" and ""such-and-such quadrupled"" but the figures themselves are obfuscated. There is an extensive appendix of notes at the end of the book which references specific articles; I'm assuming the ""hard numbers"" are in those articles. But my own background (i.e., bio-psych research papers) biases me to expect a more explicit presentation of those data. So that was disappointing.(4) Levitt & Dubner allege at the beginning of the book that there is no unifying theme. That's more/less crap. The unifying theme seems to be: here are some microeconomics, mostly having to do with crime and/or corruption (see also: crime).(5) The ""Revised & Expanded Edition"" was touted to me as essential because of all the additional articles and re-published blog posts etc. that are now included in this binding. I was a bit under-whelmed by these. They were certainly interesting and they do help illuminate aspects of the text but I didn't necessarily believe that they were essential. (The revisions vis-à-vis Stetson Kennedy's KKK research however: very essential.)"

And I am thus indebted to such an extent, that I can confess to arriving early for any flight departing from an airport with a bookstore for the sole purpose of securing a few additional minutes to browse books. If it were not for the practicalities of travelling, I would probably have bought this book much sooner than I did for I had been securing extra minutes in airport bookstores just to read through another chapter long before I actually bought it.You see, my travels are laden with a heavy debate: shall I pack my extra suitcase with books or groceries? I resolve this by alternating. For one trip to the Outside, a spare duffel bag will be dedicated to books and I will shun all opportunities to visit grocery stores just to preserve that determination. On the next visit, I will carry a spare cooler (rather than duffel bag) and splurge on leg of lamb and cheeses free of artificial coloring. The ultimate effect of this system, however, is a backlog in possessing the books I'd like to read.Finally, however, the fates aligned. I was travelling to Iowa on what I expected to be a gloriously grocery-focused trip. But my cooler broke as I was carrying it to the truck that we would drive to our local airport. There wasn't time to fix it. I was sad, of course, as I had been anticipating all the pork I was going to return with from Iowa. But I consoled myself with all those Iowa cookbooks I could now carry, and resolved not to prolong any lamentations over the cooler. And, oh, did I find myself lugging around a heavy library - such hours did I spend in Powells (there was a 1 week layover in Oregon) and Iowa City's bookstores. The day before we left Iowa, Nate told me about how much he enjoyed this book. His description renewed my interest, and I committed myself to buying a copy before we left. But, alas, we ran out of time. We didn't make it to a bookstore. It was sadder than the last-minute loss of the cooler. So when we arrived in Chicago, and had a few minutes to wait for the connecting flight to Alaska, and our gate was right next to a book kiosk, and I was pretty sure there was just enough room in my carry-on to squeeze in one more book - it was this book that I grabbed. I raced through it. Loving each chapter. I really can't recommend it enough. A fun read, for those who like to be entertained by books. Informative too, for those that like to read for knowledge, thought, and/or discourse. But what elevates it to favorite is that it alters perception and challenges assumptions. For what it's worth, I have no regrets that I carried this book rather than Iowa pork.....and I can think of no finer testament to a good book. Then again, most of my entertainment these days revolves around pickling turnips. So if turnips aren't your thing, feel free to take my recommendation with a grain of salt....but you should still read this book."

DubnerFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything is the debut non-fiction book by University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and New York Times journalist Stephen J. Dubner. It was published on April 12, 2005, by William Morrow. The book has been described as melding pop culture with economics. By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide. The book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by ""traditional"" economists. In Freakonomics, Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of incentives. The book's chapters cover:Chapter 1: Discovering cheating as applied to teachers and sumo wrestlers, as well as a typical Washington, D.C.–area bagel business and its customersChapter 2: Information control as applied to the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agentsChapter 3: The economics of drug dealing, including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealersChapter 4: The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime, contrasted with the policies and downfall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled ""The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime,"" written with John Donohue.)Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good parenting on educationChapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children (nominative determinism)تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه آگوست سال 2008 میلادیعنوان: اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های پنهان اجتماعی؛ نویسنده: استیون لویت، استپان‌ دابنر؛ مترجم: سعید مشیری؛ تهران: نشر نی‏‫، 1386؛ در 269 ص؛ شابک: 9789643129507؛ چاپ دوم 1392؛ موضوع: اقتصاد از نویسندگان امریکایی - جنبه های روانشناسی - سده 21 معنوان: اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها؛ نویسنده: استیون دی‌. لویت؛ مترجم: امیرحسین توکلی؛ تهران: سبزان‏‫، 1385؛ در 197 ص؛ شابک: 9789648249674؛ عنوان روی جلد: اقتصاد علم انگیزه‌ها: مهارت‌های لازم برای کشف ابعاد پنهان پدیده‌ها؛‬کتاب «فریکونومیکس» در باره ی اقتصاد، از اقتصاددان دانشگاه شیکاگو «استیون لویت» است، که نخستین بار در روز دوازدهم ماه آوریل سال 2005 میلادی منتشر شد. این کتاب تا پایان سال 2009 میلادی، بیش از چهار میلیون نسخه فروش داشته است. کتاب با عنوان «اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های اجتماعی» توسط نشر نی و با ترجمه ی جناب «سعید مشیری»، و با عنوان: «اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها»؛ با ترجمه ی جناب «امیرحسین توکلی»، منتشر شده است. کتاب چندین فصل دارد: درباره حقه زدن در شغل‌هایی مانند معلمی و کشتی‌گیران سومو؛ شباهت‌های کوکلوس‌کلان‌ و افراد معاملات ملکی؛ سیستم اقتصادی کارتل‌های مواد مخدر؛ تاثیر قانونی‌سازی سقط جنین در کاهش جرایم چندین سال بعد؛ نقش بسیار کم تربیت خوب کودکان توسط والدین در بهتر شدن آموزش و پرورششان؛ و الگوهای نامگذاری کودکان در یک جامعه. ا. شربیانی"
457,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249257-elise,3,"Levitt makes the lofty claim that economics is not swayed by moral sensibilities - it's a pure numbers game of course! However, not knowing much about him beyond his affiliation with the University of Chicago and what was written in the book, I can surmise that he is conservative, or at least what today would be inappropriately labeled ""moderate."" Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily...or at least I don't view it that way. Does it affect his conclusions? Absolutely. Levitt assumes his assertion that Roe v. Wade is responsible for the drop in crime experienced in the 1990s is the most controversial in the book, but I was not bothered by that conclusion at all. What did raise my ire a bit was his statement that ""Minorities commit more crimes."" Perhaps the pure numbers seem to show so, but upon closer examination and more careful thought, one might conclude that minorities are simply arrested and convicted more often. In many cases, Levitt does delve into the deeper ""behind the scenes"" reasons for why things happen, but in this glaring example, he delves no further than to admit that poverty might have a link to crime commission, and with more minorities in poverty more of them commit crimes. Might it also have a link to crime conviction? The white suburban kid who can afford a long and arduous defense, or whose father knows someone who can get the kid out of a jam, has a much better chance of having his case dismissed than a poor minority kid assigned a public defender (not to say that public defenders don't do good work - in fact many of them are some of the most amazing lawyers out there). Suffice to say the system is stacked against people in poverty and minorities, and Levitt fails to fully acknowledge this in his discussion of what causes and helps prevent crime. I wasn't so much angry as I was disappointed. When one of the brightest minds in our country can't see beyond his own prejudices, where is the hope for the rest of us? Levitt might be a genius, but he is woefully culturally incompetent. "
458,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/847862-paulius,1,"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (2005)There are intriguing elements in this book but when it comes to the larger picture, I find it sorely lacking. Levitt is a young star in the economics profession who enjoys playing games with interesting questions. For example, he assembles data to demonstrate that Roe v. Wade was critical to the drop in the crime rate in the 90s. On p. 125 he notes ""So it wasn't capital punishment that drove crime down, nor was it the booming economy. But higher rates of imprisonment did have a lot to do with it."" Also, on p. 139, he says ""Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness, unwantedness leads to high crime, legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime."" He also addresses the old nature vs. nurture argument or environment vs. genetics when he says, on pp. 175-176, ""Parents who are well educated, successful, and healthy tend to have children who test well in school, but it doesn't seem to much matter whether a child is trotted off to museums or spanked or sent to Head Start....The reality is that technique looks to be highly overrated....adopted children test relatively poorly in school, any influence the adoptive parents might exert is seemingly outweighed by the force of genetics. But...the parents were not powerless forever. By the time the adopted children bacame adults, they had veered sharply from the destiny that IQ alone might have predicted. Compared to similar children who were not put up for adoption, the adoptees were far more likely to attend college, to have a well-paid job, and to wait until they were out of their teens before getting married."" Despite these insights, I would never want to write a book like this because it doesn't go after the betterment of the human condition in a broad sense in the fashion that Adam Smith tried with Wealth of Nations in 1776. Levitt may be rewarded for his fun puzzles by a best-seller, but does any of this really help society toward healthier, happier families in the future?"
459,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4047121-william-moore,1,"Freakonomics: a rogue economist – Is that all there is?The title of Freakonomics tells us that Steven Levitt is a “rogue economist” exploring the “the hidden side of everything.” I have always been up for a rogue telling me about everything. Even a rogue telling me about anything appeals to me; you know that special insight that only a mischievous, perhaps unprincipled, but somehow likeable person has. From the title I even conjured up some noble rogue elephant tearing apart the civilized world after suffering a loss of habitat. I was up for rogue. Economics, I thought, is a damn good place for a rogue.Levitt is an economics professor at the University of Chicago and a winner of the John Bates Clark Medal. That medal is awarded every two years to the best economist under 40. It is given by the American Economic Association. If you know anything about this Vanderbilt University supported organization, it wouldn’t be for their search for rogues (although they got Milton Friedman right in 1951.)Steven Levitt is best-known for his findings on America’s falling crime-rate during the 1990s. Teenage murder rates were predicted to double. Instead they fell by more than 50% in the space of five years. By 2000 they were at their lowest in 35 years. But why? Well, a lot of people were taking the credit. They were citing economic growth, gun control, policing, imprisonment and even the death penalty as the reason. Levitt proved the cause as Roe vs Wade, the Supreme Court decision that lead to the repeal of abortion laws in the US. His research showed that children born into impoverished environments were more likely to grow up to become criminals. His analysis formed the elegant but uncomfortable syllogism: “Unwantedness leads to high crime; abortion leads to less unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime.”Levitt is saying, according to Dubner, that incentives and motivations are intimately linked in driving human behaviour. No breakthrough – my mum knew that! He does come through with some interesting proofs. His ingenious methods of analysing data reveal sometimes startling conclusions: Chicago public school teachers were helping their students cheat on state exams; Sumo wrestlers were fixing some of their matches; real-estate agents don’t really care about how much they sell your house for – only their own house, and my favourite; dope-dealers rarely make a good living. These results do amuse, surprise and even educate. In all these conclusions there is a haunting. Strangely, within these intriguing anomalies we never find that superbly-skilled rogue practitioner of economics. Instead we are left with a peppy little repertoire of cocktail chatter (beer-chat for me) and little else.Something went wrong in the writing of Freakonomics. In the reading there was the echo of Mark Twain’s comment that golf was “a good walk spoiled.” Yes it is provocative and interesting but it has a problem. If Malcolm Gladwell of Tipping Point fame says “Steven Levitt has the most interesting mind in America . . .” then the problem is uncompromisingly simple – we can’t find Levitt or his mind in this book!Without question we can find – actually, we can’t get away from – the other Stephen, Stephen Dubner. He is Levitt’s coauthor and a contributor to the New York Times. Dubner occasionally genuflects to Levitt’s genius, to his unique insight, and treats us to the odd passing anecdote. For most of the book though he relies on the coattails of Levitt to spin his own story.Dubner just doesn’t get Levitt. A flaw, especially given the hype in the title. He tells us that this very special economist is challenging the established lens through which we see conventional economics. The problem is what is conventional is never argued and the nature of the difference is never revealed. This new lens, we are told, uncovers – no exposes – the patterns of conventional thinking. These come by way of conclusive moments, end points really, that are sometimes remarkably fascinating and clearly capture interest. The question is, are these moments, this shopping-list of results, the only point of the book?Although Steven Levitt is apparently (or even paradoxically) the coauthor, he never actually appears. Not only is he not there but his methodology is never fully presented nor explained. Malcolm Gladwell goes on to say “. . . and reading Freakonomics is like going for a leisurely walk with him on a sunny summer day, as he waves his fingers in the air and turns everything you once thought to be true inside out.” Well the problem is we never get to go on that walk with Steven Levitt. He just might be nearby, but you never know for sure.The book is a first-person telling by Dubner. So it leaves Dubner responsible for that walk. It also leaves him responsible for the non-telling of either process or personality. It is an issue of depth. His preamble, along with the very bad An Explanatory Note are ill-chosen attempts at building an arcane, deified and mystical Steven Levitt. When we get into the book, we think we are going to meet Levitt, this “rogue economist” – but we never do.Dubner continually misses the mark. He let a good book and a great opportunity slip away. This is because he thinks the mark is simply some captivating Levitt conclusion. Even though I found myself relishing some of these points and was more than willing to tell these little tidbits to my friends; they leave forever undone some important thinking.The success of the book is that each story is portable. In their portability there is a weakness. If the point is, each story is an indicator of how we can mis-see the world, then how do we understand mis-seeing or recognise mis-telling? The only way to know would be to understand Levitt, economics, and the processes by which we make conventional and sometimes remarkably wrong conclusions.We never do. Instead, in each story there is an echo of missed opportunity. In each he takes us on some short walk on how we might see the world. The trouble is it is only a short walk with no critical path to understand how we got there or just where we might be going.Dubner tells us early on that when the publisher approached Steven Levitt, Levitt didn’t want to write a book. He finally did agree to write it, but along with Dubner who had done a story about him for the Times. So Dubner and the brilliant Levitt agree to coauthor. Freakonomics is the result of that division of labour. Presumably Levitt’s job was to continue mining of the reality of the “hidden side of everything.” Then what was Stephen Dubner’s job? The answer: The weaver of these disparate stories; the interpreter; the pattern-finder – the writer! Unfortunately a substantive telling never happens. It takes about half the book to slowly realize Dubner doesn’t really get Levitt – and neither do we.In the end this book bizarrely peters off into some kind of parenting manual. This is presumably because Dubner and Levitt are young fathers. Who knows? Dubner then thinks he can put Humpty back together by saying in the Epilogue that there is “no unifying theme” in Freakonomics. Well he got that right! Here he is alluding to a quote by the philosopher Robert Nozick where Nozick said that at 26 Levitt didn’t need a “unifying theme” as an economist. This may be right for a young economist – but it is not necessarily true of a book.Dubner’s patchwork attempt at an ending only exacerbates the reality of missed opportunity. Unfortunately it causes Freakonomics to read a bit like: What my really important really smart friend did on his summer vacation.William Moore"

Something like ""freakostatistics"" would make much more sense as the name of the book.2. in the introduction, the writers warn us that correlation does not imply causality. OK, agreed. But the rest of the book is just that: THEY act as if correlation and causality are the same thing (but they just have more ""fun"" explanation for stuff). What exactly is their proof that they are not ""inventing explanations"" based on correlation, without any real evidence of causation?This book is just a pile of interesting nonsense.EDIT (2016): There is another thing in the authors' arguments that really bother me (besides the ""correlation vs causality"" debate). The authors' approach to economics is that economics is all about how incentives play out. While incentives are no doubt important in human behaviour, this is an extremely shallow way of talking about economics. It is also very consistent with ""unfettered free market"" ideology, which says that the best way to organize society is through profit incentive. This is a dangerous proposition (as we have seen in 2008) and scientifically very doubtful."

The worst part was definitely his sweeping assumptions and conclusions based on his oh-so-reliable data. He thinks he can get away with this because the preface of the book says that he doesn't come to any conclusions--just asking questions, but the writing SUGGESTS conclusions. Just look at the subtitle, ""the Hidden Side of Everything."" He manipulates the reader into thinking there are connections between things by placing the data and a possible explanation on the same page. The problem with those explanations is that there is no scientific approach. Most of his data are purely observational--which is inherently flawed when trying to find cause and effect. I think the book started off wrong when the so-called economist claimed that he didn't like calculus. I'm not sure how you can call yourself an economist without calculus... Maybe you can't... and maybe that's why this book doesn't work."
464,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2803813-kirill-kovalenko,1,"It's hard to tell whether Levitt is a shill, not too bright or an amazing mixture of both. In true Chicago School style he pits unbridled laissez-faire at all and sundry in his whimsical little fashion. What we get is a truly melon-scratching mixture of sleight-of-hand and pop economics that revels in its eccentricity while being simultaneously superficial and misleading. Avoid. Avoid if you possibly can."
465,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17533257-jesse-lehrer,1,"The overarching point of this book is absolutely correct: conventional wisdom and what we perceive to be logical often is not. Our society is wrapped up and smothered in incorrect, dysfunctional assumptions that continue to rule our world and ruin our lives. Bigotry, ignorance, prejudice, fear, and the way people in power use these tools to divide and conquer us is at the root of all of our problems.That being said - everything else in this book is mediocre to bad. The writers make repeated assumptions and statements that are just flat out wrong. They make interesting points, and their comparisons are often thought provoking, but they could have used more of their own medicine.This book is clearly written by economists. Economics is one of the most useless, garbage ideologies ever created by humans. This is, of course, my opinion - but this book, I feel, only serves to prove that opinion. Over and over again the authors try to narrow down causes to one thing or another. They try to find the factor that changed everything. The abortion/crime essay is the clearest - abortion being legal is NOT the only factor that led to crime going down. There are thousands of factors that all contribute to everything that happens. Economists like to boil things down to numbers - instead of looking at people, looking at the complexity of life, they want a simple answer. There are no simple answers.In the book the authors do, occasionally, note that just one thing is not the cause - but they then go back on this again and again by making ridiculous statements, ie:""What sort of woman was most likely to take advantage of Roe v. Wade? Very often she was unmarried or in her teens or poor and sometimes all three."" This sentence gives the image of the typical woman getting an abortion to be a poor teenage girl. They don't say that's the majority, but the implication by choosing this example is that it's the norm. This is absolutely false - Planned Parenthood has plenty of information on this - the most common type of woman who gets an abortion is a woman who has already had a kid(s) and accidentally got pregnant and didn't want another kid. No stereotyping, no images of teenagers making bad choices, etc.Then there's this gem: ""Black Americans were hurt more by crack cocaine than by any other single cause since Jim Crow""I almost stopped reading the book there. That is so wrong, so offensive, so ignorant it is utterly ridiculous. There is NO SINGLE CAUSE of anything! This reductionist economist bullshit is exactly why I hate economics. And if there was a single cause - it wasn't fucking crack. It was racism, or structural racism, or criminalizing of young black people, or economic segregation, or reagonomics, or zoning laws, or re-districting, etc. etc. etc. Crack ruining black communities is, in actuality, a myth. Yes, it's a problem, yes, drug addiction in all forms is terrible, but this myth that crack just fell on black communities like a nuclear bomb leaving nothing behind but violence and death is just plain false. Additionally: the crackdown on drugs came BEFORE crack became an issue - it was a political device pre-dating crack used by Reagan to get votes from ignorant white people who feared black people. There are many books documenting this.In short: there are interesting points in this book, and the overall point is absolutely true. We all fall into believing bullshit that feels like it's obvious but is not. It's up to us individually, and as a society, to always seek the truth. However - the truth is not provided in a 20 page article as a single answer. If only the authors took their own ideas further the book might actually be worth something."
466,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830884-tony-viardo,1,"I was actually quite enthusiastic about reading this book, after having heard all the hype about it, and about Levitt.After I read it, however, I was greatly disappointed.This book is so overrated it's not just funny, it's baffling. To be honest, I really don't see how this author can be taken seriously. This book should be a farce to anyone who has any degree of skeptical thinking; any degree of respect for logic or empirical thought.Leavitt's conclusions are stretched like a rubber chicken (if not shot like one), his correlations are spurious at best, and his conclusions are no more insightful or incisive as what you would hear at a bull session with your friends, sitting around a bar, after knocking back a half dozen brews.Seriously, i really don't get all the hoopla that this title receives. Leavitt's only real talent seems to be collecting lists from public records sources, and then drawing the most asinine conclusions from them, and then writing them up with an ironic tone, just to sound smart. He seems to have accomplished a feat that would make PT Barnum proud... he thought up the most absurd conclusions, passed them off as expert observations, and then by sheer force of will got people to believe him. (You know the saying, ""the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it."")This tripe reminds of ""Who Moved My Cheese"" which was the biggest sham of a marketing snow job ever perpetrated in print, but was somehow widely hailed by business thinkers as a stroke of genius. This happened mainly because the first batch of readers, who got suckered into seriously reading it, didn't want to admit to everyone else that they got suckered into buying (for about 15 bucks) what amounted to bedtime story that any nanny could have come up with on the spot. So they proceeded to tell everyone they knew that the glorified pamphlet was actually wiser than the combined teachings of Confucious. Freakonomics should spend a whole chapter on that.The only real saving grace I found about the book is that I didn't pay full price for it. Ok, so now you know how I really feel about the book. Seriously, instead of buying this book, go spend your money on blue jeans, you're time will be better spent."

Which is a pity, as what it has to say is terribly interesting and amusing.The stuff at the end about how the name you are born with affects your life is very interesting. Also the idea, that is clearly true, but I'd never thought of it before, that people give their daughters crazier names than their sons.The point of this book is to say that sometimes there are very interesting correlations between things that seem quite disparate. The big one (and I haven't checked, but I assume this one didn't go down terribly well with the religious right in America) was the idea that the drop in violent crime in the US was due to the drop in violent criminals and this was due to there being less people brought up in abject poverty which is due to people being able to have access to abortion and not bringing unwanted children into the world.The comparisons between drug dealers and McDonalds as a corporate structure is now received wisdom - Obama quotes this in his book.Overall this is a great little read and quite fun - but really, I can't think of a single book that was improved by self-congratulation."

That may be a correlation but it is a huge stretch to claim it is a cause and effect. (The decreased crime rate is much better explained by Strauss & Howe in  Generations , by the way.) Why I gave this book 2 stars instead of 1 is because it does succeed in drawing interest to economics. "

If pressed, I'd assign this book to a category I'd call ""Books That People Who Love Malcolm Gladwell Might Also Enjoy."" There's no doubt that Steven D. Levitt is an expert number-cruncher, organizer, and researcher. The conclusions with which he attempts to wow the reader, however, are specious, hyperbolic, and generally lame-o-zoid.*Here's an example: The author explains a situation in which a parent will not permit their young child to go over to a friend's house because the child's friend's parents keep a gun in their home. The [first] parent, however, WILL allow their child to visit a DIFFERENT friend's house whose parents do NOT have a gun, but whose family has a swimming pool. The book then goes on to explain the statistics behind how many children die of gun deaths in this country in a given year versus how many children die in swimming pools in this country each year and determines that the [original] parent is not, according to the data, acting reasonably due to the fact that the likelihood of the child dying in a swimming pool far outweighs the likelihood of the child dying from a gun. Now, there's a reason why, when we talk about gun-safety, we don't talk about swimming pools. It's because swimming pools, if you'd believe it, don't have anything to do with gun safety.** In fact, that entire statistic-set, while an interesting mental exercise, is really no help to the parent. The statistic, were I a parent, that I would be interested in learning is something like: Out of all of the situations involving children dying from gun wounds in this country in a given year, how many of those instances took place when the child was visiting a friend's house? I don't know the answer to that, so, I'll just continue to be pleasantly outraged and move on to my next thought.This book, at its root, is arguing that the things we take for granted, like, belief-wise, might not only not be the case, but the actual truth of the matter(s) might be completely and utterly counter-intuitive to what we feel to be right. I think that's a great message and I wish this was simply a thinking-outside-the-box appreciation book. As a matter of fact, that's exactly what the [nearly two page] epilogue is arguing. With that in mind, I whole-heartedly recommend this book's epilogue. If, however, you're actually looking for a book to explain the hidden, counter-intuitive side to everything, like, for RIZZ, I'd recommend ""Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences"" by John Allen Paulos. BONUS THOUGHT: I should make it clear that I feel that the reason that ""Freakonomics"" is famous and ""Innumeracy"" is not famous, despite the fact that Mr. Paulos uses fewer pages to say more things more clearly, has to do with the fact that there is actual mathematics involved in the latter while the former just requires the reader to want to feel as though they're a smart person. FIN*But, some are for defs totes awes!**I certainly understand the value in thinking abstractly about complicated questions as a way to expand one's mind/cognitive-like-sitch; it's the conclusion that I'm attacking here."
478,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18423957-eleni,2,"For a book that so heavily relies on (mostly) untested assumptions, the repeated, passionate references to the distinction between causality and correlation is impressive if not audacious, to say the least. Suffice to say, 
“""As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions"".
 Exactly, Stephen. And that would work extremely well as an inside joke too. Unless you are implying that, in contrast with the usual textbooks, 
Freakonomics
 actually uses science to pose those questions. In which case, and given the absolute lack of evidence, statistics and insight on any methodological tools here, I can’t help wondering: Science? What science? Where? GIVE ME ONE PAGE. The other unfortunate thing here is the 
“Revised and Expanded edition”
 issue, which can generally mean a number of things, but in the case of 
Freakonomics
 in specific, it was, as we know, the result of a huge wave of negative feedback from reviewers due to:a) the fact that the authors massively exaggerated some of their assumptions (because, obviously: when you think you’re using science when you really are not, that’s just bound to happen) and, as if this isn't enough already, the authors’ reliance on some quite noticeable mathematical monstrosities.b) The self-praise:“Hi. I’m Stephen J. Dubner. And I’m co-authoring this book. The other author is Steven D. Levitt and he’s such a genius, radical economist that we’re thinking we’ll stuff 
Freakonomics
 with tons of newspaper clippings on how awesome he is. And that’s gonna be all over the place. Yes! Oh, in case you’re wondering what a too-cool-for-school unconventional genius like Steven D. Levitt is doing writing books instead of just being a weird recluse in permanent scientific euphoria, worry not! He wasn't interested in writing anything, silly ones (as if)! Not unless it was with me, because, in case you haven’t figured it out already, I’m a kickarse, amazing journalist too! So please read us. Please. We’ll make you feel important and scientific”.So apparently they got the message and scrapped most of that out of the book, hence the 
“Revised and Expanded”
 edition.But honestly, when I found all that out, for a moment I thought I needed to double check that I was actually reading the revised thing.I was? Really? REALLY? WHAT WAS THE FIRST VERSION LIKE THEN?And it’s certainly not my fault that Nick Hornby has the answer to nearly everything. I don’t remember which issue of The Believer he wrote that in, but it was along the lines of: 
""Freakonomics
 was a cool book and it made me feel smart. But what was it about?”Exactly, thank you.Two stars, because some of the questions they pose have interesting political and social implications, even though all questions are always posed through prose (with the use of loose logic at best) and absolutely not through the use of science.Oh. And the title is.. er.. misleading (Today I’m nice)."
479,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1336988-wendy,2,"I had high expectations for this book based on all of the hype. It's been on my to-read list for a long time, and after finally got around to reading it, I came away disappointed. The book is mostly a disjointed series of unexpected pairings phrased as questions, like ""What do sumo wrestlers and real estate agents have in common?"" Most of the questions would never be anything an average person would ask or wonder about. The book was a haphazard compilation of these pairings and odd questions but, to be fair, the authors explicitly state that from the get-go. I found the sections on parenting and naming babies to be the most interesting, with the rest of it being on the dull side. Many of these questions felt artificially contrived to create a ""freaky"" spin on economics but it felt forced. That was my chief issue with the book - it felt like it was trying to hard to be edgy and hip, like a geeky kid who tries to impress by looking cool and winds up falling flat.I found Dan Arielly's book, Predictably Irrational to be much more entertaining with a smoother flow. Arielly's book deals with behavioral economics and delves into the reasons why people make the choices they do, some of which seem rational but aren't and others which seem irrational but aren't. Arielly's book left me with a greater insight into my own choices and the mechanisms at work behind them. Freakonomics left me with a general thought of ""Hmm, seemingly unrelated stuff is actually related and vice versa."" For anyone interested in behavior economics presented in a very accessible and entertaining manner, I would recommend Arielly's book over Freakonomics, hands down."

483,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,3,"I once read somewhere that statistics can be used to prove anything. This book is evidence for the same.Steven D. Levitt, a ""rogue"" economist by his own admission, and who confesses that he is terrible at traditional economics, uses the methods of statistical analysis to look at the unexplored relations between things in society - like the resemblance between Japanese sumo wrestlers and American schoolteachers, why real-estate agents are similar to the Ku Klux Klan, whether parenting has any effect on how a child turns out... etc, etc. By the confession of the authors themselves, the book has no central theme - it just explores the ""hidden side of everything"". Levitt and Dubner say that economics has the tools to provide the right answers, but only a very few people ask the right questions.Some of his findings do have credibility (like that of schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers cheating to advance their careers, though I did not find anything earthshaking in those); some seem to be refreshing new perspectives (the similarity between the drug mafia and corporate houses, for example); some seem trite to the point of silliness (like the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agents being undone through the availability of information); and some seem to have some substance, but require further study of all parameters (how the station in life and the behaviour of parents affect the children). However, One finding, which is lauded by most reviewers of the book as startling, I found I could take with only a very large lump of salt: that the reduction in crime in the USA in the 1990's is due to the legalisation of abortions in 1973. The authors assume that crime is committed by unwanted children whom their mothers could not get rid of, and once they were allowed to, problem was solved! This, while at the same time arguing gun control is not having much effect either way while increase in police force and punishment is a deterrent, seems to me peddling to the right liberal narrative - at the same time totally ignoring the socioeconomic factors behind crime.As far as I am concerned, any kind of simplistic conclusions drawn from statistical data is suspect. Let me make this clear with an example close to my heart.In India, the state of Kerala in the south (from where I hail) tops in almost all Human Development Indices (HDI) such as health, education etc. However, the state also has the highest morbidity levels. What does this mean? Whether higher levels of general health leads to higher incidence of life-style diseases, or simply that since the healthcare and education are good, more people see doctors? Similarly, Kerala is fourth in India on the basis of reported crime. Does this mean that a higher level of education increases criminal tendencies, or that with a more aware population, more crimes get reported? Heated arguments take place on these questions regularly with no clear conclusions - because there are too many factors to make clear inferences.So does that mean Levitt and Dubner are talking through their hat, and are best ignored? No, in my opinion. This book is worth reading, if only for the unusual perspective. Also, it prompts us to think beyond the glib statistics the ""experts"" spout to intimidate the poor layperson, and see for ourselves."

497,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9832722-j,1,"About halfway through Freakonomics, and here's the summary thus far:* We are all liars (excepting the authors, apparently).* We are all cheaters (a few of the examples provided: sumo wrestlers; teachers; real estate agents; and pretty much everyone who owns, operates, or works in for-profit business).* We are all bigots (as demonstrated by intensive game show analysis).In fact, most every person is simply horrible. Except for crack dealers. Those guys are just misunderstood by the society that handed them a raw deal from birth.For the uninitiated, this New York Times bestseller (more than three million copies sold) details a lone, prodigious economist's meticulous examinations of some of society's “freaky” questions—debunking conventional wisdom using hard data gathered through deep and unconventional mining, or so the claim goes.Sadly, the book completely ignores its own correlation/causation warning and goes straight for the x-proves-y jugular—not infrequently, but with numerous instances per chapter, if not per page. Here's a simple (and comparatively less offensive) example from today's reading, included in an analysis of online dating:28% of the women on the site said they were blonde, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dying, or lying, or both.The assumptions behind such a statement are noteworthy. Must this conclusion follow from the data? No. The authors assume that those who use online dating sites mirror the population at large. What data do they offer to prove this is the case? None. So, how about some alternative hypotheses:* Older adults are greatly underrepresented on the Internet, compared to other age groups. Even considering those who do get online, how many 70-year-old women are posting profiles on match.com? Eliminating most of the grey-haired, white haired, salt-and-pepper haired, and bald women might alter the percentages, no?* Minority ethnicities are likewise underrepresented online. Many minorities who populate the United States (e.g., blacks, Hispanics, Middle Easterners, Asians) are genetically predisposed to having dark hair. How might this fact alter the odds?* For the sake of argument, let's assume blondness to be a characteristic that increases a woman's comparative physical attractiveness. Might it be reasonable that many such attractive women have become distressed by the type of man who hits on them in, say, a club? It's certainly quite possible that such men, who are likely searching for yet another sexual partner and nothing more, would be keenly interested in physical attractiveness. We could reasonably infer that most of the interactions such women have with men are primarily sexual in nature and, depending on her ultimate aims, much less desirable. How about those attractive women who claim they never get dates, because men are too intimidated to ask them out? What are the prospects of a successful long-term relationship for these women? A dating site sounds like a reasonable alternative to me.* Along those same lines, research has found that attractiveness positively correlates with income (i.e., attractive people tend to make more money). Aren't those with money more likely to (a) own a computer, (b) have the disposable income needed to purchase monthly Internet access and subscriptions to such dating sites, and/or (c) be busy enough with work as to make dating a more complicated enterprise—one demographic explicitly targeted by such web sites?* And my favorite, from a philosophical standpoint: what, precisely, defines blondness? One might say that blondness is defined by the having of blonde hair. By this criteria, does it matter if such hair color is natural or achieved by alternate methods (i.e., dying)? Might it not be that 28% of women actually are blonde, if we throw all those who dye their hair into a group with the natural blondes? After all, is the online dating web site's prompt ""hair color"" or ""natural hair color?""And these are just top-of-the-head scenarios offered by a regular guy with very little research background or statistical training. They all seem like reasonable questions to me—questions that should be explored before making such broad assertions. Does our virtuosic economist take every variable into consideration before drawing his conclusions? Because the book provides no clear reason to believe so, I must assume an answer in the negative.This is one of the simplest and, to my mind, least controversial claims made in the book thus far. The other conclusions drawn are more offensive, particularly when one considers the disturbing lack of evidence provided as support. I'll let you know how things turn out. I'm not expecting a sudden mea culpa."

As prone as I am to envision everything as a conspiracy, I think my support for this one is solid.The economics presented in Freakonomics centers around incentives--human behavior is 100% explained by which of a set of options is most rewarding to that individual. Not an outrageous premise, makes sense. This leads to a discussion on information asymmetry, aka the expert and the mark. Here's where I get skeptical. Citing a mixture of anecdotal and statistical evidence on the behavior of doctors, real estate agents and car mechanics, Levitt argues (without challenge from me) that people with an informational advantage use that advantage strictly in a way that is most beneficial to them. So how then would Levitt justify this book and the ""expert"" position he has assumed? Why should we buy into his scant body of data?

I don't read much non-fiction (for example) and even less stuff about economics but I found this book quick to get through and I was able to take away their message without having to labor through it.That said, a few points:(1) They make some outrageous claims. To their credit, these claims appear to be backed up by the data. Their rhetoric is frequently hyperbolic though. At times it takes some patience to get the point of a given chapter. The arc tends to go like this: outrageous claim > brief discussion of that claim > discussion of parallel claim > presentation of data > analysis of data > tie them together > see if you can tear down the argument via convention wisdom > oops, conventional wisdom falls under scrutiny of the data. That said, the style makes it easy to break chapters up into small read-it-on-the-can chunks; if you read it that way, prepare to bite your tongue on any given objection until you have finished.(2) In light of #1: Levitt keeps mentioning that he's not much of an economist and even poorer with his math. But there's a lot of math in here. (Presented in a friendly, non-mathematical sort of way, but math nonetheless.) So... Is he just putting us on? Or (as A. would say) is it that ""stats"" aren't ""math""?(3) Also in light of #1: I would like to have seen more of the data. We get a lot of ""xx% decrease"" and ""such-and-such quadrupled"" but the figures themselves are obfuscated. There is an extensive appendix of notes at the end of the book which references specific articles; I'm assuming the ""hard numbers"" are in those articles.

So that was disappointing.(4) Levitt & Dubner allege at the beginning of the book that there is no unifying theme. That's more/less crap. The unifying theme seems to be: here are some microeconomics, mostly having to do with crime and/or corruption (see also: crime).(5) The ""Revised & Expanded Edition"" was touted to me as essential because of all the additional articles and re-published blog posts etc. that are now included in this binding.

I also think it is a little bit batty to think we can use economic models to prove a causal relationship between abortion laws and crime rates. There might be something there, but in order to come to a conclusion about two subjects so complex, Levitt must have had to control for so many other factors that I doubt his research is all that reliable. In comparison, the section on the economics of the street level drug trade is fascinating and probably close to accurate. The researchers were looking at a relatively small data set, sure, but I think it is still probably tells us at something useful about how that world works.I guess what I find most interesting about this one is the effect it has had on the culture.

513,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,3,"I once read somewhere that statistics can be used to prove anything. This book is evidence for the same.Steven D. Levitt, a ""rogue"" economist by his own admission, and who confesses that he is terrible at traditional economics, uses the methods of statistical analysis to look at the unexplored relations between things in society - like the resemblance between Japanese sumo wrestlers and American schoolteachers, why real-estate agents are similar to the Ku Klux Klan, whether parenting has any effect on how a child turns out... etc, etc. By the confession of the authors themselves, the book has no central theme - it just explores the ""hidden side of everything"". Levitt and Dubner say that economics has the tools to provide the right answers, but only a very few people ask the right questions.Some of his findings do have credibility (like that of schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers cheating to advance their careers, though I did not find anything earthshaking in those); some seem to be refreshing new perspectives (the similarity between the drug mafia and corporate houses, for example); some seem trite to the point of silliness (like the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agents being undone through the availability of information); and some seem to have some substance, but require further study of all parameters (how the station in life and the behaviour of parents affect the children). However, One finding, which is lauded by most reviewers of the book as startling, I found I could take with only a very large lump of salt: that the reduction in crime in the USA in the 1990's is due to the legalisation of abortions in 1973. The authors assume that crime is committed by unwanted children whom their mothers could not get rid of, and once they were allowed to, problem was solved! This, while at the same time arguing gun control is not having much effect either way while increase in police force and punishment is a deterrent, seems to me peddling to the right liberal narrative - at the same time totally ignoring the socioeconomic factors behind crime.As far as I am concerned, any kind of simplistic conclusions drawn from statistical data is suspect. Let me make this clear with an example close to my heart.In India, the state of Kerala in the south (from where I hail) tops in almost all Human Development Indices (HDI) such as health, education etc. However, the state also has the highest morbidity levels. What does this mean? Whether higher levels of general health leads to higher incidence of life-style diseases, or simply that since the healthcare and education are good, more people see doctors? Similarly, Kerala is fourth in India on the basis of reported crime. Does this mean that a higher level of education increases criminal tendencies, or that with a more aware population, more crimes get reported? Heated arguments take place on these questions regularly with no clear conclusions - because there are too many factors to make clear inferences.So does that mean Levitt and Dubner are talking through their hat, and are best ignored? No, in my opinion. This book is worth reading, if only for the unusual perspective. Also, it prompts us to think beyond the glib statistics the ""experts"" spout to intimidate the poor layperson, and see for ourselves."

527,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9832722-j,1,"About halfway through Freakonomics, and here's the summary thus far:* We are all liars (excepting the authors, apparently).* We are all cheaters (a few of the examples provided: sumo wrestlers; teachers; real estate agents; and pretty much everyone who owns, operates, or works in for-profit business).* We are all bigots (as demonstrated by intensive game show analysis).In fact, most every person is simply horrible. Except for crack dealers. Those guys are just misunderstood by the society that handed them a raw deal from birth.For the uninitiated, this New York Times bestseller (more than three million copies sold) details a lone, prodigious economist's meticulous examinations of some of society's “freaky” questions—debunking conventional wisdom using hard data gathered through deep and unconventional mining, or so the claim goes.Sadly, the book completely ignores its own correlation/causation warning and goes straight for the x-proves-y jugular—not infrequently, but with numerous instances per chapter, if not per page. Here's a simple (and comparatively less offensive) example from today's reading, included in an analysis of online dating:28% of the women on the site said they were blonde, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dying, or lying, or both.The assumptions behind such a statement are noteworthy. Must this conclusion follow from the data? No. The authors assume that those who use online dating sites mirror the population at large. What data do they offer to prove this is the case? None. So, how about some alternative hypotheses:* Older adults are greatly underrepresented on the Internet, compared to other age groups. Even considering those who do get online, how many 70-year-old women are posting profiles on match.com? Eliminating most of the grey-haired, white haired, salt-and-pepper haired, and bald women might alter the percentages, no?* Minority ethnicities are likewise underrepresented online. Many minorities who populate the United States (e.g., blacks, Hispanics, Middle Easterners, Asians) are genetically predisposed to having dark hair. How might this fact alter the odds?* For the sake of argument, let's assume blondness to be a characteristic that increases a woman's comparative physical attractiveness. Might it be reasonable that many such attractive women have become distressed by the type of man who hits on them in, say, a club? It's certainly quite possible that such men, who are likely searching for yet another sexual partner and nothing more, would be keenly interested in physical attractiveness. We could reasonably infer that most of the interactions such women have with men are primarily sexual in nature and, depending on her ultimate aims, much less desirable. How about those attractive women who claim they never get dates, because men are too intimidated to ask them out? What are the prospects of a successful long-term relationship for these women? A dating site sounds like a reasonable alternative to me.* Along those same lines, research has found that attractiveness positively correlates with income (i.e., attractive people tend to make more money). Aren't those with money more likely to (a) own a computer, (b) have the disposable income needed to purchase monthly Internet access and subscriptions to such dating sites, and/or (c) be busy enough with work as to make dating a more complicated enterprise—one demographic explicitly targeted by such web sites?* And my favorite, from a philosophical standpoint: what, precisely, defines blondness? One might say that blondness is defined by the having of blonde hair. By this criteria, does it matter if such hair color is natural or achieved by alternate methods (i.e., dying)? Might it not be that 28% of women actually are blonde, if we throw all those who dye their hair into a group with the natural blondes? After all, is the online dating web site's prompt ""hair color"" or ""natural hair color?""And these are just top-of-the-head scenarios offered by a regular guy with very little research background or statistical training. They all seem like reasonable questions to me—questions that should be explored before making such broad assertions. Does our virtuosic economist take every variable into consideration before drawing his conclusions? Because the book provides no clear reason to believe so, I must assume an answer in the negative.This is one of the simplest and, to my mind, least controversial claims made in the book thus far. The other conclusions drawn are more offensive, particularly when one considers the disturbing lack of evidence provided as support. I'll let you know how things turn out. I'm not expecting a sudden mea culpa."

529,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20426-jen,2,"I feel like Levitt is maybe playing a joke on us. That we, in reading this book and buying into his challenges, are part of an economic experiment illustrating how experts use their position to benefit themselves and themselves only. As prone as I am to envision everything as a conspiracy, I think my support for this one is solid.The economics presented in Freakonomics centers around incentives--human behavior is 100% explained by which of a set of options is most rewarding to that individual. Not an outrageous premise, makes sense. This leads to a discussion on information asymmetry, aka the expert and the mark. Here's where I get skeptical. Citing a mixture of anecdotal and statistical evidence on the behavior of doctors, real estate agents and car mechanics, Levitt argues (without challenge from me) that people with an informational advantage use that advantage strictly in a way that is most beneficial to them. So how then would Levitt justify this book and the ""expert"" position he has assumed? Why should we buy into his scant body of data? Because he get to write a bestselling book, get more air time, speaking engagements, and social clout. He claims to be debunking ""conventional wisdom"" but I think he ends up spinning a whole new yarn.Subjects addressed: crime, abortion, experts, parenting, names, cheating schoolteachers."

I don't read much non-fiction (for example) and even less stuff about economics but I found this book quick to get through and I was able to take away their message without having to labor through it.That said, a few points:(1) They make some outrageous claims. To their credit, these claims appear to be backed up by the data. Their rhetoric is frequently hyperbolic though. At times it takes some patience to get the point of a given chapter. The arc tends to go like this: outrageous claim > brief discussion of that claim > discussion of parallel claim > presentation of data > analysis of data > tie them together > see if you can tear down the argument via convention wisdom > oops, conventional wisdom falls under scrutiny of the data. That said, the style makes it easy to break chapters up into small read-it-on-the-can chunks; if you read it that way, prepare to bite your tongue on any given objection until you have finished.(2) In light of #1: Levitt keeps mentioning that he's not much of an economist and even poorer with his math. But there's a lot of math in here. (Presented in a friendly, non-mathematical sort of way, but math nonetheless.) So... Is he just putting us on? Or (as A. would say) is it that ""stats"" aren't ""math""?(3) Also in light of #1: I would like to have seen more of the data. We get a lot of ""xx% decrease"" and ""such-and-such quadrupled"" but the figures themselves are obfuscated.

The unexpected results of the legalization of abortion – crime reductionUsing statistics and logic to show how teachers and sumo wrestlers can be shown to cheatWhat is the impact of greater spending in political campaignsThese and other questions, and their examination by Levitt make for an educational, thought-provoking, and eminently entertaining read. P 13Morality, it could be argued, represents the way that people would like the world to work—whereas economics represents how it actually does work. Economics is above all a science of measurement. It compromises an extraordinarily powerful and flexible set of tools that can reliably assess a thicket of information to determine the effect of any one factor, or even the whole effect. That’s what “the economy” is, after all: a thicket of information about jobs and real estate and banking and investment. But the tools of economics can be just as easily applied to subjects that are more—well, more interesting. This book, then, has been written from a very specific worldview, based on a few fundamental ideas:	Incentives are the cornerstone of modern life. And understanding them—or, often, ferreting them out—is the key to solving just about any riddle, from violent crime to sports cheating to online dating. 	The conventional wisdom is often wrong. Crime didn’t keep soaring in the 1990s, money alone doesn’t win elections, and—surprise—drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health. 	Dramatic effects often have distant, even subtle, causes. 	Experts—from criminologists to real-estate agents—use their informational advantage to serve their own agendaP 71Armed with information, experts can exert a gigantic, if unspoken, leverage, fear. Fear that your children will find you dead on the bathroom floor of a heart attack if you do not have angioplasty surgery. Fear that a cheap casket will expose your grandmother to a terrible underground fate. Fear that a $25,000 car will crumple like a toy in an accident, whereas a $50,000 car will wrap your loved ones in a cocoon of impregnable steel. The fear created by commercial experts may not quite rival the fear created by terrorists like the Ku Klux Klan, but the principle is the sameP 155…nature-nurture discrepancies were addressed in a 1998 book by a little-known textbook author named Judith Rich Harris. The Nurture Assumption was in effect an attack on obsessive parenting, a book so provocative that it required two subtitles Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do and Parents Matter Much Less Than You Think and Peers Matter More. Harris argued, albeit gently, that parents are wrong to think that they contribute so mightily to their child’s personality. This belief, she wrote, was a “cultural myth.” Harris argued that the top-down influence of parents is overwhelmed by the grassroots effect of peer pressure, the blunt force applied each day by friends and schoolmates.

But I think we should all mistrust an economist who would hitch his wagon to a scribbler on the make (a move that also advertises young Levitt's thirst for fame and lucre). Other superstar economists -- Galbraith or Friedman, for instance -- had a very obvious ideological agenda, and they stated it openly. A superstar beyond his precursors' wildest nightmares, Levitt claims to have no agenda whatsoever, and remains guided by his Bucky-Fuller-esque curiosity and semi-autistic amorality. Or so it seems. I think he'll out himself as a neoliberal, or at least a creepy libertarian, soon enough (maybe he has already? I don't read his blog). No true economic lefty could keep his rep aloft in the current publishing climate for this long, even if his musings are decorated with soulless Social Statics and Revenge of the Nerds style curiosity. Also, damn near everyone calls him ""That Freakonomics Guy,"" while conjuring a Pavlovian drool-drenched image of that Granny Smith Tangerine on the cover. Independent thinker though he may seem, Levitt is obviously the product of brand management now. Until he de-pimps himself from the corporate world, I'd rather listen to Mr. Clean or Tony the Tiger.

Interesting in parts, obvious in others (as in the comparison of the structure of a drug dealing network to that of McDonalds) , apparently methodologically unsound in places, a curate's egg.The major problem is the difficulty the authors have in escaping the gravity of their own biases which then pull them in certain directions. For example the case of fraud and cheating in Sumo wrestling. Statistically we might be happy with the authors' report that after a certain point in competitions fairly fought bouts were not occurring, but that does not prove their claim that money was changing hands. It seems more than a little cheeky to describe one of the authors as a rogue economist when his rogueishness consists not of wayward or distinctive thinking but mostly in commentating upon the work of other researchers.

If you appreciate counter-intuitive thinking and value approaches to discovering what's ACTUALLY true rather than what ""common sense"" tells us is true, then you will greatly appreciate Steven Levitt's methods. If you're after directly practical knowledge only, you will not value this much. If you are big into strictly traditional thinking, you will HATE this. Be ready to separate what you believe to be moral from what actually happens (they don't always agree, even when I don't like it). So assess yourself and decide accordingly. If you want to know interesting truths and value things that are counter-intuitive even when it flies in the face of a deeply held belief, this is for you. Dr. Levitt's approach is so refreshing; ignoring what seems to be true and always wondering what actually is true, then leveraging data he finds to discover what it can reveal (not what he wants, not what you or I want, but what actually IS). He's a refreshing oddball that I wish I could know personally so I would gain more of that fresh look."

But the scientist and statistician and academic in me was completely horrified-- this is a one-sided discussion of Levitt's ideas, which a brief glance at the internet tells me have in some cases been disputed in-depth in the economic literature. Many of the cases that claimed to be ""simple questions"" with ""simple answers"", if you just defied conventional wisdom, were improper questions from both a scientific and statistical point of view. Take abortion, which the authors claim reduced crime because ""Unwantedness leads to high crime, abortion leads to less unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime."" A vast simplification on many levels, but it completely simplifies a sociological issue-- what is unwantedness? Is abortion the ONLY means of controlling whether a woman has a child or not? Could you or could you not make the same argument about birth control, and if not, why? The explanations of statistics were laughable-- that statistical analysis is more of an art than a science. No, it is a science, just a manipulable one. The intentional manipulation is not artful, it is dishonest. The treatment of this topic seemed like it was screaming for attention, rather than really trying to understand the topic at hand. I recommend reading this with the same skepticism that the authors recommend for conventional wisdom, which is to say, a lot. I hope, for the sake of the field of economics, that Levitt's scientific writing is much more careful and accurate.If you are looking for a very readable book on economics, I highly recommend ""The Undercover Economist"" instead!"

I think it's lack of a theme (which the authors clearly warn readers about ahead of time) contributed to my overall ""meh"" attitude. Additionally, I found myself yearning for more than just Levitt's observations and findings. For example, simply stating that data shows higher abortion rates yield lower crime rates and then not delving too deeply into the reasons that underlie this phenomena just didn't do it for me. That's an extremely weighty thing to state, regardless of if you have data to back you up or not. I guess I wanted some sociology mixed in with my economics. Alas, Levitt is an economist not a sociologist or political scientist.I also want to add that as someone with an MBA (thus, I took classes on data in grad school and would be fine to never run a regression again despite how interesting it can be) and who works with data at her job, I know firsthand how easy it is to manipulate data. I want to assume that Steven Levitt was completely neutral in his research, but who can really know except for Levitt himself? And, who funded all of his studies? I realize Harvard comped him for some work, but what about his studies on Chicago Public Schools? I find it interesting that a school system would turn over their data to him whenever it was inevitable that he find some questionable (and illegal) things going on. I don't know. Again, I want to assume that he was completely neutral, but spinning data is pretty darn easy. And even assuming he completed his research with no bias, what about the actual data he was working with. Some of the ""perfect parent"" data (I think it was still Chicago Public School data) seemed very subjective. For example, how exactly was ""a lot"" quantified in the the data point regarding ""parents who have a lot of books in their home""*? I have ~200-300 books and don't really consider that ""a lot."" You might disagree which is my entire point. Won't different people quantify and thus answer that question differently? Ok, I'm going too deep into this. Basically, I know first hand that you can tell whatever story you want to with data, so I wonder what approach Levitt took in order to remain unprejudiced and unbiased.And finally, I imagine I wasn't the only one holding their breath while reading over the low income baby names. Not that it means anything, but it was still a bit jarring to hear how a person's name reflects their parents' income. Some of the names were very obviously high or low income names, but it was interesting to hear how many common names have moved back and forth on the different lists over time. That portion of the book was undoubtedly the most interesting, and seemingly the most objective--both from sociological and data standpoints.*might not be the exact wording used, but I listened to the book and thus can't reference the print."
559,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"Is legalizing abortion responsible for the drop in crime rates? First of all this book is not really about economics but turning controversial concepts around and looking at them from a different point of view. Thereby the title is misleading and really doesn’t represent the contentI absolutely liked the concept and the very engaging and compelling writing style of this book, which reminded me enormously of Malcom Gladwell. It‘s written by Levitt who is professor for economics at the university of Chicago and offers you to look at widely spread political perceptions differently.This book caused an extreme amount of noise and criticism, mostly for claiming that the legalization of abortion caused the 1990s crime drop. Also you learn about how teachers falsify their students test scores to benefit themselfes, how children superman stories on the radio destroyed the klux klux klan, about the economics of drug dealing, the effect of good parenting on education and how naming your children affects their path.Some criticise Freakonomics arguing that it would contain large, impactful claims without providing enough references or just those who benefit the thesis. But from a different point of view it simply can be seen as offering a thought provoking analysis, which is a road I choose to go. I‘m not a reader who ""believes"" every statistic or hypothesis presented to me without reflection , but always think for myself.I absolutely enjoyed reading it, it’s extremely entertaining while offering a different view on the world. Alone the approach to look at every aspect in life from different perspectives makes this worth reading! I recommend this book to anyone who loves nonfiction.Very provocative and full of great insights, I see why this was a New York Times bestseller."
560,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610433-midnightfaerie,3,"Freakonomics by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner didn't impress me as much as I thought it would. A book about economics and finding correlations in things you wouldn't necessarily surmise, Levitt and Dubner seem to be really arguing that the defining indicator behind these studies is incentive. Perhaps it's my background in Psychology, but a lot of this seemed common sense to me. There were some parts I really enjoyed though. The two chapters I found to be the most interesting out of the whole book, were two towards the end. The chapter on What makes a good parent (i.e. What factors of the parent affect the child's success in life?) and A Roshanda by Any Other Name (i.e. Is black culture a cause of racial inequality or is it a consequence?). The chapter on parenting is interesting, and in some ways, not too surprising. Kids that have a lot of books in their home tend to do better in school. Kids born of a low birth weight tend to not do as well. If we think about it, a parent with lots of books cares about and might be more invested in their child's education than one without books, which of course, would lead to the child having better test scores. If we think about it, the child with the low birth weight is probably one with a teenage mother or one who doesn't take of herself as much, maybe a smoker or drinker, thus leading us to believe that she doesn't care about the child as much either. Some of the other factors they looked at that I found interesting were whether the child was adopted, whether the mother was over 30 when she had the child, whether the child went to HeadStart, whether the child frequently watched television, whether the child was spanked, and if the parents were involved with PTA. Some of the results were surprising. I won't give them all away, but they were always what you might expect. The chapter about racial inequality relating to names that parents give their children I found fascinating. They talked about a father who named one son Loser and one son Winner and how they turned out as adults. They talked about a young black girl named Temptress, how she got to be named, and how she ended up court. Were these children just living out their names or was there a bigger factor at play here? A black Harvard professor named Roland G. Fryer Jr. decided to dedicate his life to learning more about it. He looked at where the parents lived, how they paid for their hospital bills, and what their favorite T.V. shows were compared to white parents. They sent in the same resume to different companies with the only difference being names on the resume. The typical white name was more likely to get a call back for an interview. Why? Was it because the interviewer was racist or was it was because that the socioeconomic status of the person who typically had that kind of name tended to not be as reliable? Fryer looked at how likely black parents were to name their kids another popular black name and how likely they would name them something completely different. He looked at the same for white parents. Even among very popular black names, there was little overlap with white. He found that the parent that was most likely to give a child a distinctive black name was an unmarried, low-income, under-educated teenage mother from a black neighborhood who has a distinctively black name herself. Fryer thought it was her choice in solidifying her position with the community. But think about it, how would a black child get treated if it was named something typical white? And think about how you view names when you first hear them? I have to admit I have preconceived notions about names as well. Before I met a member of my husband's family who had two children, I was told their unusual names were because the mother named them using a combination of the mother's and father's names. I immediately asked where they lived, because I wondered if I was going to a bad neighborhood. And I asked if her husband was black. I was right on both accounts, except that she wasn't married. Both of her children were from two different black fathers who were no longer around, and she lived in government housing. So am I racist? Or am I just basing my assumptions on statistics of past experiences? My husband said it was only because I haven't ever really been around black people. I said that wasn't true, I had dated some. He asked me where I had met them, I said college, and he said, well, those don't count, they're different. But why? Because they were educated? Are educated blacks somehow less black because they're educated? I just met black woman at a book club and we immediately hit it off because we both love books and because I found out she home schools her children, something I am doing as well. We immediately made plans to get the kids together. I don't know how educated she is, but she seems intelligent and she obviously cares about education. But is my experience with blacks biased because all the ones I know are educated? I also noticed something else extremely interesting. In Fryer's study, he did surveys and for his sample found the top 20 ""Whitest"" Girl/Boy Names and the top 20 ""Blackest"" Boy/Girl names. I have three boys, and two of their names where on the ""Whitest"" boy names list, and my third, one with a slightly more unusual name, came very close to being called Colin, which was also on this list. Am I unconsciously trying to say something about my children? Or have I unconsciously realized the success rate correlation in names and was hoping they would be more successful due to their names? I honestly don't know. I just find the whole topic fascinating. But I hope I haven't opened up a can of worms. More than likely if anyone reads this whole review I'll undoubtedly offend someone. I've never been a very politically correct person and I don't mean to offend, I'm just a naturally curious person who wants to understand more about the world. This subject has come up in our home recently as well, because I've been teaching my 5-yr-old about Martin Luther King Day. We've had worksheets and lessons about it, and I've had to find ways to describe slavery that my son would understand. Then I started to wonder. Am I teaching this the correct way? Will his curious mind, perhaps like mine, say something one day to offend? But I have no close black friends to ask. I want to know. What do black people want us to know? Should we always use the term African American? What do they want us to teach our kids about MLK? How do we change the misconceptions in culture? Maybe if I end up becoming good friends with this woman I met, I can ask her. Hopefully she'll be open enough to forgive my ignorance. Well, that was a tangent, but it was started because of this book. I enjoyed this book in parts and in others I was bored. I went for a Bachelor's in Psychology and quit when I only had three classes left to get the degree. I just really didn't enjoy it. I've had to take many classes on the subject of Psychology and statistics. And what people need to remember when reading this book, is that it's just statistics. Levitt and Dubner use the words ""more likely"" and ""less likely"" often for a reason. There is no way to prove direct cause and effect relationship on these topics. When I wrote papers in college for my classes, for every study I found on any topic, inevitably I could find a study proving the opposite or at least something with a different outcome. That being said, that does not mean statistical probability does not have merit. It most certainly does, as long as it's taken with a grain of salt. Knowing that even if A + B might = C, there could possibly be a factor Q, which was not seen or not taken into account. I also noticed some of the references they used for their research was stuff they had written, take that as you will. In the end, it's an entertaining book, and the conclusions Levitt and Dubner draw can account for the popularity of this book. Just the idea that abortion could be linked to the decrease in crime is reason enough to read it. "
561,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,3,"One of the most interesting topics in Freakonomics, is that of bad assumptions in causality. These are made when people consider causality regarding a particular event, and they making assumptions that are affected by factors such as self-interest, prejudice, common sense, etc. The book shows that when the right questions are asked and their answers are searched in a bigger context, some unrelated causes may happen to trigger the original event. An example from the book is how crime rate had fallen in the US during the mid-90’s after years of increasing and contrary to the most predictions. The authors noted that legalizing abortion in 1973, which is totally unrelated to crime, is what mainly led to the fall in crime rate. They argue that most unwanted children who are most likely to have criminal tendencies, were not born anymore because of the said legalization. Most people would assume that crime rate had fallen because of the strong economy or because of new police strategies or whatever. But when you look at the bigger picture, the real chain of events may begin to materialize. The book helps knowing how to differentiate good assumptions from the bad ones. A very helpful tool in this is the study of incentives.People respond to anything according to their incentives. An incentive can range from money to something as vague as inner peace. In the previous example, treasury people will want to believe that a strong economy helped bringing crime rates down. The police chief will most likely convince himself and other people that his new police strategies are the major contributor to the fall. Some may think that God intervened and helped. This may seem a very simple idea, but when it comes to everyday life, everyone’s incentive is not that clear. An example to this is that of real estate agents. The book demonstrates how real-estate agents will in all likelihood convince you to sell your house at a price that they would not approve if they were themselves the owners of your house. Their explanation is quite simple and plausible: When you're the owner of the house, an increase of 10000$ means a mere couple of hundred dollars for the agent, whereas that is not the case when the agent is the owner. I’m not an expert in the field, but I believe that statistical analysis and its implications are not always applicable on the individual level because it cannot make cut and dry conclusions, and we don't like that individually. Maybe it can help us be more observant, but that has significant side effects, with the most probable one being confusion. The authors claim that the book will help people individually, but I think it can be of much help to corporations or groups.Another problem I've realized is the correlation of data, which may lead to contradicting outcomes as happened in this very book. In one study, the authors show that parents with high income are most likely to raise a successful kid. Yet, in another study near the end of the book they show that the parents’ economic status does not affect their child’s success in life at all, since other factors may be at play. I know that in statistics, it is very natural that individual cases may contradict with one another which is something inherent in the nature of statistics, but when entire statistical outcomes contradict, I think the method used can fairly be deemed inefficient. This was much more enjoyable than reliable, except for the last chapter about names which I believe was a total waste of time. I think that rather than providing anything new, the book is a practical training about a much older wisdom, the maxim of Cassius, which was quoted by Cicero: 
Cui bono?

565,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,4,"At a cocktail party you don’t count on quant types to provide much entertainment. In rare cases a data-plying vector-head like me might talk about how some big swinging member at the trade desk got eviscerated when he messed up his numbers. A story like that can be marginally interesting if told in a gory way. But as relatable tidbits go, that had pretty much been the full gamut. Now, with Freakonomics, we dare to dream of audiences appreciating a new set of number-based anecdotes. They came up with examples where their quantitative forensics would yield something clever or fun, often exposing ironic, counterintuitive, or sordid behavior in the process. I suspect the less these examples had to do with economics, the more interesting they seemed. Be that as it may, it was gratifying to see that the modeling techniques quants rely on (like multivariate regression) have been brought to bear to tell these tales.The Freakonomics formula is a smart one. It starts with sound research on non-traditional topics with results that were vetted in academic journals. That was Levitt’s part. Co-author Dubner is the writer. His job was to provide context, explain how results were uncovered, and sell us on why it’s all so cool. And who wouldn’t be at least mildly intrigued by patterns that show how teachers in Chicago cheated to raise their students’ test scores, and how that links them with Sumo wrestlers in Japan. They cited another example discovered in April of ’87. Evidently that year 7 million children in the US simply disappeared off the face of the earth. This was fully one-tenth of the dependent-age population. They speculated that maybe, just maybe, the new requirement from the IRS in ’87 to include a child’s SSN on the form had something to do with the massive decline in dependents.The authors were careful to explain the methodological difficulties in making data confess. Researchers of this stripe are rarely given the luxury of a lab, where one variable at a time can be changed, holding everything else constant. Ceteris is almost never paribus in social science. I give the authors credit, too, for their interpretation of results. For instance, they explained how the old cliché in real estate that your first offer will be your best may have a lot to do with the incentive structures of the seller’s agent. Say they’re slated to get 3% of the sale price. If it’s a matter of getting 0.03 x $300,000 right now and no longer needing to show the home versus holding out for 0.03 x $310,000 at some unknown point in the future, the usual counsel is to take the first offer. They’re only foregoing a potential $300. The homeowners’ incentive is very different. Say they owe the bank $250,000. For them it’s a matter of netting $50,000 or $60,000. Not surprisingly, the data show that realtors selling their own homes keep them on the market for longer and get a higher percentage of the true value.Some of their findings generated controversy. Read their account on the legalization of abortion and subsequent drop in crime rates 20 or so years later if you want an example. They were careful not to engage in moral calculus, but they had to know they were playing with fire. All in all I thought their examples were interesting, but generally not the most important issues we confront today. Still, they may serve a purpose if you’re looking for cocktail party chitchat of a quantitative bent."
566,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,4,"I think I forgot to mention that I finished Freakonomics by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner. I haven’t started the sequel “Superfreakonomics” yet but the first one, well, it started out really interesting but I kind of lost their logic at the end. The book is a collaboration between a “rogue” economist, Levitt, and a writer, Dubner, about trying to discount “common wisdom” and idées reçus with economic analysis and they reach some interesting and also bizarre conclusions. It starts out interesting about cheating which links teachers – perhaps the most interesting study in the book – and sumo wrestlers. The irony here is that in Japan just this year (several years after the publication of the book), the sumo match-fixing has come public and they have even been reduced to giving tickets away for free because the Japanese were so disillusioned with the revelations of corruption and links with the yakuza. Anyway, there are also interesting articles about drug dealers and real estate agents. They also talked about the Klu Klux Klan and mentioned an interesting person, Stetson Kennedy, who infiltrated that organization way back when. What they forgot to mention about him is that he actually ran for president once on an independent ticket for justice – I know that because Billy Bragg and Wilco covered the Woody Guthrie song about Stetson Kennedy on their Mermaid Avenue album (an absolute must if you don’t have it!). Then you hit the controversial section where they blame the sudden drop of crime in the 90s to abortion. I suppose that they could be right and the hypothesis is certainly interesting but I think they were going more for shock value than literary or economic value in the “1 baby equals 8 abortions” – at least I couldn’t really see where they wanted to go with that. Towards the end also, I felt that it starts to wander a bit. I didn’t know what the point they wanted to make actually was in belittling the names that african-americans give to their kids and couldn’t really see the link they were trying to make with grades and stuff. While it is a fascinating read – particularly the first three chapters – the end was a bit, well, confusing to be honest. I hope that Superfreakonomics will keep a more even rhythm. OK so enough blather. I think Burn Notice might be the funnier alternative here with perhaps a dose of Episodes or Shameless thrown in. Enjoy your weekend, dear reader"

568,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve,4,"This was a reread in preparation for a professional development workshop being conducted in my office. I don't remember when I first read it, but it had to have been shortly after the book was originally published in 2005/2006. I'm sticking with my original rating of four stars.The book is well-written and has all the data you can imagine to back up the authors' claims. One area it fails at, however, is that the areas they are trying to tie together really have no relationship. I mean, Chicago teachers and sumo wrestlers don't have much in common, and there isn't a strong correlation between the two. Sure, they may cheat, but the ""whys"" are vastly different.The one thing I was interested in finding for my workshop is the analysis of the data. Data can show almost anything if you look at it long enough. My job requires a lot of data analysis and asking questions, lots of questions. In this respect, the chapter about the young researcher living with the drug dealers appealed to me simply because he started asking questions instead of relying on the status quo or even wrong concepts. His research changed the views of a lot of politicians, and how they approached the gang/drug problem around the country.I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in data analysis and asking, ""Why?""."

For the most part they also do not repetitively reiterate their points, though the last chapter on names was a bit long in the tooth (otherwise the book would have scored higher). I'm interested in reading other books by the author duo and hope they continue to keep tackling controversial topics while supporting a new way of looking at old debates. To me, their work is more sensical, intriguing and built upon stronger arguments with less repetition than the more popular author, Malcolm Gladwell. To be fair, I have so far only read one book by each, but it is a clear preference.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Morality, it could be argued, represents the way that people would like the world to work, wheareas economics represents how it actually does work.First Sentence: Anyone living in the United States in the early 1990s and paying even a whisper of attention to the nightly news or a daily paper could be forgiven for having been scared out of his skin."

572,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,3,"Levitt is an original thinker who has an ability to look beneath the obvious, using the tools of his trade, economics. As such he has come up with a diverse range of insights into various social issues, finding connections that are sometimes quite surprising. He shows how many notions taken as common wisdom are anything but. The unexpected results of the legalization of abortion – crime reductionUsing statistics and logic to show how teachers and sumo wrestlers can be shown to cheatWhat is the impact of greater spending in political campaignsThese and other questions, and their examination by Levitt make for an educational, thought-provoking, and eminently entertaining read. P 13Morality, it could be argued, represents the way that people would like the world to work—whereas economics represents how it actually does work. Economics is above all a science of measurement. It compromises an extraordinarily powerful and flexible set of tools that can reliably assess a thicket of information to determine the effect of any one factor, or even the whole effect. That’s what “the economy” is, after all: a thicket of information about jobs and real estate and banking and investment. But the tools of economics can be just as easily applied to subjects that are more—well, more interesting. This book, then, has been written from a very specific worldview, based on a few fundamental ideas:	Incentives are the cornerstone of modern life. And understanding them—or, often, ferreting them out—is the key to solving just about any riddle, from violent crime to sports cheating to online dating. 	The conventional wisdom is often wrong. Crime didn’t keep soaring in the 1990s, money alone doesn’t win elections, and—surprise—drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health. 	Dramatic effects often have distant, even subtle, causes. 	Experts—from criminologists to real-estate agents—use their informational advantage to serve their own agendaP 71Armed with information, experts can exert a gigantic, if unspoken, leverage, fear. Fear that your children will find you dead on the bathroom floor of a heart attack if you do not have angioplasty surgery. Fear that a cheap casket will expose your grandmother to a terrible underground fate. Fear that a $25,000 car will crumple like a toy in an accident, whereas a $50,000 car will wrap your loved ones in a cocoon of impregnable steel. The fear created by commercial experts may not quite rival the fear created by terrorists like the Ku Klux Klan, but the principle is the sameP 155…nature-nurture discrepancies were addressed in a 1998 book by a little-known textbook author named Judith Rich Harris. The Nurture Assumption was in effect an attack on obsessive parenting, a book so provocative that it required two subtitles Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do and Parents Matter Much Less Than You Think and Peers Matter More. Harris argued, albeit gently, that parents are wrong to think that they contribute so mightily to their child’s personality. This belief, she wrote, was a “cultural myth.” Harris argued that the top-down influence of parents is overwhelmed by the grassroots effect of peer pressure, the blunt force applied each day by friends and schoolmates.

573,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88991-mark-desrosiers,2,"The hidden side of everything? Everything? No. Levitt's conclusions about incentives and demographics are fascinating, sure. But I think we should all mistrust an economist who would hitch his wagon to a scribbler on the make (a move that also advertises young Levitt's thirst for fame and lucre). Other superstar economists -- Galbraith or Friedman, for instance -- had a very obvious ideological agenda, and they stated it openly. A superstar beyond his precursors' wildest nightmares, Levitt claims to have no agenda whatsoever, and remains guided by his Bucky-Fuller-esque curiosity and semi-autistic amorality. Or so it seems. I think he'll out himself as a neoliberal, or at least a creepy libertarian, soon enough (maybe he has already? I don't read his blog). No true economic lefty could keep his rep aloft in the current publishing climate for this long, even if his musings are decorated with soulless Social Statics and Revenge of the Nerds style curiosity. Also, damn near everyone calls him ""That Freakonomics Guy,"" while conjuring a Pavlovian drool-drenched image of that Granny Smith Tangerine on the cover. Independent thinker though he may seem, Levitt is obviously the product of brand management now. Until he de-pimps himself from the corporate world, I'd rather listen to Mr. Clean or Tony the Tiger.

574,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"On the whole most of the contents of the book strike me as sociology rather than economics. Interesting in parts, obvious in others (as in the comparison of the structure of a drug dealing network to that of McDonalds) , apparently methodologically unsound in places, a curate's egg.The major problem is the difficulty the authors have in escaping the gravity of their own biases which then pull them in certain directions. For example the case of fraud and cheating in Sumo wrestling. Statistically we might be happy with the authors' report that after a certain point in competitions fairly fought bouts were not occurring, but that does not prove their claim that money was changing hands. It seems more than a little cheeky to describe one of the authors as a rogue economist when his rogueishness consists not of wayward or distinctive thinking but mostly in commentating upon the work of other researchers. Derivative, moderately entertaining. Take well salted."

I think he tried to tie that into the economy somewhere, but don't ask me to find where.I kept thinking the book would get better. It didn't. His points became more and more bizarre as I progressed.

If you appreciate counter-intuitive thinking and value approaches to discovering what's ACTUALLY true rather than what ""common sense"" tells us is true, then you will greatly appreciate Steven Levitt's methods. If you're after directly practical knowledge only, you will not value this much. If you are big into strictly traditional thinking, you will HATE this. Be ready to separate what you believe to be moral from what actually happens (they don't always agree, even when I don't like it). So assess yourself and decide accordingly. If you want to know interesting truths and value things that are counter-intuitive even when it flies in the face of a deeply held belief, this is for you. Dr. Levitt's approach is so refreshing; ignoring what seems to be true and always wondering what actually is true, then leveraging data he finds to discover what it can reveal (not what he wants, not what you or I want, but what actually IS). He's a refreshing oddball that I wish I could know personally so I would gain more of that fresh look."

This will not be a comprehensive review. So.My feelings, in summary:*Mostly this was a fun way to apply statistics and math to real life. *Since the book is now fourteen years old and a lot of it hinges on current cultural norms and references, it doesn't age as well as other books might. I know there was more than this, but the one that stood out in my head was the way he treated rape statistics. (Of course, I remember nothing about the way he treated them, only that it felt wrong to me.)*There was something in here about realtors? It made me very suspicious to buy property. Also I don't want to buy property because I like having people come fix things for me.*There was something else in here about gangs and a researcher embedded with them? I don't remember the significance.*This might be the worst review I have ever written.It made for a good audiobook, though!

But the scientist and statistician and academic in me was completely horrified-- this is a one-sided discussion of Levitt's ideas, which a brief glance at the internet tells me have in some cases been disputed in-depth in the economic literature. Many of the cases that claimed to be ""simple questions"" with ""simple answers"", if you just defied conventional wisdom, were improper questions from both a scientific and statistical point of view. Take abortion, which the authors claim reduced crime because ""Unwantedness leads to high crime, abortion leads to less unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime."" A vast simplification on many levels, but it completely simplifies a sociological issue-- what is unwantedness? Is abortion the ONLY means of controlling whether a woman has a child or not? Could you or could you not make the same argument about birth control, and if not, why? The explanations of statistics were laughable-- that statistical analysis is more of an art than a science. No, it is a science, just a manipulable one. The intentional manipulation is not artful, it is dishonest. The treatment of this topic seemed like it was screaming for attention, rather than really trying to understand the topic at hand. I recommend reading this with the same skepticism that the authors recommend for conventional wisdom, which is to say, a lot. I hope, for the sake of the field of economics, that Levitt's scientific writing is much more careful and accurate.If you are looking for a very readable book on economics, I highly recommend ""The Undercover Economist"" instead!"

This is so intuitively wrong and against the obvious opinions of everyone from such moneygrubbers as Karl Rove to every rich contributor to Democrat and Republican candidates that it undermines the rest of the book, which is mostly similar unscientific conjecture."

I think it's lack of a theme (which the authors clearly warn readers about ahead of time) contributed to my overall ""meh"" attitude. Additionally, I found myself yearning for more than just Levitt's observations and findings. For example, simply stating that data shows higher abortion rates yield lower crime rates and then not delving too deeply into the reasons that underlie this phenomena just didn't do it for me. That's an extremely weighty thing to state, regardless of if you have data to back you up or not. I guess I wanted some sociology mixed in with my economics. Alas, Levitt is an economist not a sociologist or political scientist.I also want to add that as someone with an MBA (thus, I took classes on data in grad school and would be fine to never run a regression again despite how interesting it can be) and who works with data at her job, I know firsthand how easy it is to manipulate data. I want to assume that Steven Levitt was completely neutral in his research, but who can really know except for Levitt himself? And, who funded all of his studies? I realize Harvard comped him for some work, but what about his studies on Chicago Public Schools? I find it interesting that a school system would turn over their data to him whenever it was inevitable that he find some questionable (and illegal) things going on. I don't know. Again, I want to assume that he was completely neutral, but spinning data is pretty darn easy. And even assuming he completed his research with no bias, what about the actual data he was working with. Some of the ""perfect parent"" data (I think it was still Chicago Public School data) seemed very subjective. For example, how exactly was ""a lot"" quantified in the the data point regarding ""parents who have a lot of books in their home""*? I have ~200-300 books and don't really consider that ""a lot."" You might disagree which is my entire point. Won't different people quantify and thus answer that question differently? Ok, I'm going too deep into this. Basically, I know first hand that you can tell whatever story you want to with data, so I wonder what approach Levitt took in order to remain unprejudiced and unbiased.And finally, I imagine I wasn't the only one holding their breath while reading over the low income baby names. Not that it means anything, but it was still a bit jarring to hear how a person's name reflects their parents' income. Some of the names were very obviously high or low income names, but it was interesting to hear how many common names have moved back and forth on the different lists over time. That portion of the book was undoubtedly the most interesting, and seemingly the most objective--both from sociological and data standpoints.*might not be the exact wording used, but I listened to the book and thus can't reference the print."
589,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"Is legalizing abortion responsible for the drop in crime rates? First of all this book is not really about economics but turning controversial concepts around and looking at them from a different point of view. Thereby the title is misleading and really doesn’t represent the contentI absolutely liked the concept and the very engaging and compelling writing style of this book, which reminded me enormously of Malcom Gladwell. It‘s written by Levitt who is professor for economics at the university of Chicago and offers you to look at widely spread political perceptions differently.This book caused an extreme amount of noise and criticism, mostly for claiming that the legalization of abortion caused the 1990s crime drop. Also you learn about how teachers falsify their students test scores to benefit themselfes, how children superman stories on the radio destroyed the klux klux klan, about the economics of drug dealing, the effect of good parenting on education and how naming your children affects their path.Some criticise Freakonomics arguing that it would contain large, impactful claims without providing enough references or just those who benefit the thesis. But from a different point of view it simply can be seen as offering a thought provoking analysis, which is a road I choose to go. I‘m not a reader who ""believes"" every statistic or hypothesis presented to me without reflection , but always think for myself.I absolutely enjoyed reading it, it’s extremely entertaining while offering a different view on the world. Alone the approach to look at every aspect in life from different perspectives makes this worth reading! I recommend this book to anyone who loves nonfiction.Very provocative and full of great insights, I see why this was a New York Times bestseller."
590,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610433-midnightfaerie,3,"Freakonomics by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner didn't impress me as much as I thought it would. A book about economics and finding correlations in things you wouldn't necessarily surmise, Levitt and Dubner seem to be really arguing that the defining indicator behind these studies is incentive. Perhaps it's my background in Psychology, but a lot of this seemed common sense to me. There were some parts I really enjoyed though. The two chapters I found to be the most interesting out of the whole book, were two towards the end. The chapter on What makes a good parent (i.e. What factors of the parent affect the child's success in life?) and A Roshanda by Any Other Name (i.e. Is black culture a cause of racial inequality or is it a consequence?). The chapter on parenting is interesting, and in some ways, not too surprising. Kids that have a lot of books in their home tend to do better in school. Kids born of a low birth weight tend to not do as well. If we think about it, a parent with lots of books cares about and might be more invested in their child's education than one without books, which of course, would lead to the child having better test scores. If we think about it, the child with the low birth weight is probably one with a teenage mother or one who doesn't take of herself as much, maybe a smoker or drinker, thus leading us to believe that she doesn't care about the child as much either. Some of the other factors they looked at that I found interesting were whether the child was adopted, whether the mother was over 30 when she had the child, whether the child went to HeadStart, whether the child frequently watched television, whether the child was spanked, and if the parents were involved with PTA. Some of the results were surprising. I won't give them all away, but they were always what you might expect. The chapter about racial inequality relating to names that parents give their children I found fascinating. They talked about a father who named one son Loser and one son Winner and how they turned out as adults. They talked about a young black girl named Temptress, how she got to be named, and how she ended up court. Were these children just living out their names or was there a bigger factor at play here? A black Harvard professor named Roland G. Fryer Jr. decided to dedicate his life to learning more about it. He looked at where the parents lived, how they paid for their hospital bills, and what their favorite T.V. shows were compared to white parents. They sent in the same resume to different companies with the only difference being names on the resume. The typical white name was more likely to get a call back for an interview. Why? Was it because the interviewer was racist or was it was because that the socioeconomic status of the person who typically had that kind of name tended to not be as reliable? Fryer looked at how likely black parents were to name their kids another popular black name and how likely they would name them something completely different. He looked at the same for white parents. Even among very popular black names, there was little overlap with white. He found that the parent that was most likely to give a child a distinctive black name was an unmarried, low-income, under-educated teenage mother from a black neighborhood who has a distinctively black name herself. Fryer thought it was her choice in solidifying her position with the community. But think about it, how would a black child get treated if it was named something typical white? And think about how you view names when you first hear them? I have to admit I have preconceived notions about names as well. Before I met a member of my husband's family who had two children, I was told their unusual names were because the mother named them using a combination of the mother's and father's names. I immediately asked where they lived, because I wondered if I was going to a bad neighborhood. And I asked if her husband was black. I was right on both accounts, except that she wasn't married. Both of her children were from two different black fathers who were no longer around, and she lived in government housing. So am I racist? Or am I just basing my assumptions on statistics of past experiences? My husband said it was only because I haven't ever really been around black people. I said that wasn't true, I had dated some. He asked me where I had met them, I said college, and he said, well, those don't count, they're different. But why? Because they were educated? Are educated blacks somehow less black because they're educated? I just met black woman at a book club and we immediately hit it off because we both love books and because I found out she home schools her children, something I am doing as well. We immediately made plans to get the kids together. I don't know how educated she is, but she seems intelligent and she obviously cares about education. But is my experience with blacks biased because all the ones I know are educated? I also noticed something else extremely interesting. In Fryer's study, he did surveys and for his sample found the top 20 ""Whitest"" Girl/Boy Names and the top 20 ""Blackest"" Boy/Girl names. I have three boys, and two of their names where on the ""Whitest"" boy names list, and my third, one with a slightly more unusual name, came very close to being called Colin, which was also on this list. Am I unconsciously trying to say something about my children? Or have I unconsciously realized the success rate correlation in names and was hoping they would be more successful due to their names? I honestly don't know. I just find the whole topic fascinating. But I hope I haven't opened up a can of worms. More than likely if anyone reads this whole review I'll undoubtedly offend someone. I've never been a very politically correct person and I don't mean to offend, I'm just a naturally curious person who wants to understand more about the world. This subject has come up in our home recently as well, because I've been teaching my 5-yr-old about Martin Luther King Day. We've had worksheets and lessons about it, and I've had to find ways to describe slavery that my son would understand. Then I started to wonder. Am I teaching this the correct way? Will his curious mind, perhaps like mine, say something one day to offend? But I have no close black friends to ask. I want to know. What do black people want us to know? Should we always use the term African American? What do they want us to teach our kids about MLK? How do we change the misconceptions in culture? Maybe if I end up becoming good friends with this woman I met, I can ask her. Hopefully she'll be open enough to forgive my ignorance. Well, that was a tangent, but it was started because of this book. I enjoyed this book in parts and in others I was bored. I went for a Bachelor's in Psychology and quit when I only had three classes left to get the degree. I just really didn't enjoy it. I've had to take many classes on the subject of Psychology and statistics. And what people need to remember when reading this book, is that it's just statistics. Levitt and Dubner use the words ""more likely"" and ""less likely"" often for a reason. There is no way to prove direct cause and effect relationship on these topics. When I wrote papers in college for my classes, for every study I found on any topic, inevitably I could find a study proving the opposite or at least something with a different outcome. That being said, that does not mean statistical probability does not have merit. It most certainly does, as long as it's taken with a grain of salt. Knowing that even if A + B might = C, there could possibly be a factor Q, which was not seen or not taken into account. I also noticed some of the references they used for their research was stuff they had written, take that as you will. In the end, it's an entertaining book, and the conclusions Levitt and Dubner draw can account for the popularity of this book. Just the idea that abortion could be linked to the decrease in crime is reason enough to read it. "
591,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,3,"One of the most interesting topics in Freakonomics, is that of bad assumptions in causality. These are made when people consider causality regarding a particular event, and they making assumptions that are affected by factors such as self-interest, prejudice, common sense, etc. The book shows that when the right questions are asked and their answers are searched in a bigger context, some unrelated causes may happen to trigger the original event. An example from the book is how crime rate had fallen in the US during the mid-90’s after years of increasing and contrary to the most predictions. The authors noted that legalizing abortion in 1973, which is totally unrelated to crime, is what mainly led to the fall in crime rate. They argue that most unwanted children who are most likely to have criminal tendencies, were not born anymore because of the said legalization. Most people would assume that crime rate had fallen because of the strong economy or because of new police strategies or whatever. But when you look at the bigger picture, the real chain of events may begin to materialize. The book helps knowing how to differentiate good assumptions from the bad ones. A very helpful tool in this is the study of incentives.People respond to anything according to their incentives. An incentive can range from money to something as vague as inner peace. In the previous example, treasury people will want to believe that a strong economy helped bringing crime rates down. The police chief will most likely convince himself and other people that his new police strategies are the major contributor to the fall. Some may think that God intervened and helped. This may seem a very simple idea, but when it comes to everyday life, everyone’s incentive is not that clear. An example to this is that of real estate agents. The book demonstrates how real-estate agents will in all likelihood convince you to sell your house at a price that they would not approve if they were themselves the owners of your house. Their explanation is quite simple and plausible: When you're the owner of the house, an increase of 10000$ means a mere couple of hundred dollars for the agent, whereas that is not the case when the agent is the owner. I’m not an expert in the field, but I believe that statistical analysis and its implications are not always applicable on the individual level because it cannot make cut and dry conclusions, and we don't like that individually. Maybe it can help us be more observant, but that has significant side effects, with the most probable one being confusion. The authors claim that the book will help people individually, but I think it can be of much help to corporations or groups.Another problem I've realized is the correlation of data, which may lead to contradicting outcomes as happened in this very book. In one study, the authors show that parents with high income are most likely to raise a successful kid. Yet, in another study near the end of the book they show that the parents’ economic status does not affect their child’s success in life at all, since other factors may be at play. I know that in statistics, it is very natural that individual cases may contradict with one another which is something inherent in the nature of statistics, but when entire statistical outcomes contradict, I think the method used can fairly be deemed inefficient. This was much more enjoyable than reliable, except for the last chapter about names which I believe was a total waste of time. I think that rather than providing anything new, the book is a practical training about a much older wisdom, the maxim of Cassius, which was quoted by Cicero: 
Cui bono?

595,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,4,"At a cocktail party you don’t count on quant types to provide much entertainment. In rare cases a data-plying vector-head like me might talk about how some big swinging member at the trade desk got eviscerated when he messed up his numbers. A story like that can be marginally interesting if told in a gory way. But as relatable tidbits go, that had pretty much been the full gamut. Now, with Freakonomics, we dare to dream of audiences appreciating a new set of number-based anecdotes. They came up with examples where their quantitative forensics would yield something clever or fun, often exposing ironic, counterintuitive, or sordid behavior in the process. I suspect the less these examples had to do with economics, the more interesting they seemed. Be that as it may, it was gratifying to see that the modeling techniques quants rely on (like multivariate regression) have been brought to bear to tell these tales.The Freakonomics formula is a smart one. It starts with sound research on non-traditional topics with results that were vetted in academic journals. That was Levitt’s part. Co-author Dubner is the writer. His job was to provide context, explain how results were uncovered, and sell us on why it’s all so cool. And who wouldn’t be at least mildly intrigued by patterns that show how teachers in Chicago cheated to raise their students’ test scores, and how that links them with Sumo wrestlers in Japan. They cited another example discovered in April of ’87. Evidently that year 7 million children in the US simply disappeared off the face of the earth. This was fully one-tenth of the dependent-age population. They speculated that maybe, just maybe, the new requirement from the IRS in ’87 to include a child’s SSN on the form had something to do with the massive decline in dependents.The authors were careful to explain the methodological difficulties in making data confess. Researchers of this stripe are rarely given the luxury of a lab, where one variable at a time can be changed, holding everything else constant. Ceteris is almost never paribus in social science. I give the authors credit, too, for their interpretation of results. For instance, they explained how the old cliché in real estate that your first offer will be your best may have a lot to do with the incentive structures of the seller’s agent. Say they’re slated to get 3% of the sale price. If it’s a matter of getting 0.03 x $300,000 right now and no longer needing to show the home versus holding out for 0.03 x $310,000 at some unknown point in the future, the usual counsel is to take the first offer. They’re only foregoing a potential $300. The homeowners’ incentive is very different. Say they owe the bank $250,000. For them it’s a matter of netting $50,000 or $60,000. Not surprisingly, the data show that realtors selling their own homes keep them on the market for longer and get a higher percentage of the true value.Some of their findings generated controversy. Read their account on the legalization of abortion and subsequent drop in crime rates 20 or so years later if you want an example. They were careful not to engage in moral calculus, but they had to know they were playing with fire. All in all I thought their examples were interesting, but generally not the most important issues we confront today. Still, they may serve a purpose if you’re looking for cocktail party chitchat of a quantitative bent."
596,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,4,"I think I forgot to mention that I finished Freakonomics by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner. I haven’t started the sequel “Superfreakonomics” yet but the first one, well, it started out really interesting but I kind of lost their logic at the end. The book is a collaboration between a “rogue” economist, Levitt, and a writer, Dubner, about trying to discount “common wisdom” and idées reçus with economic analysis and they reach some interesting and also bizarre conclusions. It starts out interesting about cheating which links teachers – perhaps the most interesting study in the book – and sumo wrestlers. The irony here is that in Japan just this year (several years after the publication of the book), the sumo match-fixing has come public and they have even been reduced to giving tickets away for free because the Japanese were so disillusioned with the revelations of corruption and links with the yakuza. Anyway, there are also interesting articles about drug dealers and real estate agents. They also talked about the Klu Klux Klan and mentioned an interesting person, Stetson Kennedy, who infiltrated that organization way back when. What they forgot to mention about him is that he actually ran for president once on an independent ticket for justice – I know that because Billy Bragg and Wilco covered the Woody Guthrie song about Stetson Kennedy on their Mermaid Avenue album (an absolute must if you don’t have it!). Then you hit the controversial section where they blame the sudden drop of crime in the 90s to abortion. I suppose that they could be right and the hypothesis is certainly interesting but I think they were going more for shock value than literary or economic value in the “1 baby equals 8 abortions” – at least I couldn’t really see where they wanted to go with that. Towards the end also, I felt that it starts to wander a bit. I didn’t know what the point they wanted to make actually was in belittling the names that african-americans give to their kids and couldn’t really see the link they were trying to make with grades and stuff. While it is a fascinating read – particularly the first three chapters – the end was a bit, well, confusing to be honest. I hope that Superfreakonomics will keep a more even rhythm. OK so enough blather. I think Burn Notice might be the funnier alternative here with perhaps a dose of Episodes or Shameless thrown in. Enjoy your weekend, dear reader"

598,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve,4,"This was a reread in preparation for a professional development workshop being conducted in my office. I don't remember when I first read it, but it had to have been shortly after the book was originally published in 2005/2006. I'm sticking with my original rating of four stars.The book is well-written and has all the data you can imagine to back up the authors' claims. One area it fails at, however, is that the areas they are trying to tie together really have no relationship. I mean, Chicago teachers and sumo wrestlers don't have much in common, and there isn't a strong correlation between the two. Sure, they may cheat, but the ""whys"" are vastly different.The one thing I was interested in finding for my workshop is the analysis of the data. Data can show almost anything if you look at it long enough. My job requires a lot of data analysis and asking questions, lots of questions. In this respect, the chapter about the young researcher living with the drug dealers appealed to me simply because he started asking questions instead of relying on the status quo or even wrong concepts. His research changed the views of a lot of politicians, and how they approached the gang/drug problem around the country.I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in data analysis and asking, ""Why?""."

For the most part they also do not repetitively reiterate their points, though the last chapter on names was a bit long in the tooth (otherwise the book would have scored higher). I'm interested in reading other books by the author duo and hope they continue to keep tackling controversial topics while supporting a new way of looking at old debates. To me, their work is more sensical, intriguing and built upon stronger arguments with less repetition than the more popular author, Malcolm Gladwell. To be fair, I have so far only read one book by each, but it is a clear preference.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Morality, it could be argued, represents the way that people would like the world to work, wheareas economics represents how it actually does work.First Sentence: Anyone living in the United States in the early 1990s and paying even a whisper of attention to the nightly news or a daily paper could be forgiven for having been scared out of his skin."

And I am thus indebted to such an extent, that I can confess to arriving early for any flight departing from an airport with a bookstore for the sole purpose of securing a few additional minutes to browse books. If it were not for the practicalities of travelling, I would probably have bought this book much sooner than I did for I had been securing extra minutes in airport bookstores just to read through another chapter long before I actually bought it.You see, my travels are laden with a heavy debate: shall I pack my extra suitcase with books or groceries? I resolve this by alternating. For one trip to the Outside, a spare duffel bag will be dedicated to books and I will shun all opportunities to visit grocery stores just to preserve that determination. On the next visit, I will carry a spare cooler (rather than duffel bag) and splurge on leg of lamb and cheeses free of artificial coloring. The ultimate effect of this system, however, is a backlog in possessing the books I'd like to read.Finally, however, the fates aligned. I was travelling to Iowa on what I expected to be a gloriously grocery-focused trip. But my cooler broke as I was carrying it to the truck that we would drive to our local airport. There wasn't time to fix it. I was sad, of course, as I had been anticipating all the pork I was going to return with from Iowa. But I consoled myself with all those Iowa cookbooks I could now carry, and resolved not to prolong any lamentations over the cooler. And, oh, did I find myself lugging around a heavy library - such hours did I spend in Powells (there was a 1 week layover in Oregon) and Iowa City's bookstores. The day before we left Iowa, Nate told me about how much he enjoyed this book. His description renewed my interest, and I committed myself to buying a copy before we left. But, alas, we ran out of time. We didn't make it to a bookstore. It was sadder than the last-minute loss of the cooler. So when we arrived in Chicago, and had a few minutes to wait for the connecting flight to Alaska, and our gate was right next to a book kiosk, and I was pretty sure there was just enough room in my carry-on to squeeze in one more book - it was this book that I grabbed. I raced through it. Loving each chapter. I really can't recommend it enough. A fun read, for those who like to be entertained by books. Informative too, for those that like to read for knowledge, thought, and/or discourse. But what elevates it to favorite is that it alters perception and challenges assumptions. For what it's worth, I have no regrets that I carried this book rather than Iowa pork.....and I can think of no finer testament to a good book. Then again, most of my entertainment these days revolves around pickling turnips. So if turnips aren't your thing, feel free to take my recommendation with a grain of salt....but you should still read this book."

DubnerFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything is the debut non-fiction book by University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and New York Times journalist Stephen J. Dubner. It was published on April 12, 2005, by William Morrow. The book has been described as melding pop culture with economics. By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide. The book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by ""traditional"" economists. In Freakonomics, Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of incentives. The book's chapters cover:Chapter 1: Discovering cheating as applied to teachers and sumo wrestlers, as well as a typical Washington, D.C.–area bagel business and its customersChapter 2: Information control as applied to the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agentsChapter 3: The economics of drug dealing, including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealersChapter 4: The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime, contrasted with the policies and downfall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled ""The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime,"" written with John Donohue.)Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good parenting on educationChapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children (nominative determinism)تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه آگوست سال 2008 میلادیعنوان: اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های پنهان اجتماعی؛ نویسنده: استیون لویت، استپان‌ دابنر؛ مترجم: سعید مشیری؛ تهران: نشر نی‏‫، 1386؛ در 269 ص؛ شابک: 9789643129507؛ چاپ دوم 1392؛ موضوع: اقتصاد از نویسندگان امریکایی - جنبه های روانشناسی - سده 21 معنوان: اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها؛ نویسنده: استیون دی‌. لویت؛ مترجم: امیرحسین توکلی؛ تهران: سبزان‏‫، 1385؛ در 197 ص؛ شابک: 9789648249674؛ عنوان روی جلد: اقتصاد علم انگیزه‌ها: مهارت‌های لازم برای کشف ابعاد پنهان پدیده‌ها؛‬کتاب «فریکونومیکس» در باره ی اقتصاد، از اقتصاددان دانشگاه شیکاگو «استیون لویت» است، که نخستین بار در روز دوازدهم ماه آوریل سال 2005 میلادی منتشر شد. این کتاب تا پایان سال 2009 میلادی، بیش از چهار میلیون نسخه فروش داشته است. کتاب با عنوان «اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های اجتماعی» توسط نشر نی و با ترجمه ی جناب «سعید مشیری»، و با عنوان: «اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها»؛ با ترجمه ی جناب «امیرحسین توکلی»، منتشر شده است. کتاب چندین فصل دارد: درباره حقه زدن در شغل‌هایی مانند معلمی و کشتی‌گیران سومو؛ شباهت‌های کوکلوس‌کلان‌ و افراد معاملات ملکی؛ سیستم اقتصادی کارتل‌های مواد مخدر؛ تاثیر قانونی‌سازی سقط جنین در کاهش جرایم چندین سال بعد؛ نقش بسیار کم تربیت خوب کودکان توسط والدین در بهتر شدن آموزش و پرورششان؛ و الگوهای نامگذاری کودکان در یک جامعه. ا. شربیانی"
607,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249257-elise,3,"Levitt makes the lofty claim that economics is not swayed by moral sensibilities - it's a pure numbers game of course! However, not knowing much about him beyond his affiliation with the University of Chicago and what was written in the book, I can surmise that he is conservative, or at least what today would be inappropriately labeled ""moderate."" Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily...or at least I don't view it that way. Does it affect his conclusions? Absolutely. Levitt assumes his assertion that Roe v. Wade is responsible for the drop in crime experienced in the 1990s is the most controversial in the book, but I was not bothered by that conclusion at all. What did raise my ire a bit was his statement that ""Minorities commit more crimes."" Perhaps the pure numbers seem to show so, but upon closer examination and more careful thought, one might conclude that minorities are simply arrested and convicted more often. In many cases, Levitt does delve into the deeper ""behind the scenes"" reasons for why things happen, but in this glaring example, he delves no further than to admit that poverty might have a link to crime commission, and with more minorities in poverty more of them commit crimes. Might it also have a link to crime conviction? The white suburban kid who can afford a long and arduous defense, or whose father knows someone who can get the kid out of a jam, has a much better chance of having his case dismissed than a poor minority kid assigned a public defender (not to say that public defenders don't do good work - in fact many of them are some of the most amazing lawyers out there). Suffice to say the system is stacked against people in poverty and minorities, and Levitt fails to fully acknowledge this in his discussion of what causes and helps prevent crime. I wasn't so much angry as I was disappointed. When one of the brightest minds in our country can't see beyond his own prejudices, where is the hope for the rest of us? Levitt might be a genius, but he is woefully culturally incompetent. "
608,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/847862-paulius,1,"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (2005)There are intriguing elements in this book but when it comes to the larger picture, I find it sorely lacking. Levitt is a young star in the economics profession who enjoys playing games with interesting questions. For example, he assembles data to demonstrate that Roe v. Wade was critical to the drop in the crime rate in the 90s. On p. 125 he notes ""So it wasn't capital punishment that drove crime down, nor was it the booming economy. But higher rates of imprisonment did have a lot to do with it."" Also, on p. 139, he says ""Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness, unwantedness leads to high crime, legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime."" He also addresses the old nature vs. nurture argument or environment vs. genetics when he says, on pp. 175-176, ""Parents who are well educated, successful, and healthy tend to have children who test well in school, but it doesn't seem to much matter whether a child is trotted off to museums or spanked or sent to Head Start....The reality is that technique looks to be highly overrated....adopted children test relatively poorly in school, any influence the adoptive parents might exert is seemingly outweighed by the force of genetics. But...the parents were not powerless forever. By the time the adopted children bacame adults, they had veered sharply from the destiny that IQ alone might have predicted. Compared to similar children who were not put up for adoption, the adoptees were far more likely to attend college, to have a well-paid job, and to wait until they were out of their teens before getting married."" Despite these insights, I would never want to write a book like this because it doesn't go after the betterment of the human condition in a broad sense in the fashion that Adam Smith tried with Wealth of Nations in 1776. Levitt may be rewarded for his fun puzzles by a best-seller, but does any of this really help society toward healthier, happier families in the future?"
609,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4047121-william-moore,1,"Freakonomics: a rogue economist – Is that all there is?The title of Freakonomics tells us that Steven Levitt is a “rogue economist” exploring the “the hidden side of everything.” I have always been up for a rogue telling me about everything. Even a rogue telling me about anything appeals to me; you know that special insight that only a mischievous, perhaps unprincipled, but somehow likeable person has. From the title I even conjured up some noble rogue elephant tearing apart the civilized world after suffering a loss of habitat. I was up for rogue. Economics, I thought, is a damn good place for a rogue.Levitt is an economics professor at the University of Chicago and a winner of the John Bates Clark Medal. That medal is awarded every two years to the best economist under 40. It is given by the American Economic Association. If you know anything about this Vanderbilt University supported organization, it wouldn’t be for their search for rogues (although they got Milton Friedman right in 1951.)Steven Levitt is best-known for his findings on America’s falling crime-rate during the 1990s. Teenage murder rates were predicted to double. Instead they fell by more than 50% in the space of five years. By 2000 they were at their lowest in 35 years. But why? Well, a lot of people were taking the credit. They were citing economic growth, gun control, policing, imprisonment and even the death penalty as the reason. Levitt proved the cause as Roe vs Wade, the Supreme Court decision that lead to the repeal of abortion laws in the US. His research showed that children born into impoverished environments were more likely to grow up to become criminals. His analysis formed the elegant but uncomfortable syllogism: “Unwantedness leads to high crime; abortion leads to less unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime.”Levitt is saying, according to Dubner, that incentives and motivations are intimately linked in driving human behaviour. No breakthrough – my mum knew that! He does come through with some interesting proofs. His ingenious methods of analysing data reveal sometimes startling conclusions: Chicago public school teachers were helping their students cheat on state exams; Sumo wrestlers were fixing some of their matches; real-estate agents don’t really care about how much they sell your house for – only their own house, and my favourite; dope-dealers rarely make a good living. These results do amuse, surprise and even educate. In all these conclusions there is a haunting. Strangely, within these intriguing anomalies we never find that superbly-skilled rogue practitioner of economics. Instead we are left with a peppy little repertoire of cocktail chatter (beer-chat for me) and little else.Something went wrong in the writing of Freakonomics. In the reading there was the echo of Mark Twain’s comment that golf was “a good walk spoiled.” Yes it is provocative and interesting but it has a problem. If Malcolm Gladwell of Tipping Point fame says “Steven Levitt has the most interesting mind in America . . .” then the problem is uncompromisingly simple – we can’t find Levitt or his mind in this book!Without question we can find – actually, we can’t get away from – the other Stephen, Stephen Dubner. He is Levitt’s coauthor and a contributor to the New York Times. Dubner occasionally genuflects to Levitt’s genius, to his unique insight, and treats us to the odd passing anecdote. For most of the book though he relies on the coattails of Levitt to spin his own story.Dubner just doesn’t get Levitt. A flaw, especially given the hype in the title. He tells us that this very special economist is challenging the established lens through which we see conventional economics. The problem is what is conventional is never argued and the nature of the difference is never revealed. This new lens, we are told, uncovers – no exposes – the patterns of conventional thinking. These come by way of conclusive moments, end points really, that are sometimes remarkably fascinating and clearly capture interest. The question is, are these moments, this shopping-list of results, the only point of the book?Although Steven Levitt is apparently (or even paradoxically) the coauthor, he never actually appears. Not only is he not there but his methodology is never fully presented nor explained. Malcolm Gladwell goes on to say “. . . and reading Freakonomics is like going for a leisurely walk with him on a sunny summer day, as he waves his fingers in the air and turns everything you once thought to be true inside out.” Well the problem is we never get to go on that walk with Steven Levitt. He just might be nearby, but you never know for sure.The book is a first-person telling by Dubner. So it leaves Dubner responsible for that walk. It also leaves him responsible for the non-telling of either process or personality. It is an issue of depth. His preamble, along with the very bad An Explanatory Note are ill-chosen attempts at building an arcane, deified and mystical Steven Levitt. When we get into the book, we think we are going to meet Levitt, this “rogue economist” – but we never do.Dubner continually misses the mark. He let a good book and a great opportunity slip away. This is because he thinks the mark is simply some captivating Levitt conclusion. Even though I found myself relishing some of these points and was more than willing to tell these little tidbits to my friends; they leave forever undone some important thinking.The success of the book is that each story is portable. In their portability there is a weakness. If the point is, each story is an indicator of how we can mis-see the world, then how do we understand mis-seeing or recognise mis-telling? The only way to know would be to understand Levitt, economics, and the processes by which we make conventional and sometimes remarkably wrong conclusions.We never do. Instead, in each story there is an echo of missed opportunity. In each he takes us on some short walk on how we might see the world. The trouble is it is only a short walk with no critical path to understand how we got there or just where we might be going.Dubner tells us early on that when the publisher approached Steven Levitt, Levitt didn’t want to write a book. He finally did agree to write it, but along with Dubner who had done a story about him for the Times. So Dubner and the brilliant Levitt agree to coauthor. Freakonomics is the result of that division of labour. Presumably Levitt’s job was to continue mining of the reality of the “hidden side of everything.” Then what was Stephen Dubner’s job? The answer: The weaver of these disparate stories; the interpreter; the pattern-finder – the writer! Unfortunately a substantive telling never happens. It takes about half the book to slowly realize Dubner doesn’t really get Levitt – and neither do we.In the end this book bizarrely peters off into some kind of parenting manual. This is presumably because Dubner and Levitt are young fathers. Who knows? Dubner then thinks he can put Humpty back together by saying in the Epilogue that there is “no unifying theme” in Freakonomics. Well he got that right! Here he is alluding to a quote by the philosopher Robert Nozick where Nozick said that at 26 Levitt didn’t need a “unifying theme” as an economist. This may be right for a young economist – but it is not necessarily true of a book.Dubner’s patchwork attempt at an ending only exacerbates the reality of missed opportunity. Unfortunately it causes Freakonomics to read a bit like: What my really important really smart friend did on his summer vacation.William Moore"

Something like ""freakostatistics"" would make much more sense as the name of the book.2. in the introduction, the writers warn us that correlation does not imply causality. OK, agreed. But the rest of the book is just that: THEY act as if correlation and causality are the same thing (but they just have more ""fun"" explanation for stuff). What exactly is their proof that they are not ""inventing explanations"" based on correlation, without any real evidence of causation?This book is just a pile of interesting nonsense.EDIT (2016): There is another thing in the authors' arguments that really bother me (besides the ""correlation vs causality"" debate). The authors' approach to economics is that economics is all about how incentives play out. While incentives are no doubt important in human behaviour, this is an extremely shallow way of talking about economics. It is also very consistent with ""unfettered free market"" ideology, which says that the best way to organize society is through profit incentive. This is a dangerous proposition (as we have seen in 2008) and scientifically very doubtful."

The worst part was definitely his sweeping assumptions and conclusions based on his oh-so-reliable data. He thinks he can get away with this because the preface of the book says that he doesn't come to any conclusions--just asking questions, but the writing SUGGESTS conclusions. Just look at the subtitle, ""the Hidden Side of Everything."" He manipulates the reader into thinking there are connections between things by placing the data and a possible explanation on the same page. The problem with those explanations is that there is no scientific approach. Most of his data are purely observational--which is inherently flawed when trying to find cause and effect. I think the book started off wrong when the so-called economist claimed that he didn't like calculus. I'm not sure how you can call yourself an economist without calculus... Maybe you can't... and maybe that's why this book doesn't work."

Avoid if you possibly can."
615,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17533257-jesse-lehrer,1,"The overarching point of this book is absolutely correct: conventional wisdom and what we perceive to be logical often is not. Our society is wrapped up and smothered in incorrect, dysfunctional assumptions that continue to rule our world and ruin our lives. Bigotry, ignorance, prejudice, fear, and the way people in power use these tools to divide and conquer us is at the root of all of our problems.That being said - everything else in this book is mediocre to bad. The writers make repeated assumptions and statements that are just flat out wrong. They make interesting points, and their comparisons are often thought provoking, but they could have used more of their own medicine.This book is clearly written by economists. Economics is one of the most useless, garbage ideologies ever created by humans. This is, of course, my opinion - but this book, I feel, only serves to prove that opinion. Over and over again the authors try to narrow down causes to one thing or another. They try to find the factor that changed everything. The abortion/crime essay is the clearest - abortion being legal is NOT the only factor that led to crime going down. There are thousands of factors that all contribute to everything that happens. Economists like to boil things down to numbers - instead of looking at people, looking at the complexity of life, they want a simple answer. There are no simple answers.In the book the authors do, occasionally, note that just one thing is not the cause - but they then go back on this again and again by making ridiculous statements, ie:""What sort of woman was most likely to take advantage of Roe v. Wade? Very often she was unmarried or in her teens or poor and sometimes all three."" This sentence gives the image of the typical woman getting an abortion to be a poor teenage girl. They don't say that's the majority, but the implication by choosing this example is that it's the norm. This is absolutely false - Planned Parenthood has plenty of information on this - the most common type of woman who gets an abortion is a woman who has already had a kid(s) and accidentally got pregnant and didn't want another kid. No stereotyping, no images of teenagers making bad choices, etc.Then there's this gem: ""Black Americans were hurt more by crack cocaine than by any other single cause since Jim Crow""I almost stopped reading the book there. That is so wrong, so offensive, so ignorant it is utterly ridiculous. There is NO SINGLE CAUSE of anything! This reductionist economist bullshit is exactly why I hate economics. And if there was a single cause - it wasn't fucking crack. It was racism, or structural racism, or criminalizing of young black people, or economic segregation, or reagonomics, or zoning laws, or re-districting, etc. etc. etc. Crack ruining black communities is, in actuality, a myth. Yes, it's a problem, yes, drug addiction in all forms is terrible, but this myth that crack just fell on black communities like a nuclear bomb leaving nothing behind but violence and death is just plain false. Additionally: the crackdown on drugs came BEFORE crack became an issue - it was a political device pre-dating crack used by Reagan to get votes from ignorant white people who feared black people. There are many books documenting this.In short: there are interesting points in this book, and the overall point is absolutely true. We all fall into believing bullshit that feels like it's obvious but is not. It's up to us individually, and as a society, to always seek the truth. However - the truth is not provided in a 20 page article as a single answer. If only the authors took their own ideas further the book might actually be worth something."
616,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830884-tony-viardo,1,"I was actually quite enthusiastic about reading this book, after having heard all the hype about it, and about Levitt.After I read it, however, I was greatly disappointed.This book is so overrated it's not just funny, it's baffling. To be honest, I really don't see how this author can be taken seriously. This book should be a farce to anyone who has any degree of skeptical thinking; any degree of respect for logic or empirical thought.Leavitt's conclusions are stretched like a rubber chicken (if not shot like one), his correlations are spurious at best, and his conclusions are no more insightful or incisive as what you would hear at a bull session with your friends, sitting around a bar, after knocking back a half dozen brews.Seriously, i really don't get all the hoopla that this title receives. Leavitt's only real talent seems to be collecting lists from public records sources, and then drawing the most asinine conclusions from them, and then writing them up with an ironic tone, just to sound smart. He seems to have accomplished a feat that would make PT Barnum proud... he thought up the most absurd conclusions, passed them off as expert observations, and then by sheer force of will got people to believe him. (You know the saying, ""the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it."")This tripe reminds of ""Who Moved My Cheese"" which was the biggest sham of a marketing snow job ever perpetrated in print, but was somehow widely hailed by business thinkers as a stroke of genius. This happened mainly because the first batch of readers, who got suckered into seriously reading it, didn't want to admit to everyone else that they got suckered into buying (for about 15 bucks) what amounted to bedtime story that any nanny could have come up with on the spot. So they proceeded to tell everyone they knew that the glorified pamphlet was actually wiser than the combined teachings of Confucious. Freakonomics should spend a whole chapter on that.The only real saving grace I found about the book is that I didn't pay full price for it. Ok, so now you know how I really feel about the book.

Also the idea, that is clearly true, but I'd never thought of it before, that people give their daughters crazier names than their sons.The point of this book is to say that sometimes there are very interesting correlations between things that seem quite disparate. The big one (and I haven't checked, but I assume this one didn't go down terribly well with the religious right in America) was the idea that the drop in violent crime in the US was due to the drop in violent criminals and this was due to there being less people brought up in abject poverty which is due to people being able to have access to abortion and not bringing unwanted children into the world.The comparisons between drug dealers and McDonalds as a corporate structure is now received wisdom - Obama quotes this in his book.Overall this is a great little read and quite fun - but really, I can't think of a single book that was improved by self-congratulation."

Maybe I'm stating it a little strongly, but it has been over two years since I read this book and I'm still angry about one of their premises. The authors proposed that crime rates went down due to the increase in abortions some 15 years earlier. Yes, they claim society is better off without the kids whose parents apparently didn't want them ever having a chance to grow up to be the miscreants they'd be destined to become. That may be a correlation but it is a huge stretch to claim it is a cause and effect. (The decreased crime rate is much better explained by Strauss & Howe in  Generations , by the way.)

If pressed, I'd assign this book to a category I'd call ""Books That People Who Love Malcolm Gladwell Might Also Enjoy."" There's no doubt that Steven D. Levitt is an expert number-cruncher, organizer, and researcher. The conclusions with which he attempts to wow the reader, however, are specious, hyperbolic, and generally lame-o-zoid.*Here's an example: The author explains a situation in which a parent will not permit their young child to go over to a friend's house because the child's friend's parents keep a gun in their home. The [first] parent, however, WILL allow their child to visit a DIFFERENT friend's house whose parents do NOT have a gun, but whose family has a swimming pool. The book then goes on to explain the statistics behind how many children die of gun deaths in this country in a given year versus how many children die in swimming pools in this country each year and determines that the [original] parent is not, according to the data, acting reasonably due to the fact that the likelihood of the child dying in a swimming pool far outweighs the likelihood of the child dying from a gun. Now, there's a reason why, when we talk about gun-safety, we don't talk about swimming pools. It's because swimming pools, if you'd believe it, don't have anything to do with gun safety.** In fact, that entire statistic-set, while an interesting mental exercise, is really no help to the parent. The statistic, were I a parent, that I would be interested in learning is something like: Out of all of the situations involving children dying from gun wounds in this country in a given year, how many of those instances took place when the child was visiting a friend's house? I don't know the answer to that, so, I'll just continue to be pleasantly outraged and move on to my next thought.This book, at its root, is arguing that the things we take for granted, like, belief-wise, might not only not be the case, but the actual truth of the matter(s) might be completely and utterly counter-intuitive to what we feel to be right. I think that's a great message and I wish this was simply a thinking-outside-the-box appreciation book. As a matter of fact, that's exactly what the [nearly two page] epilogue is arguing. With that in mind, I whole-heartedly recommend this book's epilogue. If, however, you're actually looking for a book to explain the hidden, counter-intuitive side to everything, like, for RIZZ, I'd recommend ""Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences"" by John Allen Paulos. BONUS THOUGHT: I should make it clear that I feel that the reason that ""Freakonomics"" is famous and ""Innumeracy"" is not famous, despite the fact that Mr. Paulos uses fewer pages to say more things more clearly, has to do with the fact that there is actual mathematics involved in the latter while the former just requires the reader to want to feel as though they're a smart person. FIN*But, some are for defs totes awes!**I certainly understand the value in thinking abstractly about complicated questions as a way to expand one's mind/cognitive-like-sitch; it's the conclusion that I'm attacking here."
628,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18423957-eleni,2,"For a book that so heavily relies on (mostly) untested assumptions, the repeated, passionate references to the distinction between causality and correlation is impressive if not audacious, to say the least. Suffice to say, 
“""As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions"".
 Exactly, Stephen. And that would work extremely well as an inside joke too. Unless you are implying that, in contrast with the usual textbooks, 
Freakonomics
 actually uses science to pose those questions. In which case, and given the absolute lack of evidence, statistics and insight on any methodological tools here, I can’t help wondering: Science? What science? Where? GIVE ME ONE PAGE. The other unfortunate thing here is the 
“Revised and Expanded edition”
 issue, which can generally mean a number of things, but in the case of 
Freakonomics
 in specific, it was, as we know, the result of a huge wave of negative feedback from reviewers due to:a) the fact that the authors massively exaggerated some of their assumptions (because, obviously: when you think you’re using science when you really are not, that’s just bound to happen) and, as if this isn't enough already, the authors’ reliance on some quite noticeable mathematical monstrosities.b) The self-praise:“Hi. I’m Stephen J. Dubner. And I’m co-authoring this book. The other author is Steven D. Levitt and he’s such a genius, radical economist that we’re thinking we’ll stuff 
Freakonomics
 with tons of newspaper clippings on how awesome he is. And that’s gonna be all over the place. Yes! Oh, in case you’re wondering what a too-cool-for-school unconventional genius like Steven D. Levitt is doing writing books instead of just being a weird recluse in permanent scientific euphoria, worry not! He wasn't interested in writing anything, silly ones (as if)! Not unless it was with me, because, in case you haven’t figured it out already, I’m a kickarse, amazing journalist too! So please read us. Please. We’ll make you feel important and scientific”.So apparently they got the message and scrapped most of that out of the book, hence the 
“Revised and Expanded”
 edition.But honestly, when I found all that out, for a moment I thought I needed to double check that I was actually reading the revised thing.I was? Really? REALLY? WHAT WAS THE FIRST VERSION LIKE THEN?And it’s certainly not my fault that Nick Hornby has the answer to nearly everything. I don’t remember which issue of The Believer he wrote that in, but it was along the lines of: 
""Freakonomics
 was a cool book and it made me feel smart. But what was it about?”Exactly, thank you.Two stars, because some of the questions they pose have interesting political and social implications, even though all questions are always posed through prose (with the use of loose logic at best) and absolutely not through the use of science.Oh.

It's been on my to-read list for a long time, and after finally got around to reading it, I came away disappointed. The book is mostly a disjointed series of unexpected pairings phrased as questions, like ""What do sumo wrestlers and real estate agents have in common?"" Most of the questions would never be anything an average person would ask or wonder about. The book was a haphazard compilation of these pairings and odd questions but, to be fair, the authors explicitly state that from the get-go. I found the sections on parenting and naming babies to be the most interesting, with the rest of it being on the dull side. Many of these questions felt artificially contrived to create a ""freaky"" spin on economics but it felt forced. That was my chief issue with the book - it felt like it was trying to hard to be edgy and hip, like a geeky kid who tries to impress by looking cool and winds up falling flat.I found Dan Arielly's book, Predictably Irrational to be much more entertaining with a smoother flow. Arielly's book deals with behavioral economics and delves into the reasons why people make the choices they do, some of which seem rational but aren't and others which seem irrational but aren't. Arielly's book left me with a greater insight into my own choices and the mechanisms at work behind them. Freakonomics left me with a general thought of ""Hmm, seemingly unrelated stuff is actually related and vice versa."" For anyone interested in behavior economics presented in a very accessible and entertaining manner, I would recommend Arielly's book over Freakonomics, hands down."

Levitt, a ""rogue"" economist by his own admission, and who confesses that he is terrible at traditional economics, uses the methods of statistical analysis to look at the unexplored relations between things in society - like the resemblance between Japanese sumo wrestlers and American schoolteachers, why real-estate agents are similar to the Ku Klux Klan, whether parenting has any effect on how a child turns out... etc, etc. By the confession of the authors themselves, the book has no central theme - it just explores the ""hidden side of everything"". Levitt and Dubner say that economics has the tools to provide the right answers, but only a very few people ask the right questions.Some of his findings do have credibility (like that of schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers cheating to advance their careers, though I did not find anything earthshaking in those); some seem to be refreshing new perspectives (the similarity between the drug mafia and corporate houses, for example); some seem trite to the point of silliness (like the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agents being undone through the availability of information); and some seem to have some substance, but require further study of all parameters (how the station in life and the behaviour of parents affect the children). However, One finding, which is lauded by most reviewers of the book as startling, I found I could take with only a very large lump of salt: that the reduction in crime in the USA in the 1990's is due to the legalisation of abortions in 1973. The authors assume that crime is committed by unwanted children whom their mothers could not get rid of, and once they were allowed to, problem was solved! This, while at the same time arguing gun control is not having much effect either way while increase in police force and punishment is a deterrent, seems to me peddling to the right liberal narrative - at the same time totally ignoring the socioeconomic factors behind crime.As far as I am concerned, any kind of simplistic conclusions drawn from statistical data is suspect. Let me make this clear with an example close to my heart.In India, the state of Kerala in the south (from where I hail) tops in almost all Human Development Indices (HDI) such as health, education etc. However, the state also has the highest morbidity levels. What does this mean? Whether higher levels of general health leads to higher incidence of life-style diseases, or simply that since the healthcare and education are good, more people see doctors? Similarly, Kerala is fourth in India on the basis of reported crime. Does this mean that a higher level of education increases criminal tendencies, or that with a more aware population, more crimes get reported? Heated arguments take place on these questions regularly with no clear conclusions - because there are too many factors to make clear inferences.So does that mean Levitt and Dubner are talking through their hat, and are best ignored? No, in my opinion. This book is worth reading, if only for the unusual perspective. Also, it prompts us to think beyond the glib statistics the ""experts"" spout to intimidate the poor layperson, and see for ourselves."

It's possible to nit-pick at most of the studies, but more importantly the author tends to equate correlation with cause a little too glibly I think. It was a very popular book, but aside from quite a few comments by the major review media about some of the articles, I don't suspect it really had much effect on thinking in the ""social sciences"".

Almost all of this book is filled with unconnected ideas that have no relationship, and he packages these ideas as if they are somehow related and studying them together makes them more real.It's intellectual slight of hand and nothing more. There is no relationship between Sumo wrestling and test scores. Sorry, it just isn't there. The emperor has no clothes.I found his study of abortion and the drop in crime very compelling and very eye-opening. On the other hand, he absolutely dismisses all other possible causes for the drop in crime, which I found arrogant."

647,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9832722-j,1,"About halfway through Freakonomics, and here's the summary thus far:* We are all liars (excepting the authors, apparently).* We are all cheaters (a few of the examples provided: sumo wrestlers; teachers; real estate agents; and pretty much everyone who owns, operates, or works in for-profit business).* We are all bigots (as demonstrated by intensive game show analysis).In fact, most every person is simply horrible. Except for crack dealers. Those guys are just misunderstood by the society that handed them a raw deal from birth.For the uninitiated, this New York Times bestseller (more than three million copies sold) details a lone, prodigious economist's meticulous examinations of some of society's “freaky” questions—debunking conventional wisdom using hard data gathered through deep and unconventional mining, or so the claim goes.Sadly, the book completely ignores its own correlation/causation warning and goes straight for the x-proves-y jugular—not infrequently, but with numerous instances per chapter, if not per page. Here's a simple (and comparatively less offensive) example from today's reading, included in an analysis of online dating:28% of the women on the site said they were blonde, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dying, or lying, or both.The assumptions behind such a statement are noteworthy. Must this conclusion follow from the data? No. The authors assume that those who use online dating sites mirror the population at large. What data do they offer to prove this is the case? None. So, how about some alternative hypotheses:* Older adults are greatly underrepresented on the Internet, compared to other age groups. Even considering those who do get online, how many 70-year-old women are posting profiles on match.com? Eliminating most of the grey-haired, white haired, salt-and-pepper haired, and bald women might alter the percentages, no?* Minority ethnicities are likewise underrepresented online. Many minorities who populate the United States (e.g., blacks, Hispanics, Middle Easterners, Asians) are genetically predisposed to having dark hair. How might this fact alter the odds?* For the sake of argument, let's assume blondness to be a characteristic that increases a woman's comparative physical attractiveness. Might it be reasonable that many such attractive women have become distressed by the type of man who hits on them in, say, a club? It's certainly quite possible that such men, who are likely searching for yet another sexual partner and nothing more, would be keenly interested in physical attractiveness. We could reasonably infer that most of the interactions such women have with men are primarily sexual in nature and, depending on her ultimate aims, much less desirable. How about those attractive women who claim they never get dates, because men are too intimidated to ask them out? What are the prospects of a successful long-term relationship for these women? A dating site sounds like a reasonable alternative to me.* Along those same lines, research has found that attractiveness positively correlates with income (i.e., attractive people tend to make more money). Aren't those with money more likely to (a) own a computer, (b) have the disposable income needed to purchase monthly Internet access and subscriptions to such dating sites, and/or (c) be busy enough with work as to make dating a more complicated enterprise—one demographic explicitly targeted by such web sites?* And my favorite, from a philosophical standpoint: what, precisely, defines blondness? One might say that blondness is defined by the having of blonde hair. By this criteria, does it matter if such hair color is natural or achieved by alternate methods (i.e., dying)? Might it not be that 28% of women actually are blonde, if we throw all those who dye their hair into a group with the natural blondes? After all, is the online dating web site's prompt ""hair color"" or ""natural hair color?""And these are just top-of-the-head scenarios offered by a regular guy with very little research background or statistical training. They all seem like reasonable questions to me—questions that should be explored before making such broad assertions. Does our virtuosic economist take every variable into consideration before drawing his conclusions? Because the book provides no clear reason to believe so, I must assume an answer in the negative.This is one of the simplest and, to my mind, least controversial claims made in the book thus far. The other conclusions drawn are more offensive, particularly when one considers the disturbing lack of evidence provided as support. I'll let you know how things turn out. I'm not expecting a sudden mea culpa."

649,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20426-jen,2,"I feel like Levitt is maybe playing a joke on us. That we, in reading this book and buying into his challenges, are part of an economic experiment illustrating how experts use their position to benefit themselves and themselves only. As prone as I am to envision everything as a conspiracy, I think my support for this one is solid.The economics presented in Freakonomics centers around incentives--human behavior is 100% explained by which of a set of options is most rewarding to that individual. Not an outrageous premise, makes sense. This leads to a discussion on information asymmetry, aka the expert and the mark. Here's where I get skeptical. Citing a mixture of anecdotal and statistical evidence on the behavior of doctors, real estate agents and car mechanics, Levitt argues (without challenge from me) that people with an informational advantage use that advantage strictly in a way that is most beneficial to them. So how then would Levitt justify this book and the ""expert"" position he has assumed? Why should we buy into his scant body of data? Because he get to write a bestselling book, get more air time, speaking engagements, and social clout. He claims to be debunking ""conventional wisdom"" but I think he ends up spinning a whole new yarn.Subjects addressed: crime, abortion, experts, parenting, names, cheating schoolteachers."

I realize that statistics can be made to show anything you want them to, but Levitt spends so much time implying that other people are doing this but he isn't is laughable.I am so glad I got this book from the library and that I didn't buy it, what a waste of money that would have been."

654,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,4,"An engaging read but not necessarily the scintillating, mind-blowing experience it had been hyped as.Levitt and Dubner present their arguments well and their style makes the at-times daunting subject matter easier to approach and thus easier to digest. I don't read much non-fiction (for example) and even less stuff about economics but I found this book quick to get through and I was able to take away their message without having to labor through it.That said, a few points:(1) They make some outrageous claims. To their credit, these claims appear to be backed up by the data. Their rhetoric is frequently hyperbolic though. At times it takes some patience to get the point of a given chapter. The arc tends to go like this: outrageous claim > brief discussion of that claim > discussion of parallel claim > presentation of data > analysis of data > tie them together > see if you can tear down the argument via convention wisdom > oops, conventional wisdom falls under scrutiny of the data. That said, the style makes it easy to break chapters up into small read-it-on-the-can chunks; if you read it that way, prepare to bite your tongue on any given objection until you have finished.(2) In light of #1: Levitt keeps mentioning that he's not much of an economist and even poorer with his math. But there's a lot of math in here. (Presented in a friendly, non-mathematical sort of way, but math nonetheless.) So... Is he just putting us on? Or (as A. would say) is it that ""stats"" aren't ""math""?(3) Also in light of #1: I would like to have seen more of the data. We get a lot of ""xx% decrease"" and ""such-and-such quadrupled"" but the figures themselves are obfuscated. There is an extensive appendix of notes at the end of the book which references specific articles; I'm assuming the ""hard numbers"" are in those articles. But my own background (i.e., bio-psych research papers) biases me to expect a more explicit presentation of those data. So that was disappointing.(4) Levitt & Dubner allege at the beginning of the book that there is no unifying theme. That's more/less crap. The unifying theme seems to be: here are some microeconomics, mostly having to do with crime and/or corruption (see also: crime).(5) The ""Revised & Expanded Edition"" was touted to me as essential because of all the additional articles and re-published blog posts etc. that are now included in this binding. I was a bit under-whelmed by these. They were certainly interesting and they do help illuminate aspects of the text but I didn't necessarily believe that they were essential. (The revisions vis-à-vis Stetson Kennedy's KKK research however: very essential.)"
655,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75637-sean-sullivan,4,"There are at least two ways you can read Freakanomics – as a fun and interesting little book that uses data to tell us little things about ourselves and the world. Or, you can see it as econometrics gone apeshit and finally taking over the world. I kind of view it as both.That said, I really enjoyed reading this. I think Levitt has developed some useful tools that can tell us some interesting stuff about the way little corners of our world are organized. I also think it is a little bit batty to think we can use economic models to prove a causal relationship between abortion laws and crime rates. There might be something there, but in order to come to a conclusion about two subjects so complex, Levitt must have had to control for so many other factors that I doubt his research is all that reliable. In comparison, the section on the economics of the street level drug trade is fascinating and probably close to accurate. The researchers were looking at a relatively small data set, sure, but I think it is still probably tells us at something useful about how that world works.I guess what I find most interesting about this one is the effect it has had on the culture. Economics is so hot right now. Everyone is into it, it is the undergraduate degree on the rise and plenty of those kids decided they liked economics by reading Levitt’s book. I am not sure if this is a good or a bad thing, but it is definitely a trend we can track, at least in part to this book. In the end this is a fast fun and diverting read, but don’t take it too seriously, cause I am pretty sure some of these finding are bunk."

Herewith some of the tidbits I picked up.* About 10% of the population are happy to commit some sort of fraud, even if it just consists of not paying for their lunchtime sandwiches.* IQ is inherited not nurtured* On the whole we don't like old people.* Attractive men are rich, tall and have a full head of hair.* Attractive women are pretty, blonde and not too successful.* The introduction of legalized abortion can drop crime levels.* Money spent on election campaigns is mostly money down the drain.* Often what we say in public is not what we feel in private. (eg racist politicians are often condemned in public but voted for in the privacy of the voting booth.)And the good news...* You can vastly change your life for the better by getting online and doing your own research. Leaving it all to the experts - be they doctors, funeral directors or life insurance agents - is a mugs game.I found this book hugely provocative, but also fascinating, and it has certainly broadened my outlook by a whole stack. I'm not convinced....but it's got me wondering about a lot of stuff. It was also written with humour. Chapter 3 for instance is titled Why Do Drug Dealers Still Live with Their Moms?
