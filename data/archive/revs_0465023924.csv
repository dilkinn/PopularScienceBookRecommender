Addressing key topics in largely qualitative terms without formal mathematics, the six selections discuss atoms in motion, basic physics, the relation of physics to other sciences, conservation of energy, the theory of gravitation, and quantum behavior.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه نوامبر سال 2009 میلادی عنوان: شش قطعهٔ آسان؛ نویسنده: ریچارد فاینمن؛ مترجم محمدرضا بهاری؛ تهران، هرمس، 1387، در نه، 198ص؛ مصور؛ شابک 9789643635558؛ موضوع نوشتارهای علمی از دانشمندان امریکایی - مبانی فیزیک به روایت ریچارد فاینمن - سده 20متصور غلط و رایجی هست که علم مقوله ‌ای است فاقد جنبه‌ های شخصی، بی‌طرف و کاملاً واقع‌نگر اسن؛ فعالیت‌های انسانی‌ِ دیگر، بیشترشان متأثر از روندهای رایج، خواسته ها و اشخاص‌ هستند؛ اما فرض بر آن است که علم محدود به قواعد و روش‌های پذیرفته‌ شده و مقید به آزمون‌های بسیار دقیق‌ است؛ مهم نتایج هستند؛ نه کسانی که آنها را به دست می‌آورندعلم هم همچون همه‌ ی تلاش‌های انسان فعالیتی است انگیخته‌ ی آدمیزاد و به همین مناسبت تابع مد و هوس است؛ در این مورد آنچه مُد را تعیین می‌کند، بیش از آنکه موضوع بحث باشد، جهان‌ بینی دانشمندان است؛ هر دورانی به شیوه‌ ی ویژه ی خود با مسائل علمی رودررو می‌شود، و این رویکرد معمولاً پس از آن برگزیده می‌شود، که شخصیت‌های علمی‌ِ پیشگام، و با نفوذ، دستور کار را تعیین، و بهترین روش‌های رسیدن به نتیجه را شرح کرده‌ اند؛ گاهی دانشمندان آنقدر پرآوازه می‌شوند، که توجه‌ همگی مردمان را هم جلب می‌کنند، و اگر از موهبت استعداد شگرف هم بهره‌ مند باشند، ممکن است نماد تمامی جامعه‌ ی علمی شوند؛ ریچارد فاینمن، همچون نیوتون، و آینشتین، نماد فیزیک آخرین دهه‌ های سده ی بیستم میلادی شدند، و ایشان نخستین آمریکایی‌ ست، که به این جایگاه رسیده اند؛ نقل از متن پشت جلد: ...؛ اما مهم‌ترین کشف در کل نجوم این است که ستاره‌ ها هم از همان نوع اتم‌هایی که در زمین داریم درست شده‌ اند؛ وای که در هر جمله‌ ی این داستان مختصر چقدر مطلب هست...؛ شاعران گفته‌ اند که علم، زیبایی ستاره‌ ها را ضایع می‌کند، چون‌که آن‌ها را صرفاً کُره‌ هایی از اتم‌ها و مولکول‌های گاز می‌داند...؛ امّا من هم می‌توانم ستاره‌ ها را در آسمان شبِ کویر ببینم و شکوه و زیبایی‌شان را حس کنم...؛ شیفته و مبهوت این چرخ فلک، با چشم‌های کوچکم می‌توانم نورهایی به قدمت یک میلیون سال را هم ببینم؛ چه نقش و نگار عظیم و پر ابهتی است اینکه خود من هم جزئی از آنم. آنچه تنم را ساخته، شاید روزگاری شراره‌ ای بوده باشد که از ستاره‌ ی فراموش شده‌ ای بیرون زده است؛ یا می‌توانم این چرخِ فلک را با چشم‌ بزرگ تلسکوپ پالومار تماشا کنم و ببینم که ستاره‌ ها دارند از همدیگر، از نقطه‌ ی آغازی که شاید زمانی سرچشمه‌ ی همه‌گی‌شان بوده‌ است، دور می‌شوند؛ این نقش چگونه است، معنی این حرکت‌ها چیست؟ جست‌وجو برای فهمیدن این چیزها گمان نمی‌کنم لطمه‌ ای به رمز و راز و زیباییِ این چرخ فلک بزند؛ راستی شاعران امروزی چرا حرفی از این چیزها نمی‌زنند؟ چه‌ جور مردمانی هستند این شاعران که اگر ژوپیتر خدایی در هیئتِ انسان باشد چه شعرها که برایش نمی‌سرایند اما اگر در قالبِ کره‌ ی عظیم چرخانی از متان و آمونیاک باشد سکوت می‌کنند؛ پایان نقل از متن پشت جلد کتاب ا. شربیانی"
1,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/639407-tulpesh-patel,4,"There is not much more to be said about Richard Feynman’s impact on physics or science communication; the man is as bona-fide legend and as close to being a worshipable God as scientists can have. Six Easy Pieces is a collection of the ‘easiest’ six chapters from Richard Feynman’s most-celebrated text book The Feynman Lectures on Physics. The ‘easy’ in the title, is, like our sense of time, all relative. The lectures, delivered in the early 60’s, were aimed at “the most intelligent in the class [freshman and sophomore physics students at Caltech, one of the most prestigious institutions in the world] and to make sure, if possible, that even the most intelligent student was unable to encompass everything…” We, as the general reader, are more like the ‘secondary’ audience for the lectures, who for Feyman at the time were the students “for whom the extra fireworks are merely disquieting and who cannot be expected to learn the material in the lecture at all”. Such was Feynman’s power of exposition, however, you can follow the science, each chapter getting progressively more complicated and abstract, without ever feeling like you’re being left behind.The first three chapters, on Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, were so good I read them twice. Their broad remit means they touch on lots of different things, with one astonishing idea thrown in after the other. Mind-body dualism from a physicists perspective: “When an animal learns something, it can do something different than it could before, and its brain cells must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms. In what way is it different?”The final three chapters, on the Conservation of Energy, the Theory of Gravitation and Quantum behaviour are a little heavier, but no less interesting. There’s the occasional formula, which immediately starts the eyes glazing over, but, to the lay reader, they serve to remind you just how much of the book is mathematics translated into wonderful, approachable prose. I’ve read about things like Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle or the “double-slit” experiment, which showed that at the quantum level particles behave both waves and particles, many times before, but is actually the first time that I really *got it*. For that, I cannot recommend the book enough. For those looking for more pop-physics in a similar vein, I can really recommend Why Does E=MC2 by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw, Quantum by Manjit Kumar and Black Holes, Worm Holes and Time Machines by Jim Al-Khalili. Having now read Six Easy Pieces, I can see the obvious influence of Feynman on the not just their content but their delivery and style.There are also three prefaces to the edition of the book I read. Paul Davies’ introduction and David Goldstein’s special preface set the backdrop to the book and the lectures. The most interesting preface is the one written by Feynman himself for the original edition, in which he talks about how he set about piecing the course together, who it was aimed at and why, and how ultimately he felt that he had let his students down in some way. It shows just how much thought he put into the lectures and just how much he cared about educating his students. In some way, as someone enjoys teaching and talking about science, I learnt a lot from these few pages as I did from the rest of the book. Its 50 years since The Feynman Lectures on Physics were published. Our understanding of the universe, and particularly quantum mechanics, has moved on in leaps and bounds but at no point did Six Easy Pieces feel like it was out of date because Feynman’s timeless ways of explaining complicated physics in uncomplicated ways. "
2,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655438-courtney-lindwall,3,"Note to reader: I am not within Feynman's target demographic...So if anyone is familiar with Feynman's ""claim to fame,"" it's basically the idea that he's the most brilliant Physicis teacher of the 20th century and his lectures are ingenius in both their presentation and method. Now, I'm not the most science-inclined person out there. I've never taken even a preliminary physics course (and these lectures were intended for his intro Caltech class, so...). But I'm also not dumb as a rock, either. With that said, I didn't understand much of this book. I could follow along vaguely and in general terms. But could I explain to someone else what gravitational energy is now? Definitely not. In fact, I can barely remember the different topics in the book now because of how little I actually retained about them.For people who think this is going to be a magical book that will teach what were once almost mysteriously complicated ideas with wonderful simplicity - think again. You would never become truly knowledgeable on any of these topics with only this small of an overview. But, if you are scientifically inclined, it might at least be interesting and prompt you to take your learning further. It does get more technical than I thought it would. Although nowhere near as technical as the topics actually go.All in all, I didn't really enjoy it. Which is why it's 3 stars. But I could see its merit for Physics students and it did bring to light various big questions about science in general, which is why it didn't get 2 or 1. "

"
4,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3742957-brent,4,Contains the best explanation for the uncertainty principle I have come across. Still trying to wrap my mind around quantum mechanics though.
5,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14129090-laoonatic,5,"I think that, when reading this book, you have to be familiar with physics and maths. There are a lot of books claiming to be for the neophytes in physics/maths/astrology etc. but, truth be told, there is little to be learned when in that position. Which is why people shouldn't consider this book as being no good just because they haven't reached the paradise of enlightment which was promised to them. Such a thing isn't possible. Not from a single book, as far as I know, and anyway, not from this one. I've been studying both maths and physics for quite some time, but in the manner of a poorly prepared educational system, meaning the focus was more on solving problems and ingesting pages of theory and less on really understanding them. And Feynman's lessons really shed some light on the mess in my head. I can't claim I thoroughly understood everything in this book, but I surely enjoyed Feynman's way of following gradually to smaller scales what happens in an apparently simple process, until he reaches the ""core"" of it.Also, you can't ignore his way of being even poetic at times, which is really why this book won my heart. I have a weakness for science being romanticized. And all ovations go to Richard Feynman for doing this so tactfully."
6,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53036232-rebecca,3,"so this book (if you were at all interested) is a collection of the six 'most basic' lectures delivered by richard feynman when he taught caltech 1st year physics undergrads in the early 1960s. feynman is famously an excellent communicator and very good at explaining physics-y things and coming up with analogies. honestly though, i was a little disappointed.admittedly, i thought the chapter on quantum behaviour (6) was *fantastic*, and probably the best and most thorough explanation i've come across. the maths was a little elusive and unexplained, but that didn't bother me too much as i'm sure i'll learn about it in time & it's not necessary to understand what's going on. but i would definitely recommend this chapter (which you can read online for free - http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.ed...) to anyone to wants to understand quantum behaviour. + i did also enjoy the first two chapters in the book as well, which were on atoms in motion and basic physics.the rest of the book, however, was quite meh. the chapter on the relationship between physics and other sciences (3) was often very vague and seemed to be stating the obvious a lot of the time, although i did find it quite interesting in places (for instance the section on geology and biology, even if the latter seemed to drag on a bit). chapter (4) which was on conservation of energy was pretty confusing sometimes and otherwise pretty unmemorable.so, pretty hit and miss... 2.5 stars? "
7,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11233506-christopher,4,A really lucid introduction to physics—lecture style. 
8,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"In these lectures, Feynman is very good at explaining some basic concepts for those fairly new to physics. For field theory, he uses the analogy of waves in a pool to show how motion in one place affects motion in a distant place. He says that matter goes straight unless acted upon by an external force, but we don't know why; that the earth is pulled toward the sun, as opposed to the earth moving around the sun; and that atoms are always in motion (""jigglings and wigglings of atoms"") and that such movement increases with the application of heat. Feynman stimulates some interesting issues and questions. Under the principle of conservation of energy, the overall amount of energy remains constant; only re-arrangement of energy/atoms occurs. Feynman states that in joining together, atoms ""like certain particular partners, certain particular directions, and so on."" In this way he explains why atom combinations (attraction) take particular forms and resist being something other than such forms. This 'integrity' at the quantum level suggests a 'social' context where atoms interact with each other for particular 'reasons' and that an 'inner character' lies at the heart of quantum physics, as opposed to randomness. Feynman also writes that atoms ""want"" and that ""It is the job of physics to analyze why each one wants what it wants."" ""Want"" is an interesting choice of words. He defines inertia by saying that ""If something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.)"" Does the reference to ""coasting"" mean that a body is passively carried along in space? If so, carried by what, and what is space? Feynman says we don't really know what energy is, but does it involve a 'power' differential where matter and energy move to states of equilibrium? If this is so, then is this one way that gravity (differences in mass and distance) might have a parallel at the quantum level (weight of atoms as they combine or recombine)? Feynman writes that ""all planets push and pull each other."" If ""pull"" is attraction of bodies to each other, it's not clear what push means. For that matter, it's also not clear how ""push and pull"" relate to Einstein's spacetime curvature (oddly, Feynman discusses Einstein's relativity only briefly). Regarding push-pull (attraction-resistance) Feynman makes some suggestive comments when he states that ""the force of electricity between two charged objects looks just like the law of gravitation...."" In describing the earth's movement around the sun, Feynman says that the earth impinges ""on more particles which are coming from its forward side than from its hind side."" Does this mean that the earth ""bunches up space"" (""particles"") as it moves through its orbit and is this related to the earth's gravity? Elsewhere, Feynman states that ""the earth can be understood to be round merely because everything attracts everything else and so it has attracted itself together as far as it can!"" Gravity is not some (mystical) force at the center of the earth, but a pulling of matter and energy inward, against itself, toward the center. While this is all fun stuff to think about, these Feynman lectures do not enlighten much a lay person's understanding of the uncertainty principle, annhilation and antimatter, and absolute time. His last lecture on quantum behavior is particularly difficult. Feynman is at his best discussing the role of doubt and uncertainty in science. When he differs with the theories of the past or of his contemporaries, he seems respectful enough, saying that they are not wrong, but ""a little wrong"" or ""incomplete."" His footnote at the bottom of p. 59 directly challenges those who say wonder and awe are the province of poetry and religion, not science. He also blends life and non-life together when he says that ""'Everything is made of atoms....there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.'"" This is Feynman at his best, and a good challenge for those attempting to put philosophy on a solid materialistic foundation.  "
9,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61033954-m-r,4,"Great book. Feynman is as enigmatic as usual and his descriptions are vivid and inspiring. He begins discussing atoms and shows us how we can understand the world around us using the simple concept of 'jiggling' atoms. I found this to be a profound and exiting way of understanding how things truly work, for example, why does tea cool down when we blow on it? Well, we cause some of the atoms (well molecules in reality) of the tea to get so excited and jiggly that they break away from the liquid and fly off into the air. The more jiggly they are to start with, the more likely they are to break off, thus the tea gets less jiggly and jigglyness is equivalent to heat. Hence the tea gets cooler. The sections on conversational energy, Gravitation and Quantum mechanics are a little basic but interesting nonetheless (after all these are the easy pieces)! "
10,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,I think it is very rare for someone to be not only brilliant but also a wonderful teacher. Feynman has a very clear and direct style of imparting information. I just love it. Not quite as good as his autobiographical one but still very good. 
11,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5413456-gina,3,"Apparently these are the 6 ""easiest to understand"" (despite the inclusion of quantum mechanics!"") of the Feynman lectures. Some of them flit too much from one thing to another; I'm sure they were interesting as lectures but they are not the ideal way to read about a topic. However, the way Feynman explains certain concrete idea is really interesting; in particular the chapter on quantum mechanics is good and easy to follow. I'm on the fence as to whether to read the full set of lectures."
12,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,4,"In the early 1960s the renown physicist, Richard Feynman, delivered introductory courses on physics to first and second year undergraduate students at Caltech, in the USA. His lectures were very popular at the time and whilst aimed at undergraduates, it wasn't uncommon for graduate physics students to infiltrate his classes; the one thing Feynman could be assured of was a full house each time he came to teach this course. The lectures, after some editing, were published in three large volumes. To provide a flavour of the overall series, this book extracts just six from the collection and, as the title of this book suggests, these are regarded as being six of the easier ones to understand. They're entitled ""Atoms in motion"", ""Basic physics, ""The relation of physics to other sciences"", ""Conservation of energy"", ""The theory of gravitation"" and ""Quantum behaviour"". (There is a companion volume published under the title ""Six not-so-easy pieces"" but I've not attempted to read that.) I was attracted to this book not so much by the subject matter, but more by my interest in Feynman himself. He has a solid reputation for being an inspirational teacher and I was keen to see how he managed to achieve this. I was expecting him to take a different strategy from the norm and I wasn't disappointed. To illustrate what I mean, in his lecture on the atom he didn't follow the conventional approach of describing the structure of atoms and building up from there, yet by the end of the talk his students would have heard a physicist's explanation of why blowing on a bowl of soup cools it down. His approach to teaching was so different to what is usually done.Understandably, given the date of the lectures, there have been major developments in physics, and science in general, since the lectures were first presented. For instance, the talk on nuclear physics is very out of date because the make-up of protons and neutrons was not understand at that time to the extent that it is now. Likewise, the lecture covering the links between physics and biology pre-dates the discovery of the genetic code. Therefore, it is pointless reading this book to gain an understanding of the latest theories. Nevertheless, not everything has changed in 50 years and some lectures are as relevant today as they were then. For example, the lecture on the conservation of energy was wonderfully presented, especially the section on potential energy where Feynman used illustrated examples to explain the conservation of potential energy in reversible machines. On the other hand, I felt he made heavy weather of his account of the two slit experiment in his lecture on quantum mechanics and I've read much better explanations elsewhere. To a marked extent Feynman did over complicate much of his material but this is to expected since his stated intention was to teach to slightly beyond the level of the brightest students in each class; of course, whether or not this was the best strategy is open to debate.Overall, this book of six ""easy"" lectures provides remarkable insight into Feynman's style of teaching. He comes across as someone who knew his subject matter inside out, who had boundless energy and complete self-confidence, and who wanted to stretch the minds of his students."
13,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/896694-mark,2,"If you have heard about the ""weirdness"" of quantum mechanics but don't know what the hype is all about, look no further than chapter six of this book. In chapter six, with his usual down-to-earth approach, Feynman describes one of the most famous experiments in physics (the double-slit experiment) and what it tells us about the way fundamental particles behave. He compares the behavior of ""lumps"" to the behavior of ""waves"" before moving on to the behavior of electrons... and the outcome might surprise you (it surprised early 20th-century physicists, too). This is a classic lesson in quantum mechanics taught by one of the classic teachers of physics. And there's no math required.I only gave this book two stars because the other five lectures in this book aren't overly memorable and come nowhere near to being Feynman's greatest lessons. But chapter six alone makes this book worth picking up, especially if you want an introduction to wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, and the conundrum of quantum measurement that is accessible to the layperson but that also demands that you stretch your mind. It's a brief introduction that cuts to the essence of what is going on and, while giving you a decent grounding, will leave you ready to dig deeper and learn more."
14,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104304660-elsie,1,"The thing that bothers me about this is that physics sounds interesting in a book like this but I did my high school physics and first year physics at university and the core of it, the thing you had to learn and understand want the fascinating results and conclusions, it was the collection of vast amounts of data and then the math. The formulas, the statistical analysis, the endless calculation. It's math (maths?). It's all math. And math is beautiful sometimes but it's also a huge amount of grunt learning. I could have recited everything in this book and completely failed every exam in first year university physics if I did. I didn't fail though. Instead I learn how to use the formulas and solve problem questions. That's how you pass. Maybe I'm just bitter but none of this was part of my first year physics 😜"
15,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,5,"4.5/5 starsI picked up this book several months ago and then dropped it despite nearly finishing it due to the complexity of the last chapter: Quantum Behavior. This by no means implies that the book is difficult as a whole.I thoroughly enjoyed the first three chapters: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relations of Physics to Other Sciences. The method he chose to explain the concepts in these chapters was elegant and easy to understand. He compared our understanding the law of physics to watching a game of chess played by the gods (not personal gods) and we humans as observers knowing nothing about the chess rules. However, I have difficulty with understanding quantum mechanics when he started involving mathematic equation, which I particularly have no formal education. I might as well come back to this chapter once I have a better understanding of mathematics.Overall, I would recommend ""Six Easy Pieces"" to anyone who is interested in science, physics especially, to check it out. You might have already known the concepts, but you'll be amazed by his styles."
16,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,4,"Almost five-stars. For someone like me (i.e., a layperson that has no background in physics whatsoever), this is a great introduction to the mysterious world of physics—it is humorous and accessible and makes an effort to be ""approximately accurate"" about everything (while calling itself out on things that are simplified for the sake of the example or else ""unknown or unknowable""). However, to be ""approximately accurate about everything"" means a bunch of math and other fancy-pants equations that look like this:|ĥ₁ + ĥ₂|² = |ĥ₁|² + |ĥ₂|² + 2|ĥ₁||ĥ₂| cos δ...which despite my best efforts remain cloaked in physics' mysterious shroud.""Easy Pieces"", these are not.However, Feynman explains the subject matter well—and certainly better than most other folks that have tried to write this sort of thing.I'm adding him to my short list of heroes."
17,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1664750-connie-kuntz,5,"This book is truly mind-opening and I am convinced that Feynman was one enlightened dude. As I read the book, I felt myself opening up to the concept of atoms, amalgamations, energy, astronomy, gravity, light years, colliders and quantum physics. There was humor, history and simplified experiments in the book, too, which gave the field of Physics an ""inviting"" feeling, rather than a snooty one. The first five chapters were wonderful, but I struggled quite a bit with Chapter 6. To be clear: I still have no grasp on these difficult theories and concepts but now I feel like I have a genuine appreciation for the science and a new way of looking at our world. I learned something that is diffiuclt for me to articulate but I will try: I learned that Physics truly welcomes the connection between past and present, quantum leaps and forward thoughts, the galaxy and a glass of wine, a spiritual presence and Dennis the Menace and much, much more. "
18,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/567005-colleen,3,"Previously, I had read Richard Feynman's ""What Do You Care What They Think"" & absolutely loved it! It goes without saying that Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winner in Physics, is beyond brilliant....but I said it anyway. I enjoy his writing & his joy of discovery in all things scientific. If I'd had a Physics professor like him maybe I would've understood it or had more interest in physical sciences. That said, I found this book very interesting and informative but the formulas & concepts were sometimes a little foreign to me. He was aiming for the brightest of his CalTech first year Physics students & I think I'm missing a little bit of their experience/education in Physics. I found it illuminating; however, I don't think I could explain what I learned without re-reading some sections. I'll probably read some other books by him because I enjoy his ""joie de vivre"". For me, this was 3.5 stars."
19,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"I love this book. I wonder why I didn't study physics when I was younger. It is so fascinating. Physics is probably the most significant science of all time. It has had its impact already on many fronts. There'd be no transistors or cell phones without physics. If we don't apply Einstein's equations into the satellites we build, our GPS will render useless. Physics also has an intimate relationship with other scientific fields like astronomy, chemistry, biology, etc. I think this book is relatively easy to understand even if you have no background in physics. There are times though you may feel a bit out of your depth, especially as we get into the mystifying realm of quantum mechanics. Be that as it may, it is still a good source of knowledge for the physics majors as well as laypeople. You have to read the book with the caveat that it was written back in the 1960's and so a lot were not known back then. For instance, the strong nuclear force was not discovered yet. hope you enjoy."
20,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"I have read several other books by and about Richard Feynman: a man whose brilliance and oddness were well known within the Physics community, but sadly only his eccentricities were known by most of the wider world.This book is not really about Feynman, rather it is six chapters excised out of a two-year course of physics lectures he gave at CalTech in the mid 60s. The publisher created this volume (and a second one that I am just getting into called ""Six Not-So-Easy Pieces"") and a companion audio book in Feynman's own voice about 15 years ago.Although they are not biographical, and I took ""freshman physics"" a while ago, I picked up these two volumes to read how this man attempted to re-invent the teaching of introductory and intermediate physics. The approaches and ""patter"" are definitely Feynman's own. His thinking, humor, and enjoyment of ""natural philosophy"" shine through the pages.Granted the knowledge of cosmology and particle physics contained in this volume are dated (it was 45 years ago, give the guy a break!), but that only adds a patina of warmth to the presentation.The title is correct: there is virtually no math in this volume (except a bit near the end). Nothing that you need to fear: blowing over it will still get you the gist of the point(s).If you have read any of the other books relating Feynman's adventures as a young (20s) man working at Los Alamos, the pick this up and see how the man lived and breathed physics. You'll be happy you did!"
21,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13676431,3,"I liked 4 out of the 6 pieces, so technically it should be 3.3 stars. I didn't like some of them probably because I didn't understand them, and to be fair I didn't focus a lot while reading it, it was more of a leisure read. The gravitational piece was beautiful. It explained big complex ideas with simple analogies that made sense, some of the laws he discussed I knew already but after reading the lecture it all clicked and the picture was more clear. I didn't like the conservation of energy or quantum mechanics, which makes sense for quantum mechanics because, well. However I actually studied the conservation of energy and liked it, I was excited to get a new perspective on it and to get deeper intuition but the analogies did not make any sense and it all was just too confusing. Which is why I think rather than a book it would've been better if I just read lectures on the topics that interest me. I still enjoyed the book and I would probably read Feynman again in the future along with my physics courses. "
22,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216702-steve,3,"That subtitle may seem overwrought, but it's true. Hawking and Greene have done much to popularize (and fetishize) physics, but Feynman will help the layperson really start to understand it at its most conceptual, basic form. And if you haven't the ability to sustain fifteen years of advanced mathematics, these lessons can still illuminate the marvels of the ""mechanism.""To be fair, Hawking (astrophysics) and Greene (quantum mechanics) both do a lot for their respective fields as well, but they aren't Feynman.Oh, by the way, I can't perform the most basic algebraic equations. That is so embarassing."
23,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23258105-dileep-n,4,"This is a sampling from the legendary Feynman Lectures put together to introduce laypeople to physics. I'm not sure this short book succeeds in achieving that goal. It isn't thorough enough or organized well enough to teach people who haven't already been exposed to physics something useful about the subject. If you have dipped your toes in the fascinating world of physics, however, this is definitely worth reading. This book won't teach you anything new but it'll give you new eyes and a new way of looking at some of the central problems of physics. This is where Feynman really shines; he provides some unique and brilliant insights that sometimes change the way you think about a problem and make you go, Aha! The first three chapters explain what physics really is, what doing physics entails, and how physics relates to the other sciences. In the final three chapters, Feynman gets into real physics and discusses conservation of energy, theory of gravitation, and quantum behavior. In the chapter on the theory of gravity, Feynman provides a historic account of its development from Copernicus to Newton and shows us what particular problem each of them was trying to solve and what their contribution was which is really helpful. The other two chapters are also very interesting. There are some simple equations in there but nothing you wouldn't already have seen elsewhere. Feynman frequently surprises you with his refreshing attitude of saying, ""We don't know why that is"", thereby pointing out the limits of existing (during his time) scientific knowledge. I strongly recommend this book to those with a keen interest in physics, not to learn anything new but to get a Feynman-eye-view of basic physics. Also check out its sister volume, The Six Not-So-Easy Pieces."

I could only regret that my primary / high school physics teachers were not able to convey the messages in such a straightforward a compelling manner. The links between cornerstone concepts of physics, chemistry and biology reappeared in a completely different light. The author takes you on an exciting ""understanding tour"" starting with the atomic hypothesis, then placing all basic concepts in both historical and cross-science perspectives to consequently elaborate on the 6 conservations laws (energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, charge, baryons and leptons), gravitational and relativistic discussions to finally serve the quantum behaviour ""explanation"".All packaged in supercilious (100% deservedly!) wrapping of Feynman's unique style.That book should replace (or at least accompany) all first-year school physics lectures!"

When I started reading the first chapter, I was relived. There wasn’t any complex equations, just the central ideas of physics explained in a way that I could understand. Even though the title of Feynman’s book is Six Easy Pieces, it wasn’t easy in a dumbed down sort of way. This book made me think, or maybe I should say it allowed me to think, since the way Feynman explained physics gave me the information I needed to begin to understand how the laws of physics influence our world."

31,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/639407-tulpesh-patel,4,"There is not much more to be said about Richard Feynman’s impact on physics or science communication; the man is as bona-fide legend and as close to being a worshipable God as scientists can have. Six Easy Pieces is a collection of the ‘easiest’ six chapters from Richard Feynman’s most-celebrated text book The Feynman Lectures on Physics. The ‘easy’ in the title, is, like our sense of time, all relative. The lectures, delivered in the early 60’s, were aimed at “the most intelligent in the class [freshman and sophomore physics students at Caltech, one of the most prestigious institutions in the world] and to make sure, if possible, that even the most intelligent student was unable to encompass everything…” We, as the general reader, are more like the ‘secondary’ audience for the lectures, who for Feyman at the time were the students “for whom the extra fireworks are merely disquieting and who cannot be expected to learn the material in the lecture at all”. Such was Feynman’s power of exposition, however, you can follow the science, each chapter getting progressively more complicated and abstract, without ever feeling like you’re being left behind.The first three chapters, on Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, were so good I read them twice. Their broad remit means they touch on lots of different things, with one astonishing idea thrown in after the other. Mind-body dualism from a physicists perspective: “When an animal learns something, it can do something different than it could before, and its brain cells must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms. In what way is it different?”The final three chapters, on the Conservation of Energy, the Theory of Gravitation and Quantum behaviour are a little heavier, but no less interesting. There’s the occasional formula, which immediately starts the eyes glazing over, but, to the lay reader, they serve to remind you just how much of the book is mathematics translated into wonderful, approachable prose. I’ve read about things like Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle or the “double-slit” experiment, which showed that at the quantum level particles behave both waves and particles, many times before, but is actually the first time that I really *got it*. For that, I cannot recommend the book enough. For those looking for more pop-physics in a similar vein, I can really recommend Why Does E=MC2 by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw, Quantum by Manjit Kumar and Black Holes, Worm Holes and Time Machines by Jim Al-Khalili. Having now read Six Easy Pieces, I can see the obvious influence of Feynman on the not just their content but their delivery and style.There are also three prefaces to the edition of the book I read. Paul Davies’ introduction and David Goldstein’s special preface set the backdrop to the book and the lectures. The most interesting preface is the one written by Feynman himself for the original edition, in which he talks about how he set about piecing the course together, who it was aimed at and why, and how ultimately he felt that he had let his students down in some way. It shows just how much thought he put into the lectures and just how much he cared about educating his students. In some way, as someone enjoys teaching and talking about science, I learnt a lot from these few pages as I did from the rest of the book. Its 50 years since The Feynman Lectures on Physics were published. Our understanding of the universe, and particularly quantum mechanics, has moved on in leaps and bounds but at no point did Six Easy Pieces feel like it was out of date because Feynman’s timeless ways of explaining complicated physics in uncomplicated ways.

32,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655438-courtney-lindwall,3,"Note to reader: I am not within Feynman's target demographic...So if anyone is familiar with Feynman's ""claim to fame,"" it's basically the idea that he's the most brilliant Physicis teacher of the 20th century and his lectures are ingenius in both their presentation and method. Now, I'm not the most science-inclined person out there. I've never taken even a preliminary physics course (and these lectures were intended for his intro Caltech class, so...). But I'm also not dumb as a rock, either. With that said, I didn't understand much of this book. I could follow along vaguely and in general terms. But could I explain to someone else what gravitational energy is now? Definitely not. In fact, I can barely remember the different topics in the book now because of how little I actually retained about them.For people who think this is going to be a magical book that will teach what were once almost mysteriously complicated ideas with wonderful simplicity - think again. You would never become truly knowledgeable on any of these topics with only this small of an overview. But, if you are scientifically inclined, it might at least be interesting and prompt you to take your learning further. It does get more technical than I thought it would. Although nowhere near as technical as the topics actually go.All in all, I didn't really enjoy it. Which is why it's 3 stars. But I could see its merit for Physics students and it did bring to light various big questions about science in general, which is why it didn't get 2 or 1. "

35,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14129090-laoonatic,5,"I think that, when reading this book, you have to be familiar with physics and maths. There are a lot of books claiming to be for the neophytes in physics/maths/astrology etc. but, truth be told, there is little to be learned when in that position. Which is why people shouldn't consider this book as being no good just because they haven't reached the paradise of enlightment which was promised to them. Such a thing isn't possible. Not from a single book, as far as I know, and anyway, not from this one. I've been studying both maths and physics for quite some time, but in the manner of a poorly prepared educational system, meaning the focus was more on solving problems and ingesting pages of theory and less on really understanding them. And Feynman's lessons really shed some light on the mess in my head. I can't claim I thoroughly understood everything in this book, but I surely enjoyed Feynman's way of following gradually to smaller scales what happens in an apparently simple process, until he reaches the ""core"" of it.Also, you can't ignore his way of being even poetic at times, which is really why this book won my heart. I have a weakness for science being romanticized. And all ovations go to Richard Feynman for doing this so tactfully."
36,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53036232-rebecca,3,"so this book (if you were at all interested) is a collection of the six 'most basic' lectures delivered by richard feynman when he taught caltech 1st year physics undergrads in the early 1960s. feynman is famously an excellent communicator and very good at explaining physics-y things and coming up with analogies. honestly though, i was a little disappointed.admittedly, i thought the chapter on quantum behaviour (6) was *fantastic*, and probably the best and most thorough explanation i've come across. the maths was a little elusive and unexplained, but that didn't bother me too much as i'm sure i'll learn about it in time & it's not necessary to understand what's going on. but i would definitely recommend this chapter (which you can read online for free - http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.ed...) to anyone to wants to understand quantum behaviour. + i did also enjoy the first two chapters in the book as well, which were on atoms in motion and basic physics.the rest of the book, however, was quite meh. the chapter on the relationship between physics and other sciences (3) was often very vague and seemed to be stating the obvious a lot of the time, although i did find it quite interesting in places (for instance the section on geology and biology, even if the latter seemed to drag on a bit). chapter (4) which was on conservation of energy was pretty confusing sometimes and otherwise pretty unmemorable.so, pretty hit and miss... 2.5 stars? "
37,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11233506-christopher,4,A really lucid introduction to physics—lecture style. 
38,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"In these lectures, Feynman is very good at explaining some basic concepts for those fairly new to physics. For field theory, he uses the analogy of waves in a pool to show how motion in one place affects motion in a distant place. He says that matter goes straight unless acted upon by an external force, but we don't know why; that the earth is pulled toward the sun, as opposed to the earth moving around the sun; and that atoms are always in motion (""jigglings and wigglings of atoms"") and that such movement increases with the application of heat. Feynman stimulates some interesting issues and questions. Under the principle of conservation of energy, the overall amount of energy remains constant; only re-arrangement of energy/atoms occurs. Feynman states that in joining together, atoms ""like certain particular partners, certain particular directions, and so on."" In this way he explains why atom combinations (attraction) take particular forms and resist being something other than such forms. This 'integrity' at the quantum level suggests a 'social' context where atoms interact with each other for particular 'reasons' and that an 'inner character' lies at the heart of quantum physics, as opposed to randomness. Feynman also writes that atoms ""want"" and that ""It is the job of physics to analyze why each one wants what it wants."" ""Want"" is an interesting choice of words. He defines inertia by saying that ""If something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.)"" Does the reference to ""coasting"" mean that a body is passively carried along in space? If so, carried by what, and what is space? Feynman says we don't really know what energy is, but does it involve a 'power' differential where matter and energy move to states of equilibrium? If this is so, then is this one way that gravity (differences in mass and distance) might have a parallel at the quantum level (weight of atoms as they combine or recombine)? Feynman writes that ""all planets push and pull each other."" If ""pull"" is attraction of bodies to each other, it's not clear what push means. For that matter, it's also not clear how ""push and pull"" relate to Einstein's spacetime curvature (oddly, Feynman discusses Einstein's relativity only briefly). Regarding push-pull (attraction-resistance) Feynman makes some suggestive comments when he states that ""the force of electricity between two charged objects looks just like the law of gravitation...."" In describing the earth's movement around the sun, Feynman says that the earth impinges ""on more particles which are coming from its forward side than from its hind side."" Does this mean that the earth ""bunches up space"" (""particles"") as it moves through its orbit and is this related to the earth's gravity? Elsewhere, Feynman states that ""the earth can be understood to be round merely because everything attracts everything else and so it has attracted itself together as far as it can!"" Gravity is not some (mystical) force at the center of the earth, but a pulling of matter and energy inward, against itself, toward the center. While this is all fun stuff to think about, these Feynman lectures do not enlighten much a lay person's understanding of the uncertainty principle, annhilation and antimatter, and absolute time. His last lecture on quantum behavior is particularly difficult. Feynman is at his best discussing the role of doubt and uncertainty in science. When he differs with the theories of the past or of his contemporaries, he seems respectful enough, saying that they are not wrong, but ""a little wrong"" or ""incomplete."" His footnote at the bottom of p. 59 directly challenges those who say wonder and awe are the province of poetry and religion, not science. He also blends life and non-life together when he says that ""'Everything is made of atoms....there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.'"" This is Feynman at his best, and a good challenge for those attempting to put philosophy on a solid materialistic foundation.  "
39,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61033954-m-r,4,"Great book. Feynman is as enigmatic as usual and his descriptions are vivid and inspiring. He begins discussing atoms and shows us how we can understand the world around us using the simple concept of 'jiggling' atoms. I found this to be a profound and exiting way of understanding how things truly work, for example, why does tea cool down when we blow on it? Well, we cause some of the atoms (well molecules in reality) of the tea to get so excited and jiggly that they break away from the liquid and fly off into the air. The more jiggly they are to start with, the more likely they are to break off, thus the tea gets less jiggly and jigglyness is equivalent to heat. Hence the tea gets cooler. The sections on conversational energy, Gravitation and Quantum mechanics are a little basic but interesting nonetheless (after all these are the easy pieces)! "
40,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,I think it is very rare for someone to be not only brilliant but also a wonderful teacher. Feynman has a very clear and direct style of imparting information. I just love it. Not quite as good as his autobiographical one but still very good. 
41,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5413456-gina,3,"Apparently these are the 6 ""easiest to understand"" (despite the inclusion of quantum mechanics!"") of the Feynman lectures. Some of them flit too much from one thing to another; I'm sure they were interesting as lectures but they are not the ideal way to read about a topic. However, the way Feynman explains certain concrete idea is really interesting; in particular the chapter on quantum mechanics is good and easy to follow. I'm on the fence as to whether to read the full set of lectures."
42,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,4,"In the early 1960s the renown physicist, Richard Feynman, delivered introductory courses on physics to first and second year undergraduate students at Caltech, in the USA. His lectures were very popular at the time and whilst aimed at undergraduates, it wasn't uncommon for graduate physics students to infiltrate his classes; the one thing Feynman could be assured of was a full house each time he came to teach this course. The lectures, after some editing, were published in three large volumes. To provide a flavour of the overall series, this book extracts just six from the collection and, as the title of this book suggests, these are regarded as being six of the easier ones to understand. They're entitled ""Atoms in motion"", ""Basic physics, ""The relation of physics to other sciences"", ""Conservation of energy"", ""The theory of gravitation"" and ""Quantum behaviour"". (There is a companion volume published under the title ""Six not-so-easy pieces"" but I've not attempted to read that.) I was attracted to this book not so much by the subject matter, but more by my interest in Feynman himself. He has a solid reputation for being an inspirational teacher and I was keen to see how he managed to achieve this. I was expecting him to take a different strategy from the norm and I wasn't disappointed. To illustrate what I mean, in his lecture on the atom he didn't follow the conventional approach of describing the structure of atoms and building up from there, yet by the end of the talk his students would have heard a physicist's explanation of why blowing on a bowl of soup cools it down. His approach to teaching was so different to what is usually done.Understandably, given the date of the lectures, there have been major developments in physics, and science in general, since the lectures were first presented. For instance, the talk on nuclear physics is very out of date because the make-up of protons and neutrons was not understand at that time to the extent that it is now. Likewise, the lecture covering the links between physics and biology pre-dates the discovery of the genetic code. Therefore, it is pointless reading this book to gain an understanding of the latest theories. Nevertheless, not everything has changed in 50 years and some lectures are as relevant today as they were then. For example, the lecture on the conservation of energy was wonderfully presented, especially the section on potential energy where Feynman used illustrated examples to explain the conservation of potential energy in reversible machines. On the other hand, I felt he made heavy weather of his account of the two slit experiment in his lecture on quantum mechanics and I've read much better explanations elsewhere. To a marked extent Feynman did over complicate much of his material but this is to expected since his stated intention was to teach to slightly beyond the level of the brightest students in each class; of course, whether or not this was the best strategy is open to debate.Overall, this book of six ""easy"" lectures provides remarkable insight into Feynman's style of teaching. He comes across as someone who knew his subject matter inside out, who had boundless energy and complete self-confidence, and who wanted to stretch the minds of his students."
43,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/896694-mark,2,"If you have heard about the ""weirdness"" of quantum mechanics but don't know what the hype is all about, look no further than chapter six of this book. In chapter six, with his usual down-to-earth approach, Feynman describes one of the most famous experiments in physics (the double-slit experiment) and what it tells us about the way fundamental particles behave. He compares the behavior of ""lumps"" to the behavior of ""waves"" before moving on to the behavior of electrons... and the outcome might surprise you (it surprised early 20th-century physicists, too). This is a classic lesson in quantum mechanics taught by one of the classic teachers of physics. And there's no math required.I only gave this book two stars because the other five lectures in this book aren't overly memorable and come nowhere near to being Feynman's greatest lessons. But chapter six alone makes this book worth picking up, especially if you want an introduction to wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, and the conundrum of quantum measurement that is accessible to the layperson but that also demands that you stretch your mind. It's a brief introduction that cuts to the essence of what is going on and, while giving you a decent grounding, will leave you ready to dig deeper and learn more."
44,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104304660-elsie,1,"The thing that bothers me about this is that physics sounds interesting in a book like this but I did my high school physics and first year physics at university and the core of it, the thing you had to learn and understand want the fascinating results and conclusions, it was the collection of vast amounts of data and then the math. The formulas, the statistical analysis, the endless calculation. It's math (maths?). It's all math. And math is beautiful sometimes but it's also a huge amount of grunt learning. I could have recited everything in this book and completely failed every exam in first year university physics if I did. I didn't fail though. Instead I learn how to use the formulas and solve problem questions. That's how you pass. Maybe I'm just bitter but none of this was part of my first year physics 😜"

This by no means implies that the book is difficult as a whole.I thoroughly enjoyed the first three chapters: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relations of Physics to Other Sciences. The method he chose to explain the concepts in these chapters was elegant and easy to understand. He compared our understanding the law of physics to watching a game of chess played by the gods (not personal gods) and we humans as observers knowing nothing about the chess rules. However, I have difficulty with understanding quantum mechanics when he started involving mathematic equation, which I particularly have no formal education. I might as well come back to this chapter once I have a better understanding of mathematics.Overall, I would recommend ""Six Easy Pieces"" to anyone who is interested in science, physics especially, to check it out. You might have already known the concepts, but you'll be amazed by his styles."

For someone like me (i.e., a layperson that has no background in physics whatsoever), this is a great introduction to the mysterious world of physics—it is humorous and accessible and makes an effort to be ""approximately accurate"" about everything (while calling itself out on things that are simplified for the sake of the example or else ""unknown or unknowable""). However, to be ""approximately accurate about everything"" means a bunch of math and other fancy-pants equations that look like this:|ĥ₁ + ĥ₂|² = |ĥ₁|² + |ĥ₂|² + 2|ĥ₁||ĥ₂| cos δ...which despite my best efforts remain cloaked in physics' mysterious shroud.""Easy Pieces"", these are not.However, Feynman explains the subject matter well—and certainly better than most other folks that have tried to write this sort of thing.I'm adding him to my short list of heroes."

As I read the book, I felt myself opening up to the concept of atoms, amalgamations, energy, astronomy, gravity, light years, colliders and quantum physics. There was humor, history and simplified experiments in the book, too, which gave the field of Physics an ""inviting"" feeling, rather than a snooty one. The first five chapters were wonderful, but I struggled quite a bit with Chapter 6. To be clear: I still have no grasp on these difficult theories and concepts but now I feel like I have a genuine appreciation for the science and a new way of looking at our world. I learned something that is diffiuclt for me to articulate but I will try: I learned that Physics truly welcomes the connection between past and present, quantum leaps and forward thoughts, the galaxy and a glass of wine, a spiritual presence and Dennis the Menace and much, much more.

It goes without saying that Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winner in Physics, is beyond brilliant....but I said it anyway. I enjoy his writing & his joy of discovery in all things scientific. If I'd had a Physics professor like him maybe I would've understood it or had more interest in physical sciences. That said, I found this book very interesting and informative but the formulas & concepts were sometimes a little foreign to me. He was aiming for the brightest of his CalTech first year Physics students & I think I'm missing a little bit of their experience/education in Physics. I found it illuminating; however, I don't think I could explain what I learned without re-reading some sections. I'll probably read some other books by him because I enjoy his ""joie de vivre"". For me, this was 3.5 stars."
49,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"I love this book. I wonder why I didn't study physics when I was younger. It is so fascinating. Physics is probably the most significant science of all time. It has had its impact already on many fronts. There'd be no transistors or cell phones without physics. If we don't apply Einstein's equations into the satellites we build, our GPS will render useless. Physics also has an intimate relationship with other scientific fields like astronomy, chemistry, biology, etc. I think this book is relatively easy to understand even if you have no background in physics. There are times though you may feel a bit out of your depth, especially as we get into the mystifying realm of quantum mechanics. Be that as it may, it is still a good source of knowledge for the physics majors as well as laypeople. You have to read the book with the caveat that it was written back in the 1960's and so a lot were not known back then. For instance, the strong nuclear force was not discovered yet. hope you enjoy."
50,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"I have read several other books by and about Richard Feynman: a man whose brilliance and oddness were well known within the Physics community, but sadly only his eccentricities were known by most of the wider world.This book is not really about Feynman, rather it is six chapters excised out of a two-year course of physics lectures he gave at CalTech in the mid 60s. The publisher created this volume (and a second one that I am just getting into called ""Six Not-So-Easy Pieces"") and a companion audio book in Feynman's own voice about 15 years ago.Although they are not biographical, and I took ""freshman physics"" a while ago, I picked up these two volumes to read how this man attempted to re-invent the teaching of introductory and intermediate physics. The approaches and ""patter"" are definitely Feynman's own. His thinking, humor, and enjoyment of ""natural philosophy"" shine through the pages.Granted the knowledge of cosmology and particle physics contained in this volume are dated (it was 45 years ago, give the guy a break!), but that only adds a patina of warmth to the presentation.The title is correct: there is virtually no math in this volume (except a bit near the end). Nothing that you need to fear: blowing over it will still get you the gist of the point(s).If you have read any of the other books relating Feynman's adventures as a young (20s) man working at Los Alamos, the pick this up and see how the man lived and breathed physics. You'll be happy you did!"
51,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13676431,3,"I liked 4 out of the 6 pieces, so technically it should be 3.3 stars. I didn't like some of them probably because I didn't understand them, and to be fair I didn't focus a lot while reading it, it was more of a leisure read. The gravitational piece was beautiful. It explained big complex ideas with simple analogies that made sense, some of the laws he discussed I knew already but after reading the lecture it all clicked and the picture was more clear. I didn't like the conservation of energy or quantum mechanics, which makes sense for quantum mechanics because, well. However I actually studied the conservation of energy and liked it, I was excited to get a new perspective on it and to get deeper intuition but the analogies did not make any sense and it all was just too confusing. Which is why I think rather than a book it would've been better if I just read lectures on the topics that interest me. I still enjoyed the book and I would probably read Feynman again in the future along with my physics courses. "

Hawking and Greene have done much to popularize (and fetishize) physics, but Feynman will help the layperson really start to understand it at its most conceptual, basic form. And if you haven't the ability to sustain fifteen years of advanced mathematics, these lessons can still illuminate the marvels of the ""mechanism.""To be fair, Hawking (astrophysics) and Greene (quantum mechanics) both do a lot for their respective fields as well, but they aren't Feynman.Oh, by the way, I can't perform the most basic algebraic equations. That is so embarassing."

I'm not sure this short book succeeds in achieving that goal. It isn't thorough enough or organized well enough to teach people who haven't already been exposed to physics something useful about the subject. If you have dipped your toes in the fascinating world of physics, however, this is definitely worth reading. This book won't teach you anything new but it'll give you new eyes and a new way of looking at some of the central problems of physics. This is where Feynman really shines; he provides some unique and brilliant insights that sometimes change the way you think about a problem and make you go, Aha! The first three chapters explain what physics really is, what doing physics entails, and how physics relates to the other sciences. In the final three chapters, Feynman gets into real physics and discusses conservation of energy, theory of gravitation, and quantum behavior. In the chapter on the theory of gravity, Feynman provides a historic account of its development from Copernicus to Newton and shows us what particular problem each of them was trying to solve and what their contribution was which is really helpful. The other two chapters are also very interesting. There are some simple equations in there but nothing you wouldn't already have seen elsewhere. Feynman frequently surprises you with his refreshing attitude of saying, ""We don't know why that is"", thereby pointing out the limits of existing (during his time) scientific knowledge. I strongly recommend this book to those with a keen interest in physics, not to learn anything new but to get a Feynman-eye-view of basic physics.

Even though the title of Feynman’s book is Six Easy Pieces, it wasn’t easy in a dumbed down sort of way.

61,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/639407-tulpesh-patel,4,"There is not much more to be said about Richard Feynman’s impact on physics or science communication; the man is as bona-fide legend and as close to being a worshipable God as scientists can have. Six Easy Pieces is a collection of the ‘easiest’ six chapters from Richard Feynman’s most-celebrated text book The Feynman Lectures on Physics. The ‘easy’ in the title, is, like our sense of time, all relative. The lectures, delivered in the early 60’s, were aimed at “the most intelligent in the class [freshman and sophomore physics students at Caltech, one of the most prestigious institutions in the world] and to make sure, if possible, that even the most intelligent student was unable to encompass everything…” We, as the general reader, are more like the ‘secondary’ audience for the lectures, who for Feyman at the time were the students “for whom the extra fireworks are merely disquieting and who cannot be expected to learn the material in the lecture at all”. Such was Feynman’s power of exposition, however, you can follow the science, each chapter getting progressively more complicated and abstract, without ever feeling like you’re being left behind.The first three chapters, on Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, were so good I read them twice. Their broad remit means they touch on lots of different things, with one astonishing idea thrown in after the other. Mind-body dualism from a physicists perspective: “When an animal learns something, it can do something different than it could before, and its brain cells must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms. In what way is it different?”The final three chapters, on the Conservation of Energy, the Theory of Gravitation and Quantum behaviour are a little heavier, but no less interesting. There’s the occasional formula, which immediately starts the eyes glazing over, but, to the lay reader, they serve to remind you just how much of the book is mathematics translated into wonderful, approachable prose. I’ve read about things like Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle or the “double-slit” experiment, which showed that at the quantum level particles behave both waves and particles, many times before, but is actually the first time that I really *got it*. For that, I cannot recommend the book enough. For those looking for more pop-physics in a similar vein, I can really recommend Why Does E=MC2 by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw, Quantum by Manjit Kumar and Black Holes, Worm Holes and Time Machines by Jim Al-Khalili. Having now read Six Easy Pieces, I can see the obvious influence of Feynman on the not just their content but their delivery and style.There are also three prefaces to the edition of the book I read. Paul Davies’ introduction and David Goldstein’s special preface set the backdrop to the book and the lectures. The most interesting preface is the one written by Feynman himself for the original edition, in which he talks about how he set about piecing the course together, who it was aimed at and why, and how ultimately he felt that he had let his students down in some way. It shows just how much thought he put into the lectures and just how much he cared about educating his students. In some way, as someone enjoys teaching and talking about science, I learnt a lot from these few pages as I did from the rest of the book. Its 50 years since The Feynman Lectures on Physics were published. Our understanding of the universe, and particularly quantum mechanics, has moved on in leaps and bounds but at no point did Six Easy Pieces feel like it was out of date because Feynman’s timeless ways of explaining complicated physics in uncomplicated ways.

62,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655438-courtney-lindwall,3,"Note to reader: I am not within Feynman's target demographic...So if anyone is familiar with Feynman's ""claim to fame,"" it's basically the idea that he's the most brilliant Physicis teacher of the 20th century and his lectures are ingenius in both their presentation and method. Now, I'm not the most science-inclined person out there. I've never taken even a preliminary physics course (and these lectures were intended for his intro Caltech class, so...). But I'm also not dumb as a rock, either. With that said, I didn't understand much of this book. I could follow along vaguely and in general terms. But could I explain to someone else what gravitational energy is now? Definitely not. In fact, I can barely remember the different topics in the book now because of how little I actually retained about them.For people who think this is going to be a magical book that will teach what were once almost mysteriously complicated ideas with wonderful simplicity - think again. You would never become truly knowledgeable on any of these topics with only this small of an overview. But, if you are scientifically inclined, it might at least be interesting and prompt you to take your learning further. It does get more technical than I thought it would. Although nowhere near as technical as the topics actually go.All in all, I didn't really enjoy it. Which is why it's 3 stars. But I could see its merit for Physics students and it did bring to light various big questions about science in general, which is why it didn't get 2 or 1. "

65,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14129090-laoonatic,5,"I think that, when reading this book, you have to be familiar with physics and maths. There are a lot of books claiming to be for the neophytes in physics/maths/astrology etc. but, truth be told, there is little to be learned when in that position. Which is why people shouldn't consider this book as being no good just because they haven't reached the paradise of enlightment which was promised to them. Such a thing isn't possible. Not from a single book, as far as I know, and anyway, not from this one. I've been studying both maths and physics for quite some time, but in the manner of a poorly prepared educational system, meaning the focus was more on solving problems and ingesting pages of theory and less on really understanding them. And Feynman's lessons really shed some light on the mess in my head. I can't claim I thoroughly understood everything in this book, but I surely enjoyed Feynman's way of following gradually to smaller scales what happens in an apparently simple process, until he reaches the ""core"" of it.Also, you can't ignore his way of being even poetic at times, which is really why this book won my heart. I have a weakness for science being romanticized. And all ovations go to Richard Feynman for doing this so tactfully."

"
67,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11233506-christopher,4,A really lucid introduction to physics—lecture style. 
68,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"In these lectures, Feynman is very good at explaining some basic concepts for those fairly new to physics. For field theory, he uses the analogy of waves in a pool to show how motion in one place affects motion in a distant place. He says that matter goes straight unless acted upon by an external force, but we don't know why; that the earth is pulled toward the sun, as opposed to the earth moving around the sun; and that atoms are always in motion (""jigglings and wigglings of atoms"") and that such movement increases with the application of heat. Feynman stimulates some interesting issues and questions. Under the principle of conservation of energy, the overall amount of energy remains constant; only re-arrangement of energy/atoms occurs. Feynman states that in joining together, atoms ""like certain particular partners, certain particular directions, and so on."" In this way he explains why atom combinations (attraction) take particular forms and resist being something other than such forms. This 'integrity' at the quantum level suggests a 'social' context where atoms interact with each other for particular 'reasons' and that an 'inner character' lies at the heart of quantum physics, as opposed to randomness. Feynman also writes that atoms ""want"" and that ""It is the job of physics to analyze why each one wants what it wants."" ""Want"" is an interesting choice of words. He defines inertia by saying that ""If something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.)"" Does the reference to ""coasting"" mean that a body is passively carried along in space? If so, carried by what, and what is space? Feynman says we don't really know what energy is, but does it involve a 'power' differential where matter and energy move to states of equilibrium? If this is so, then is this one way that gravity (differences in mass and distance) might have a parallel at the quantum level (weight of atoms as they combine or recombine)? Feynman writes that ""all planets push and pull each other."" If ""pull"" is attraction of bodies to each other, it's not clear what push means. For that matter, it's also not clear how ""push and pull"" relate to Einstein's spacetime curvature (oddly, Feynman discusses Einstein's relativity only briefly). Regarding push-pull (attraction-resistance) Feynman makes some suggestive comments when he states that ""the force of electricity between two charged objects looks just like the law of gravitation...."" In describing the earth's movement around the sun, Feynman says that the earth impinges ""on more particles which are coming from its forward side than from its hind side."" Does this mean that the earth ""bunches up space"" (""particles"") as it moves through its orbit and is this related to the earth's gravity? Elsewhere, Feynman states that ""the earth can be understood to be round merely because everything attracts everything else and so it has attracted itself together as far as it can!"" Gravity is not some (mystical) force at the center of the earth, but a pulling of matter and energy inward, against itself, toward the center. While this is all fun stuff to think about, these Feynman lectures do not enlighten much a lay person's understanding of the uncertainty principle, annhilation and antimatter, and absolute time. His last lecture on quantum behavior is particularly difficult. Feynman is at his best discussing the role of doubt and uncertainty in science. When he differs with the theories of the past or of his contemporaries, he seems respectful enough, saying that they are not wrong, but ""a little wrong"" or ""incomplete."" His footnote at the bottom of p. 59 directly challenges those who say wonder and awe are the province of poetry and religion, not science. He also blends life and non-life together when he says that ""'Everything is made of atoms....there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.'"" This is Feynman at his best, and a good challenge for those attempting to put philosophy on a solid materialistic foundation.  "
69,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61033954-m-r,4,"Great book. Feynman is as enigmatic as usual and his descriptions are vivid and inspiring. He begins discussing atoms and shows us how we can understand the world around us using the simple concept of 'jiggling' atoms. I found this to be a profound and exiting way of understanding how things truly work, for example, why does tea cool down when we blow on it? Well, we cause some of the atoms (well molecules in reality) of the tea to get so excited and jiggly that they break away from the liquid and fly off into the air. The more jiggly they are to start with, the more likely they are to break off, thus the tea gets less jiggly and jigglyness is equivalent to heat. Hence the tea gets cooler. The sections on conversational energy, Gravitation and Quantum mechanics are a little basic but interesting nonetheless (after all these are the easy pieces)! "
70,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,I think it is very rare for someone to be not only brilliant but also a wonderful teacher. Feynman has a very clear and direct style of imparting information. I just love it. Not quite as good as his autobiographical one but still very good. 
71,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5413456-gina,3,"Apparently these are the 6 ""easiest to understand"" (despite the inclusion of quantum mechanics!"") of the Feynman lectures. Some of them flit too much from one thing to another; I'm sure they were interesting as lectures but they are not the ideal way to read about a topic. However, the way Feynman explains certain concrete idea is really interesting; in particular the chapter on quantum mechanics is good and easy to follow. I'm on the fence as to whether to read the full set of lectures."
72,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,4,"In the early 1960s the renown physicist, Richard Feynman, delivered introductory courses on physics to first and second year undergraduate students at Caltech, in the USA. His lectures were very popular at the time and whilst aimed at undergraduates, it wasn't uncommon for graduate physics students to infiltrate his classes; the one thing Feynman could be assured of was a full house each time he came to teach this course. The lectures, after some editing, were published in three large volumes. To provide a flavour of the overall series, this book extracts just six from the collection and, as the title of this book suggests, these are regarded as being six of the easier ones to understand. They're entitled ""Atoms in motion"", ""Basic physics, ""The relation of physics to other sciences"", ""Conservation of energy"", ""The theory of gravitation"" and ""Quantum behaviour"". (There is a companion volume published under the title ""Six not-so-easy pieces"" but I've not attempted to read that.) I was attracted to this book not so much by the subject matter, but more by my interest in Feynman himself. He has a solid reputation for being an inspirational teacher and I was keen to see how he managed to achieve this. I was expecting him to take a different strategy from the norm and I wasn't disappointed. To illustrate what I mean, in his lecture on the atom he didn't follow the conventional approach of describing the structure of atoms and building up from there, yet by the end of the talk his students would have heard a physicist's explanation of why blowing on a bowl of soup cools it down. His approach to teaching was so different to what is usually done.Understandably, given the date of the lectures, there have been major developments in physics, and science in general, since the lectures were first presented. For instance, the talk on nuclear physics is very out of date because the make-up of protons and neutrons was not understand at that time to the extent that it is now. Likewise, the lecture covering the links between physics and biology pre-dates the discovery of the genetic code. Therefore, it is pointless reading this book to gain an understanding of the latest theories. Nevertheless, not everything has changed in 50 years and some lectures are as relevant today as they were then. For example, the lecture on the conservation of energy was wonderfully presented, especially the section on potential energy where Feynman used illustrated examples to explain the conservation of potential energy in reversible machines. On the other hand, I felt he made heavy weather of his account of the two slit experiment in his lecture on quantum mechanics and I've read much better explanations elsewhere. To a marked extent Feynman did over complicate much of his material but this is to expected since his stated intention was to teach to slightly beyond the level of the brightest students in each class; of course, whether or not this was the best strategy is open to debate.Overall, this book of six ""easy"" lectures provides remarkable insight into Feynman's style of teaching. He comes across as someone who knew his subject matter inside out, who had boundless energy and complete self-confidence, and who wanted to stretch the minds of his students."
73,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/896694-mark,2,"If you have heard about the ""weirdness"" of quantum mechanics but don't know what the hype is all about, look no further than chapter six of this book. In chapter six, with his usual down-to-earth approach, Feynman describes one of the most famous experiments in physics (the double-slit experiment) and what it tells us about the way fundamental particles behave. He compares the behavior of ""lumps"" to the behavior of ""waves"" before moving on to the behavior of electrons... and the outcome might surprise you (it surprised early 20th-century physicists, too). This is a classic lesson in quantum mechanics taught by one of the classic teachers of physics. And there's no math required.I only gave this book two stars because the other five lectures in this book aren't overly memorable and come nowhere near to being Feynman's greatest lessons. But chapter six alone makes this book worth picking up, especially if you want an introduction to wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, and the conundrum of quantum measurement that is accessible to the layperson but that also demands that you stretch your mind. It's a brief introduction that cuts to the essence of what is going on and, while giving you a decent grounding, will leave you ready to dig deeper and learn more."

The formulas, the statistical analysis, the endless calculation. It's math (maths?). It's all math. And math is beautiful sometimes but it's also a huge amount of grunt learning. I could have recited everything in this book and completely failed every exam in first year university physics if I did. I didn't fail though. Instead I learn how to use the formulas and solve problem questions. That's how you pass. Maybe I'm just bitter but none of this was part of my first year physics 😜"

This by no means implies that the book is difficult as a whole.I thoroughly enjoyed the first three chapters: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relations of Physics to Other Sciences. The method he chose to explain the concepts in these chapters was elegant and easy to understand. He compared our understanding the law of physics to watching a game of chess played by the gods (not personal gods) and we humans as observers knowing nothing about the chess rules. However, I have difficulty with understanding quantum mechanics when he started involving mathematic equation, which I particularly have no formal education. I might as well come back to this chapter once I have a better understanding of mathematics.Overall, I would recommend ""Six Easy Pieces"" to anyone who is interested in science, physics especially, to check it out. You might have already known the concepts, but you'll be amazed by his styles."
76,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,4,"Almost five-stars. For someone like me (i.e., a layperson that has no background in physics whatsoever), this is a great introduction to the mysterious world of physics—it is humorous and accessible and makes an effort to be ""approximately accurate"" about everything (while calling itself out on things that are simplified for the sake of the example or else ""unknown or unknowable""). However, to be ""approximately accurate about everything"" means a bunch of math and other fancy-pants equations that look like this:|ĥ₁ + ĥ₂|² = |ĥ₁|² + |ĥ₂|² + 2|ĥ₁||ĥ₂| cos δ...which despite my best efforts remain cloaked in physics' mysterious shroud.""Easy Pieces"", these are not.However, Feynman explains the subject matter well—and certainly better than most other folks that have tried to write this sort of thing.I'm adding him to my short list of heroes."
77,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1664750-connie-kuntz,5,"This book is truly mind-opening and I am convinced that Feynman was one enlightened dude. As I read the book, I felt myself opening up to the concept of atoms, amalgamations, energy, astronomy, gravity, light years, colliders and quantum physics. There was humor, history and simplified experiments in the book, too, which gave the field of Physics an ""inviting"" feeling, rather than a snooty one. The first five chapters were wonderful, but I struggled quite a bit with Chapter 6. To be clear: I still have no grasp on these difficult theories and concepts but now I feel like I have a genuine appreciation for the science and a new way of looking at our world. I learned something that is diffiuclt for me to articulate but I will try: I learned that Physics truly welcomes the connection between past and present, quantum leaps and forward thoughts, the galaxy and a glass of wine, a spiritual presence and Dennis the Menace and much, much more.

It goes without saying that Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winner in Physics, is beyond brilliant....but I said it anyway. I enjoy his writing & his joy of discovery in all things scientific. If I'd had a Physics professor like him maybe I would've understood it or had more interest in physical sciences. That said, I found this book very interesting and informative but the formulas & concepts were sometimes a little foreign to me. He was aiming for the brightest of his CalTech first year Physics students & I think I'm missing a little bit of their experience/education in Physics. I found it illuminating; however, I don't think I could explain what I learned without re-reading some sections. I'll probably read some other books by him because I enjoy his ""joie de vivre"".

Physics is probably the most significant science of all time. It has had its impact already on many fronts. There'd be no transistors or cell phones without physics. If we don't apply Einstein's equations into the satellites we build, our GPS will render useless. Physics also has an intimate relationship with other scientific fields like astronomy, chemistry, biology, etc. I think this book is relatively easy to understand even if you have no background in physics. There are times though you may feel a bit out of your depth, especially as we get into the mystifying realm of quantum mechanics. Be that as it may, it is still a good source of knowledge for the physics majors as well as laypeople. You have to read the book with the caveat that it was written back in the 1960's and so a lot were not known back then. For instance, the strong nuclear force was not discovered yet. hope you enjoy."
80,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"I have read several other books by and about Richard Feynman: a man whose brilliance and oddness were well known within the Physics community, but sadly only his eccentricities were known by most of the wider world.This book is not really about Feynman, rather it is six chapters excised out of a two-year course of physics lectures he gave at CalTech in the mid 60s. The publisher created this volume (and a second one that I am just getting into called ""Six Not-So-Easy Pieces"") and a companion audio book in Feynman's own voice about 15 years ago.Although they are not biographical, and I took ""freshman physics"" a while ago, I picked up these two volumes to read how this man attempted to re-invent the teaching of introductory and intermediate physics. The approaches and ""patter"" are definitely Feynman's own. His thinking, humor, and enjoyment of ""natural philosophy"" shine through the pages.Granted the knowledge of cosmology and particle physics contained in this volume are dated (it was 45 years ago, give the guy a break!), but that only adds a patina of warmth to the presentation.The title is correct: there is virtually no math in this volume (except a bit near the end). Nothing that you need to fear: blowing over it will still get you the gist of the point(s).If you have read any of the other books relating Feynman's adventures as a young (20s) man working at Los Alamos, the pick this up and see how the man lived and breathed physics.

I didn't like some of them probably because I didn't understand them, and to be fair I didn't focus a lot while reading it, it was more of a leisure read. The gravitational piece was beautiful. It explained big complex ideas with simple analogies that made sense, some of the laws he discussed I knew already but after reading the lecture it all clicked and the picture was more clear. I didn't like the conservation of energy or quantum mechanics, which makes sense for quantum mechanics because, well. However I actually studied the conservation of energy and liked it, I was excited to get a new perspective on it and to get deeper intuition but the analogies did not make any sense and it all was just too confusing. Which is why I think rather than a book it would've been better if I just read lectures on the topics that interest me. I still enjoyed the book and I would probably read Feynman again in the future along with my physics courses. "

Hawking and Greene have done much to popularize (and fetishize) physics, but Feynman will help the layperson really start to understand it at its most conceptual, basic form. And if you haven't the ability to sustain fifteen years of advanced mathematics, these lessons can still illuminate the marvels of the ""mechanism.""To be fair, Hawking (astrophysics) and Greene (quantum mechanics) both do a lot for their respective fields as well, but they aren't Feynman.Oh, by the way, I can't perform the most basic algebraic equations. That is so embarassing."

I'm not sure this short book succeeds in achieving that goal. It isn't thorough enough or organized well enough to teach people who haven't already been exposed to physics something useful about the subject. If you have dipped your toes in the fascinating world of physics, however, this is definitely worth reading. This book won't teach you anything new but it'll give you new eyes and a new way of looking at some of the central problems of physics. This is where Feynman really shines; he provides some unique and brilliant insights that sometimes change the way you think about a problem and make you go, Aha! The first three chapters explain what physics really is, what doing physics entails, and how physics relates to the other sciences. In the final three chapters, Feynman gets into real physics and discusses conservation of energy, theory of gravitation, and quantum behavior. In the chapter on the theory of gravity, Feynman provides a historic account of its development from Copernicus to Newton and shows us what particular problem each of them was trying to solve and what their contribution was which is really helpful. The other two chapters are also very interesting. There are some simple equations in there but nothing you wouldn't already have seen elsewhere. Feynman frequently surprises you with his refreshing attitude of saying, ""We don't know why that is"", thereby pointing out the limits of existing (during his time) scientific knowledge. I strongly recommend this book to those with a keen interest in physics, not to learn anything new but to get a Feynman-eye-view of basic physics.

The links between cornerstone concepts of physics, chemistry and biology reappeared in a completely different light. The author takes you on an exciting ""understanding tour"" starting with the atomic hypothesis, then placing all basic concepts in both historical and cross-science perspectives to consequently elaborate on the 6 conservations laws (energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, charge, baryons and leptons), gravitational and relativistic discussions to finally serve the quantum behaviour ""explanation"".All packaged in supercilious (100% deservedly!) wrapping of Feynman's unique style.That book should replace (or at least accompany) all first-year school physics lectures!"

Even though the title of Feynman’s book is Six Easy Pieces, it wasn’t easy in a dumbed down sort of way.

Six Easy Pieces is a collection of the ‘easiest’ six chapters from Richard Feynman’s most-celebrated text book The Feynman Lectures on Physics. The ‘easy’ in the title, is, like our sense of time, all relative. The lectures, delivered in the early 60’s, were aimed at “the most intelligent in the class [freshman and sophomore physics students at Caltech, one of the most prestigious institutions in the world] and to make sure, if possible, that even the most intelligent student was unable to encompass everything…” We, as the general reader, are more like the ‘secondary’ audience for the lectures, who for Feyman at the time were the students “for whom the extra fireworks are merely disquieting and who cannot be expected to learn the material in the lecture at all”. Such was Feynman’s power of exposition, however, you can follow the science, each chapter getting progressively more complicated and abstract, without ever feeling like you’re being left behind.The first three chapters, on Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, were so good I read them twice. Their broad remit means they touch on lots of different things, with one astonishing idea thrown in after the other. Mind-body dualism from a physicists perspective: “When an animal learns something, it can do something different than it could before, and its brain cells must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms. In what way is it different?”The final three chapters, on the Conservation of Energy, the Theory of Gravitation and Quantum behaviour are a little heavier, but no less interesting. There’s the occasional formula, which immediately starts the eyes glazing over, but, to the lay reader, they serve to remind you just how much of the book is mathematics translated into wonderful, approachable prose. I’ve read about things like Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle or the “double-slit” experiment, which showed that at the quantum level particles behave both waves and particles, many times before, but is actually the first time that I really *got it*. For that, I cannot recommend the book enough. For those looking for more pop-physics in a similar vein, I can really recommend Why Does E=MC2 by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw, Quantum by Manjit Kumar and Black Holes, Worm Holes and Time Machines by Jim Al-Khalili. Having now read Six Easy Pieces, I can see the obvious influence of Feynman on the not just their content but their delivery and style.There are also three prefaces to the edition of the book I read. Paul Davies’ introduction and David Goldstein’s special preface set the backdrop to the book and the lectures. The most interesting preface is the one written by Feynman himself for the original edition, in which he talks about how he set about piecing the course together, who it was aimed at and why, and how ultimately he felt that he had let his students down in some way. It shows just how much thought he put into the lectures and just how much he cared about educating his students. In some way, as someone enjoys teaching and talking about science, I learnt a lot from these few pages as I did from the rest of the book. Its 50 years since The Feynman Lectures on Physics were published. Our understanding of the universe, and particularly quantum mechanics, has moved on in leaps and bounds but at no point did Six Easy Pieces feel like it was out of date because Feynman’s timeless ways of explaining complicated physics in uncomplicated ways.

92,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655438-courtney-lindwall,3,"Note to reader: I am not within Feynman's target demographic...So if anyone is familiar with Feynman's ""claim to fame,"" it's basically the idea that he's the most brilliant Physicis teacher of the 20th century and his lectures are ingenius in both their presentation and method. Now, I'm not the most science-inclined person out there. I've never taken even a preliminary physics course (and these lectures were intended for his intro Caltech class, so...). But I'm also not dumb as a rock, either. With that said, I didn't understand much of this book. I could follow along vaguely and in general terms. But could I explain to someone else what gravitational energy is now? Definitely not. In fact, I can barely remember the different topics in the book now because of how little I actually retained about them.For people who think this is going to be a magical book that will teach what were once almost mysteriously complicated ideas with wonderful simplicity - think again. You would never become truly knowledgeable on any of these topics with only this small of an overview. But, if you are scientifically inclined, it might at least be interesting and prompt you to take your learning further. It does get more technical than I thought it would. Although nowhere near as technical as the topics actually go.All in all, I didn't really enjoy it. Which is why it's 3 stars. But I could see its merit for Physics students and it did bring to light various big questions about science in general, which is why it didn't get 2 or 1. "

There are a lot of books claiming to be for the neophytes in physics/maths/astrology etc. but, truth be told, there is little to be learned when in that position. Which is why people shouldn't consider this book as being no good just because they haven't reached the paradise of enlightment which was promised to them. Such a thing isn't possible. Not from a single book, as far as I know, and anyway, not from this one. I've been studying both maths and physics for quite some time, but in the manner of a poorly prepared educational system, meaning the focus was more on solving problems and ingesting pages of theory and less on really understanding them. And Feynman's lessons really shed some light on the mess in my head. I can't claim I thoroughly understood everything in this book, but I surely enjoyed Feynman's way of following gradually to smaller scales what happens in an apparently simple process, until he reaches the ""core"" of it.Also, you can't ignore his way of being even poetic at times, which is really why this book won my heart. I have a weakness for science being romanticized. And all ovations go to Richard Feynman for doing this so tactfully."

97,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11233506-christopher,4,A really lucid introduction to physics—lecture style. 
98,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"In these lectures, Feynman is very good at explaining some basic concepts for those fairly new to physics. For field theory, he uses the analogy of waves in a pool to show how motion in one place affects motion in a distant place. He says that matter goes straight unless acted upon by an external force, but we don't know why; that the earth is pulled toward the sun, as opposed to the earth moving around the sun; and that atoms are always in motion (""jigglings and wigglings of atoms"") and that such movement increases with the application of heat. Feynman stimulates some interesting issues and questions. Under the principle of conservation of energy, the overall amount of energy remains constant; only re-arrangement of energy/atoms occurs. Feynman states that in joining together, atoms ""like certain particular partners, certain particular directions, and so on."" In this way he explains why atom combinations (attraction) take particular forms and resist being something other than such forms. This 'integrity' at the quantum level suggests a 'social' context where atoms interact with each other for particular 'reasons' and that an 'inner character' lies at the heart of quantum physics, as opposed to randomness. Feynman also writes that atoms ""want"" and that ""It is the job of physics to analyze why each one wants what it wants."" ""Want"" is an interesting choice of words. He defines inertia by saying that ""If something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.)"" Does the reference to ""coasting"" mean that a body is passively carried along in space? If so, carried by what, and what is space? Feynman says we don't really know what energy is, but does it involve a 'power' differential where matter and energy move to states of equilibrium? If this is so, then is this one way that gravity (differences in mass and distance) might have a parallel at the quantum level (weight of atoms as they combine or recombine)? Feynman writes that ""all planets push and pull each other."" If ""pull"" is attraction of bodies to each other, it's not clear what push means. For that matter, it's also not clear how ""push and pull"" relate to Einstein's spacetime curvature (oddly, Feynman discusses Einstein's relativity only briefly). Regarding push-pull (attraction-resistance) Feynman makes some suggestive comments when he states that ""the force of electricity between two charged objects looks just like the law of gravitation...."" In describing the earth's movement around the sun, Feynman says that the earth impinges ""on more particles which are coming from its forward side than from its hind side."" Does this mean that the earth ""bunches up space"" (""particles"") as it moves through its orbit and is this related to the earth's gravity? Elsewhere, Feynman states that ""the earth can be understood to be round merely because everything attracts everything else and so it has attracted itself together as far as it can!"" Gravity is not some (mystical) force at the center of the earth, but a pulling of matter and energy inward, against itself, toward the center. While this is all fun stuff to think about, these Feynman lectures do not enlighten much a lay person's understanding of the uncertainty principle, annhilation and antimatter, and absolute time. His last lecture on quantum behavior is particularly difficult. Feynman is at his best discussing the role of doubt and uncertainty in science. When he differs with the theories of the past or of his contemporaries, he seems respectful enough, saying that they are not wrong, but ""a little wrong"" or ""incomplete."" His footnote at the bottom of p. 59 directly challenges those who say wonder and awe are the province of poetry and religion, not science. He also blends life and non-life together when he says that ""'Everything is made of atoms....there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.'"" This is Feynman at his best, and a good challenge for those attempting to put philosophy on a solid materialistic foundation.  "
99,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61033954-m-r,4,"Great book. Feynman is as enigmatic as usual and his descriptions are vivid and inspiring. He begins discussing atoms and shows us how we can understand the world around us using the simple concept of 'jiggling' atoms. I found this to be a profound and exiting way of understanding how things truly work, for example, why does tea cool down when we blow on it? Well, we cause some of the atoms (well molecules in reality) of the tea to get so excited and jiggly that they break away from the liquid and fly off into the air. The more jiggly they are to start with, the more likely they are to break off, thus the tea gets less jiggly and jigglyness is equivalent to heat. Hence the tea gets cooler. The sections on conversational energy, Gravitation and Quantum mechanics are a little basic but interesting nonetheless (after all these are the easy pieces)! "
100,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,I think it is very rare for someone to be not only brilliant but also a wonderful teacher. Feynman has a very clear and direct style of imparting information. I just love it. Not quite as good as his autobiographical one but still very good. 
101,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5413456-gina,3,"Apparently these are the 6 ""easiest to understand"" (despite the inclusion of quantum mechanics!"") of the Feynman lectures. Some of them flit too much from one thing to another; I'm sure they were interesting as lectures but they are not the ideal way to read about a topic. However, the way Feynman explains certain concrete idea is really interesting; in particular the chapter on quantum mechanics is good and easy to follow. I'm on the fence as to whether to read the full set of lectures."
102,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,4,"In the early 1960s the renown physicist, Richard Feynman, delivered introductory courses on physics to first and second year undergraduate students at Caltech, in the USA. His lectures were very popular at the time and whilst aimed at undergraduates, it wasn't uncommon for graduate physics students to infiltrate his classes; the one thing Feynman could be assured of was a full house each time he came to teach this course. The lectures, after some editing, were published in three large volumes. To provide a flavour of the overall series, this book extracts just six from the collection and, as the title of this book suggests, these are regarded as being six of the easier ones to understand. They're entitled ""Atoms in motion"", ""Basic physics, ""The relation of physics to other sciences"", ""Conservation of energy"", ""The theory of gravitation"" and ""Quantum behaviour"". (There is a companion volume published under the title ""Six not-so-easy pieces"" but I've not attempted to read that.) I was attracted to this book not so much by the subject matter, but more by my interest in Feynman himself. He has a solid reputation for being an inspirational teacher and I was keen to see how he managed to achieve this. I was expecting him to take a different strategy from the norm and I wasn't disappointed. To illustrate what I mean, in his lecture on the atom he didn't follow the conventional approach of describing the structure of atoms and building up from there, yet by the end of the talk his students would have heard a physicist's explanation of why blowing on a bowl of soup cools it down. His approach to teaching was so different to what is usually done.Understandably, given the date of the lectures, there have been major developments in physics, and science in general, since the lectures were first presented. For instance, the talk on nuclear physics is very out of date because the make-up of protons and neutrons was not understand at that time to the extent that it is now. Likewise, the lecture covering the links between physics and biology pre-dates the discovery of the genetic code. Therefore, it is pointless reading this book to gain an understanding of the latest theories. Nevertheless, not everything has changed in 50 years and some lectures are as relevant today as they were then. For example, the lecture on the conservation of energy was wonderfully presented, especially the section on potential energy where Feynman used illustrated examples to explain the conservation of potential energy in reversible machines. On the other hand, I felt he made heavy weather of his account of the two slit experiment in his lecture on quantum mechanics and I've read much better explanations elsewhere. To a marked extent Feynman did over complicate much of his material but this is to expected since his stated intention was to teach to slightly beyond the level of the brightest students in each class; of course, whether or not this was the best strategy is open to debate.Overall, this book of six ""easy"" lectures provides remarkable insight into Feynman's style of teaching. He comes across as someone who knew his subject matter inside out, who had boundless energy and complete self-confidence, and who wanted to stretch the minds of his students."
103,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/896694-mark,2,"If you have heard about the ""weirdness"" of quantum mechanics but don't know what the hype is all about, look no further than chapter six of this book. In chapter six, with his usual down-to-earth approach, Feynman describes one of the most famous experiments in physics (the double-slit experiment) and what it tells us about the way fundamental particles behave. He compares the behavior of ""lumps"" to the behavior of ""waves"" before moving on to the behavior of electrons... and the outcome might surprise you (it surprised early 20th-century physicists, too). This is a classic lesson in quantum mechanics taught by one of the classic teachers of physics. And there's no math required.I only gave this book two stars because the other five lectures in this book aren't overly memorable and come nowhere near to being Feynman's greatest lessons. But chapter six alone makes this book worth picking up, especially if you want an introduction to wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, and the conundrum of quantum measurement that is accessible to the layperson but that also demands that you stretch your mind. It's a brief introduction that cuts to the essence of what is going on and, while giving you a decent grounding, will leave you ready to dig deeper and learn more."
104,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104304660-elsie,1,"The thing that bothers me about this is that physics sounds interesting in a book like this but I did my high school physics and first year physics at university and the core of it, the thing you had to learn and understand want the fascinating results and conclusions, it was the collection of vast amounts of data and then the math. The formulas, the statistical analysis, the endless calculation. It's math (maths?). It's all math. And math is beautiful sometimes but it's also a huge amount of grunt learning. I could have recited everything in this book and completely failed every exam in first year university physics if I did. I didn't fail though. Instead I learn how to use the formulas and solve problem questions. That's how you pass. Maybe I'm just bitter but none of this was part of my first year physics 😜"
105,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,5,"4.5/5 starsI picked up this book several months ago and then dropped it despite nearly finishing it due to the complexity of the last chapter: Quantum Behavior. This by no means implies that the book is difficult as a whole.I thoroughly enjoyed the first three chapters: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relations of Physics to Other Sciences. The method he chose to explain the concepts in these chapters was elegant and easy to understand. He compared our understanding the law of physics to watching a game of chess played by the gods (not personal gods) and we humans as observers knowing nothing about the chess rules. However, I have difficulty with understanding quantum mechanics when he started involving mathematic equation, which I particularly have no formal education. I might as well come back to this chapter once I have a better understanding of mathematics.Overall, I would recommend ""Six Easy Pieces"" to anyone who is interested in science, physics especially, to check it out. You might have already known the concepts, but you'll be amazed by his styles."
106,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,4,"Almost five-stars. For someone like me (i.e., a layperson that has no background in physics whatsoever), this is a great introduction to the mysterious world of physics—it is humorous and accessible and makes an effort to be ""approximately accurate"" about everything (while calling itself out on things that are simplified for the sake of the example or else ""unknown or unknowable""). However, to be ""approximately accurate about everything"" means a bunch of math and other fancy-pants equations that look like this:|ĥ₁ + ĥ₂|² = |ĥ₁|² + |ĥ₂|² + 2|ĥ₁||ĥ₂| cos δ...which despite my best efforts remain cloaked in physics' mysterious shroud.""Easy Pieces"", these are not.However, Feynman explains the subject matter well—and certainly better than most other folks that have tried to write this sort of thing.I'm adding him to my short list of heroes."
107,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1664750-connie-kuntz,5,"This book is truly mind-opening and I am convinced that Feynman was one enlightened dude. As I read the book, I felt myself opening up to the concept of atoms, amalgamations, energy, astronomy, gravity, light years, colliders and quantum physics. There was humor, history and simplified experiments in the book, too, which gave the field of Physics an ""inviting"" feeling, rather than a snooty one. The first five chapters were wonderful, but I struggled quite a bit with Chapter 6. To be clear: I still have no grasp on these difficult theories and concepts but now I feel like I have a genuine appreciation for the science and a new way of looking at our world. I learned something that is diffiuclt for me to articulate but I will try: I learned that Physics truly welcomes the connection between past and present, quantum leaps and forward thoughts, the galaxy and a glass of wine, a spiritual presence and Dennis the Menace and much, much more.

It goes without saying that Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winner in Physics, is beyond brilliant....but I said it anyway. I enjoy his writing & his joy of discovery in all things scientific. If I'd had a Physics professor like him maybe I would've understood it or had more interest in physical sciences. That said, I found this book very interesting and informative but the formulas & concepts were sometimes a little foreign to me. He was aiming for the brightest of his CalTech first year Physics students & I think I'm missing a little bit of their experience/education in Physics. I found it illuminating; however, I don't think I could explain what I learned without re-reading some sections. I'll probably read some other books by him because I enjoy his ""joie de vivre"". For me, this was 3.5 stars."
109,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"I love this book. I wonder why I didn't study physics when I was younger. It is so fascinating. Physics is probably the most significant science of all time. It has had its impact already on many fronts. There'd be no transistors or cell phones without physics. If we don't apply Einstein's equations into the satellites we build, our GPS will render useless. Physics also has an intimate relationship with other scientific fields like astronomy, chemistry, biology, etc. I think this book is relatively easy to understand even if you have no background in physics. There are times though you may feel a bit out of your depth, especially as we get into the mystifying realm of quantum mechanics. Be that as it may, it is still a good source of knowledge for the physics majors as well as laypeople. You have to read the book with the caveat that it was written back in the 1960's and so a lot were not known back then. For instance, the strong nuclear force was not discovered yet. hope you enjoy."
110,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"I have read several other books by and about Richard Feynman: a man whose brilliance and oddness were well known within the Physics community, but sadly only his eccentricities were known by most of the wider world.This book is not really about Feynman, rather it is six chapters excised out of a two-year course of physics lectures he gave at CalTech in the mid 60s. The publisher created this volume (and a second one that I am just getting into called ""Six Not-So-Easy Pieces"") and a companion audio book in Feynman's own voice about 15 years ago.Although they are not biographical, and I took ""freshman physics"" a while ago, I picked up these two volumes to read how this man attempted to re-invent the teaching of introductory and intermediate physics. The approaches and ""patter"" are definitely Feynman's own. His thinking, humor, and enjoyment of ""natural philosophy"" shine through the pages.Granted the knowledge of cosmology and particle physics contained in this volume are dated (it was 45 years ago, give the guy a break!), but that only adds a patina of warmth to the presentation.The title is correct: there is virtually no math in this volume (except a bit near the end). Nothing that you need to fear: blowing over it will still get you the gist of the point(s).If you have read any of the other books relating Feynman's adventures as a young (20s) man working at Los Alamos, the pick this up and see how the man lived and breathed physics. You'll be happy you did!"
111,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13676431,3,"I liked 4 out of the 6 pieces, so technically it should be 3.3 stars. I didn't like some of them probably because I didn't understand them, and to be fair I didn't focus a lot while reading it, it was more of a leisure read. The gravitational piece was beautiful. It explained big complex ideas with simple analogies that made sense, some of the laws he discussed I knew already but after reading the lecture it all clicked and the picture was more clear. I didn't like the conservation of energy or quantum mechanics, which makes sense for quantum mechanics because, well. However I actually studied the conservation of energy and liked it, I was excited to get a new perspective on it and to get deeper intuition but the analogies did not make any sense and it all was just too confusing. Which is why I think rather than a book it would've been better if I just read lectures on the topics that interest me. I still enjoyed the book and I would probably read Feynman again in the future along with my physics courses. "
112,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216702-steve,3,"That subtitle may seem overwrought, but it's true. Hawking and Greene have done much to popularize (and fetishize) physics, but Feynman will help the layperson really start to understand it at its most conceptual, basic form. And if you haven't the ability to sustain fifteen years of advanced mathematics, these lessons can still illuminate the marvels of the ""mechanism.""To be fair, Hawking (astrophysics) and Greene (quantum mechanics) both do a lot for their respective fields as well, but they aren't Feynman.Oh, by the way, I can't perform the most basic algebraic equations. That is so embarassing."

I'm not sure this short book succeeds in achieving that goal. It isn't thorough enough or organized well enough to teach people who haven't already been exposed to physics something useful about the subject. If you have dipped your toes in the fascinating world of physics, however, this is definitely worth reading. This book won't teach you anything new but it'll give you new eyes and a new way of looking at some of the central problems of physics. This is where Feynman really shines; he provides some unique and brilliant insights that sometimes change the way you think about a problem and make you go, Aha! The first three chapters explain what physics really is, what doing physics entails, and how physics relates to the other sciences. In the final three chapters, Feynman gets into real physics and discusses conservation of energy, theory of gravitation, and quantum behavior. In the chapter on the theory of gravity, Feynman provides a historic account of its development from Copernicus to Newton and shows us what particular problem each of them was trying to solve and what their contribution was which is really helpful. The other two chapters are also very interesting. There are some simple equations in there but nothing you wouldn't already have seen elsewhere. Feynman frequently surprises you with his refreshing attitude of saying, ""We don't know why that is"", thereby pointing out the limits of existing (during his time) scientific knowledge. I strongly recommend this book to those with a keen interest in physics, not to learn anything new but to get a Feynman-eye-view of basic physics. Also check out its sister volume, The Six Not-So-Easy Pieces."

I could only regret that my primary / high school physics teachers were not able to convey the messages in such a straightforward a compelling manner. The links between cornerstone concepts of physics, chemistry and biology reappeared in a completely different light. The author takes you on an exciting ""understanding tour"" starting with the atomic hypothesis, then placing all basic concepts in both historical and cross-science perspectives to consequently elaborate on the 6 conservations laws (energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, charge, baryons and leptons), gravitational and relativistic discussions to finally serve the quantum behaviour ""explanation"".All packaged in supercilious (100% deservedly!) wrapping of Feynman's unique style.That book should replace (or at least accompany) all first-year school physics lectures!"

Even though the title of Feynman’s book is Six Easy Pieces, it wasn’t easy in a dumbed down sort of way.

Six Easy Pieces is a collection of the ‘easiest’ six chapters from Richard Feynman’s most-celebrated text book The Feynman Lectures on Physics. The ‘easy’ in the title, is, like our sense of time, all relative. The lectures, delivered in the early 60’s, were aimed at “the most intelligent in the class [freshman and sophomore physics students at Caltech, one of the most prestigious institutions in the world] and to make sure, if possible, that even the most intelligent student was unable to encompass everything…” We, as the general reader, are more like the ‘secondary’ audience for the lectures, who for Feyman at the time were the students “for whom the extra fireworks are merely disquieting and who cannot be expected to learn the material in the lecture at all”. Such was Feynman’s power of exposition, however, you can follow the science, each chapter getting progressively more complicated and abstract, without ever feeling like you’re being left behind.The first three chapters, on Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, were so good I read them twice. Their broad remit means they touch on lots of different things, with one astonishing idea thrown in after the other. Mind-body dualism from a physicists perspective: “When an animal learns something, it can do something different than it could before, and its brain cells must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms. In what way is it different?”The final three chapters, on the Conservation of Energy, the Theory of Gravitation and Quantum behaviour are a little heavier, but no less interesting. There’s the occasional formula, which immediately starts the eyes glazing over, but, to the lay reader, they serve to remind you just how much of the book is mathematics translated into wonderful, approachable prose. I’ve read about things like Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle or the “double-slit” experiment, which showed that at the quantum level particles behave both waves and particles, many times before, but is actually the first time that I really *got it*. For that, I cannot recommend the book enough. For those looking for more pop-physics in a similar vein, I can really recommend Why Does E=MC2 by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw, Quantum by Manjit Kumar and Black Holes, Worm Holes and Time Machines by Jim Al-Khalili. Having now read Six Easy Pieces, I can see the obvious influence of Feynman on the not just their content but their delivery and style.There are also three prefaces to the edition of the book I read. Paul Davies’ introduction and David Goldstein’s special preface set the backdrop to the book and the lectures. The most interesting preface is the one written by Feynman himself for the original edition, in which he talks about how he set about piecing the course together, who it was aimed at and why, and how ultimately he felt that he had let his students down in some way. It shows just how much thought he put into the lectures and just how much he cared about educating his students. In some way, as someone enjoys teaching and talking about science, I learnt a lot from these few pages as I did from the rest of the book. Its 50 years since The Feynman Lectures on Physics were published. Our understanding of the universe, and particularly quantum mechanics, has moved on in leaps and bounds but at no point did Six Easy Pieces feel like it was out of date because Feynman’s timeless ways of explaining complicated physics in uncomplicated ways.

122,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655438-courtney-lindwall,3,"Note to reader: I am not within Feynman's target demographic...So if anyone is familiar with Feynman's ""claim to fame,"" it's basically the idea that he's the most brilliant Physicis teacher of the 20th century and his lectures are ingenius in both their presentation and method. Now, I'm not the most science-inclined person out there. I've never taken even a preliminary physics course (and these lectures were intended for his intro Caltech class, so...). But I'm also not dumb as a rock, either. With that said, I didn't understand much of this book. I could follow along vaguely and in general terms. But could I explain to someone else what gravitational energy is now? Definitely not. In fact, I can barely remember the different topics in the book now because of how little I actually retained about them.For people who think this is going to be a magical book that will teach what were once almost mysteriously complicated ideas with wonderful simplicity - think again. You would never become truly knowledgeable on any of these topics with only this small of an overview. But, if you are scientifically inclined, it might at least be interesting and prompt you to take your learning further. It does get more technical than I thought it would. Although nowhere near as technical as the topics actually go.All in all, I didn't really enjoy it. Which is why it's 3 stars. But I could see its merit for Physics students and it did bring to light various big questions about science in general, which is why it didn't get 2 or 1. "

125,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14129090-laoonatic,5,"I think that, when reading this book, you have to be familiar with physics and maths. There are a lot of books claiming to be for the neophytes in physics/maths/astrology etc. but, truth be told, there is little to be learned when in that position. Which is why people shouldn't consider this book as being no good just because they haven't reached the paradise of enlightment which was promised to them. Such a thing isn't possible. Not from a single book, as far as I know, and anyway, not from this one. I've been studying both maths and physics for quite some time, but in the manner of a poorly prepared educational system, meaning the focus was more on solving problems and ingesting pages of theory and less on really understanding them. And Feynman's lessons really shed some light on the mess in my head. I can't claim I thoroughly understood everything in this book, but I surely enjoyed Feynman's way of following gradually to smaller scales what happens in an apparently simple process, until he reaches the ""core"" of it.Also, you can't ignore his way of being even poetic at times, which is really why this book won my heart. I have a weakness for science being romanticized. And all ovations go to Richard Feynman for doing this so tactfully."
126,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53036232-rebecca,3,"so this book (if you were at all interested) is a collection of the six 'most basic' lectures delivered by richard feynman when he taught caltech 1st year physics undergrads in the early 1960s. feynman is famously an excellent communicator and very good at explaining physics-y things and coming up with analogies. honestly though, i was a little disappointed.admittedly, i thought the chapter on quantum behaviour (6) was *fantastic*, and probably the best and most thorough explanation i've come across. the maths was a little elusive and unexplained, but that didn't bother me too much as i'm sure i'll learn about it in time & it's not necessary to understand what's going on. but i would definitely recommend this chapter (which you can read online for free - http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.ed...) to anyone to wants to understand quantum behaviour. + i did also enjoy the first two chapters in the book as well, which were on atoms in motion and basic physics.the rest of the book, however, was quite meh. the chapter on the relationship between physics and other sciences (3) was often very vague and seemed to be stating the obvious a lot of the time, although i did find it quite interesting in places (for instance the section on geology and biology, even if the latter seemed to drag on a bit). chapter (4) which was on conservation of energy was pretty confusing sometimes and otherwise pretty unmemorable.so, pretty hit and miss... 2.5 stars? "
127,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11233506-christopher,4,A really lucid introduction to physics—lecture style. 
128,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"In these lectures, Feynman is very good at explaining some basic concepts for those fairly new to physics. For field theory, he uses the analogy of waves in a pool to show how motion in one place affects motion in a distant place. He says that matter goes straight unless acted upon by an external force, but we don't know why; that the earth is pulled toward the sun, as opposed to the earth moving around the sun; and that atoms are always in motion (""jigglings and wigglings of atoms"") and that such movement increases with the application of heat. Feynman stimulates some interesting issues and questions. Under the principle of conservation of energy, the overall amount of energy remains constant; only re-arrangement of energy/atoms occurs. Feynman states that in joining together, atoms ""like certain particular partners, certain particular directions, and so on."" In this way he explains why atom combinations (attraction) take particular forms and resist being something other than such forms. This 'integrity' at the quantum level suggests a 'social' context where atoms interact with each other for particular 'reasons' and that an 'inner character' lies at the heart of quantum physics, as opposed to randomness. Feynman also writes that atoms ""want"" and that ""It is the job of physics to analyze why each one wants what it wants."" ""Want"" is an interesting choice of words. He defines inertia by saying that ""If something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.)"" Does the reference to ""coasting"" mean that a body is passively carried along in space? If so, carried by what, and what is space? Feynman says we don't really know what energy is, but does it involve a 'power' differential where matter and energy move to states of equilibrium? If this is so, then is this one way that gravity (differences in mass and distance) might have a parallel at the quantum level (weight of atoms as they combine or recombine)? Feynman writes that ""all planets push and pull each other."" If ""pull"" is attraction of bodies to each other, it's not clear what push means. For that matter, it's also not clear how ""push and pull"" relate to Einstein's spacetime curvature (oddly, Feynman discusses Einstein's relativity only briefly). Regarding push-pull (attraction-resistance) Feynman makes some suggestive comments when he states that ""the force of electricity between two charged objects looks just like the law of gravitation...."" In describing the earth's movement around the sun, Feynman says that the earth impinges ""on more particles which are coming from its forward side than from its hind side."" Does this mean that the earth ""bunches up space"" (""particles"") as it moves through its orbit and is this related to the earth's gravity? Elsewhere, Feynman states that ""the earth can be understood to be round merely because everything attracts everything else and so it has attracted itself together as far as it can!"" Gravity is not some (mystical) force at the center of the earth, but a pulling of matter and energy inward, against itself, toward the center. While this is all fun stuff to think about, these Feynman lectures do not enlighten much a lay person's understanding of the uncertainty principle, annhilation and antimatter, and absolute time. His last lecture on quantum behavior is particularly difficult. Feynman is at his best discussing the role of doubt and uncertainty in science. When he differs with the theories of the past or of his contemporaries, he seems respectful enough, saying that they are not wrong, but ""a little wrong"" or ""incomplete."" His footnote at the bottom of p. 59 directly challenges those who say wonder and awe are the province of poetry and religion, not science. He also blends life and non-life together when he says that ""'Everything is made of atoms....there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.'"" This is Feynman at his best, and a good challenge for those attempting to put philosophy on a solid materialistic foundation.  "
129,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61033954-m-r,4,"Great book. Feynman is as enigmatic as usual and his descriptions are vivid and inspiring. He begins discussing atoms and shows us how we can understand the world around us using the simple concept of 'jiggling' atoms. I found this to be a profound and exiting way of understanding how things truly work, for example, why does tea cool down when we blow on it? Well, we cause some of the atoms (well molecules in reality) of the tea to get so excited and jiggly that they break away from the liquid and fly off into the air. The more jiggly they are to start with, the more likely they are to break off, thus the tea gets less jiggly and jigglyness is equivalent to heat. Hence the tea gets cooler. The sections on conversational energy, Gravitation and Quantum mechanics are a little basic but interesting nonetheless (after all these are the easy pieces)! "
130,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,I think it is very rare for someone to be not only brilliant but also a wonderful teacher. Feynman has a very clear and direct style of imparting information. I just love it. Not quite as good as his autobiographical one but still very good. 
131,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5413456-gina,3,"Apparently these are the 6 ""easiest to understand"" (despite the inclusion of quantum mechanics!"") of the Feynman lectures. Some of them flit too much from one thing to another; I'm sure they were interesting as lectures but they are not the ideal way to read about a topic. However, the way Feynman explains certain concrete idea is really interesting; in particular the chapter on quantum mechanics is good and easy to follow. I'm on the fence as to whether to read the full set of lectures."
132,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,4,"In the early 1960s the renown physicist, Richard Feynman, delivered introductory courses on physics to first and second year undergraduate students at Caltech, in the USA. His lectures were very popular at the time and whilst aimed at undergraduates, it wasn't uncommon for graduate physics students to infiltrate his classes; the one thing Feynman could be assured of was a full house each time he came to teach this course. The lectures, after some editing, were published in three large volumes. To provide a flavour of the overall series, this book extracts just six from the collection and, as the title of this book suggests, these are regarded as being six of the easier ones to understand. They're entitled ""Atoms in motion"", ""Basic physics, ""The relation of physics to other sciences"", ""Conservation of energy"", ""The theory of gravitation"" and ""Quantum behaviour"". (There is a companion volume published under the title ""Six not-so-easy pieces"" but I've not attempted to read that.) I was attracted to this book not so much by the subject matter, but more by my interest in Feynman himself. He has a solid reputation for being an inspirational teacher and I was keen to see how he managed to achieve this. I was expecting him to take a different strategy from the norm and I wasn't disappointed. To illustrate what I mean, in his lecture on the atom he didn't follow the conventional approach of describing the structure of atoms and building up from there, yet by the end of the talk his students would have heard a physicist's explanation of why blowing on a bowl of soup cools it down. His approach to teaching was so different to what is usually done.Understandably, given the date of the lectures, there have been major developments in physics, and science in general, since the lectures were first presented. For instance, the talk on nuclear physics is very out of date because the make-up of protons and neutrons was not understand at that time to the extent that it is now. Likewise, the lecture covering the links between physics and biology pre-dates the discovery of the genetic code. Therefore, it is pointless reading this book to gain an understanding of the latest theories. Nevertheless, not everything has changed in 50 years and some lectures are as relevant today as they were then. For example, the lecture on the conservation of energy was wonderfully presented, especially the section on potential energy where Feynman used illustrated examples to explain the conservation of potential energy in reversible machines. On the other hand, I felt he made heavy weather of his account of the two slit experiment in his lecture on quantum mechanics and I've read much better explanations elsewhere. To a marked extent Feynman did over complicate much of his material but this is to expected since his stated intention was to teach to slightly beyond the level of the brightest students in each class; of course, whether or not this was the best strategy is open to debate.Overall, this book of six ""easy"" lectures provides remarkable insight into Feynman's style of teaching. He comes across as someone who knew his subject matter inside out, who had boundless energy and complete self-confidence, and who wanted to stretch the minds of his students."
133,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/896694-mark,2,"If you have heard about the ""weirdness"" of quantum mechanics but don't know what the hype is all about, look no further than chapter six of this book. In chapter six, with his usual down-to-earth approach, Feynman describes one of the most famous experiments in physics (the double-slit experiment) and what it tells us about the way fundamental particles behave. He compares the behavior of ""lumps"" to the behavior of ""waves"" before moving on to the behavior of electrons... and the outcome might surprise you (it surprised early 20th-century physicists, too). This is a classic lesson in quantum mechanics taught by one of the classic teachers of physics. And there's no math required.I only gave this book two stars because the other five lectures in this book aren't overly memorable and come nowhere near to being Feynman's greatest lessons. But chapter six alone makes this book worth picking up, especially if you want an introduction to wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, and the conundrum of quantum measurement that is accessible to the layperson but that also demands that you stretch your mind. It's a brief introduction that cuts to the essence of what is going on and, while giving you a decent grounding, will leave you ready to dig deeper and learn more."
134,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104304660-elsie,1,"The thing that bothers me about this is that physics sounds interesting in a book like this but I did my high school physics and first year physics at university and the core of it, the thing you had to learn and understand want the fascinating results and conclusions, it was the collection of vast amounts of data and then the math. The formulas, the statistical analysis, the endless calculation. It's math (maths?). It's all math. And math is beautiful sometimes but it's also a huge amount of grunt learning. I could have recited everything in this book and completely failed every exam in first year university physics if I did. I didn't fail though. Instead I learn how to use the formulas and solve problem questions. That's how you pass. Maybe I'm just bitter but none of this was part of my first year physics 😜"
135,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,5,"4.5/5 starsI picked up this book several months ago and then dropped it despite nearly finishing it due to the complexity of the last chapter: Quantum Behavior. This by no means implies that the book is difficult as a whole.I thoroughly enjoyed the first three chapters: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relations of Physics to Other Sciences. The method he chose to explain the concepts in these chapters was elegant and easy to understand. He compared our understanding the law of physics to watching a game of chess played by the gods (not personal gods) and we humans as observers knowing nothing about the chess rules. However, I have difficulty with understanding quantum mechanics when he started involving mathematic equation, which I particularly have no formal education. I might as well come back to this chapter once I have a better understanding of mathematics.Overall, I would recommend ""Six Easy Pieces"" to anyone who is interested in science, physics especially, to check it out. You might have already known the concepts, but you'll be amazed by his styles."

For someone like me (i.e., a layperson that has no background in physics whatsoever), this is a great introduction to the mysterious world of physics—it is humorous and accessible and makes an effort to be ""approximately accurate"" about everything (while calling itself out on things that are simplified for the sake of the example or else ""unknown or unknowable""). However, to be ""approximately accurate about everything"" means a bunch of math and other fancy-pants equations that look like this:|ĥ₁ + ĥ₂|² = |ĥ₁|² + |ĥ₂|² + 2|ĥ₁||ĥ₂| cos δ...which despite my best efforts remain cloaked in physics' mysterious shroud.""Easy Pieces"", these are not.However, Feynman explains the subject matter well—and certainly better than most other folks that have tried to write this sort of thing.I'm adding him to my short list of heroes."

As I read the book, I felt myself opening up to the concept of atoms, amalgamations, energy, astronomy, gravity, light years, colliders and quantum physics. There was humor, history and simplified experiments in the book, too, which gave the field of Physics an ""inviting"" feeling, rather than a snooty one. The first five chapters were wonderful, but I struggled quite a bit with Chapter 6. To be clear: I still have no grasp on these difficult theories and concepts but now I feel like I have a genuine appreciation for the science and a new way of looking at our world. I learned something that is diffiuclt for me to articulate but I will try: I learned that Physics truly welcomes the connection between past and present, quantum leaps and forward thoughts, the galaxy and a glass of wine, a spiritual presence and Dennis the Menace and much, much more.

It goes without saying that Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winner in Physics, is beyond brilliant....but I said it anyway. I enjoy his writing & his joy of discovery in all things scientific. If I'd had a Physics professor like him maybe I would've understood it or had more interest in physical sciences. That said, I found this book very interesting and informative but the formulas & concepts were sometimes a little foreign to me. He was aiming for the brightest of his CalTech first year Physics students & I think I'm missing a little bit of their experience/education in Physics. I found it illuminating; however, I don't think I could explain what I learned without re-reading some sections. I'll probably read some other books by him because I enjoy his ""joie de vivre"".

Physics is probably the most significant science of all time. It has had its impact already on many fronts. There'd be no transistors or cell phones without physics. If we don't apply Einstein's equations into the satellites we build, our GPS will render useless. Physics also has an intimate relationship with other scientific fields like astronomy, chemistry, biology, etc. I think this book is relatively easy to understand even if you have no background in physics. There are times though you may feel a bit out of your depth, especially as we get into the mystifying realm of quantum mechanics. Be that as it may, it is still a good source of knowledge for the physics majors as well as laypeople. You have to read the book with the caveat that it was written back in the 1960's and so a lot were not known back then. For instance, the strong nuclear force was not discovered yet. hope you enjoy."

The publisher created this volume (and a second one that I am just getting into called ""Six Not-So-Easy Pieces"") and a companion audio book in Feynman's own voice about 15 years ago.Although they are not biographical, and I took ""freshman physics"" a while ago, I picked up these two volumes to read how this man attempted to re-invent the teaching of introductory and intermediate physics. The approaches and ""patter"" are definitely Feynman's own. His thinking, humor, and enjoyment of ""natural philosophy"" shine through the pages.Granted the knowledge of cosmology and particle physics contained in this volume are dated (it was 45 years ago, give the guy a break!), but that only adds a patina of warmth to the presentation.The title is correct: there is virtually no math in this volume (except a bit near the end). Nothing that you need to fear: blowing over it will still get you the gist of the point(s).If you have read any of the other books relating Feynman's adventures as a young (20s) man working at Los Alamos, the pick this up and see how the man lived and breathed physics.

I didn't like some of them probably because I didn't understand them, and to be fair I didn't focus a lot while reading it, it was more of a leisure read. The gravitational piece was beautiful. It explained big complex ideas with simple analogies that made sense, some of the laws he discussed I knew already but after reading the lecture it all clicked and the picture was more clear. I didn't like the conservation of energy or quantum mechanics, which makes sense for quantum mechanics because, well. However I actually studied the conservation of energy and liked it, I was excited to get a new perspective on it and to get deeper intuition but the analogies did not make any sense and it all was just too confusing. Which is why I think rather than a book it would've been better if I just read lectures on the topics that interest me. I still enjoyed the book and I would probably read Feynman again in the future along with my physics courses. "

Hawking and Greene have done much to popularize (and fetishize) physics, but Feynman will help the layperson really start to understand it at its most conceptual, basic form. And if you haven't the ability to sustain fifteen years of advanced mathematics, these lessons can still illuminate the marvels of the ""mechanism.""To be fair, Hawking (astrophysics) and Greene (quantum mechanics) both do a lot for their respective fields as well, but they aren't Feynman.Oh, by the way, I can't perform the most basic algebraic equations. That is so embarassing."

I'm not sure this short book succeeds in achieving that goal. It isn't thorough enough or organized well enough to teach people who haven't already been exposed to physics something useful about the subject. If you have dipped your toes in the fascinating world of physics, however, this is definitely worth reading. This book won't teach you anything new but it'll give you new eyes and a new way of looking at some of the central problems of physics. This is where Feynman really shines; he provides some unique and brilliant insights that sometimes change the way you think about a problem and make you go, Aha! The first three chapters explain what physics really is, what doing physics entails, and how physics relates to the other sciences. In the final three chapters, Feynman gets into real physics and discusses conservation of energy, theory of gravitation, and quantum behavior. In the chapter on the theory of gravity, Feynman provides a historic account of its development from Copernicus to Newton and shows us what particular problem each of them was trying to solve and what their contribution was which is really helpful. The other two chapters are also very interesting. There are some simple equations in there but nothing you wouldn't already have seen elsewhere. Feynman frequently surprises you with his refreshing attitude of saying, ""We don't know why that is"", thereby pointing out the limits of existing (during his time) scientific knowledge. I strongly recommend this book to those with a keen interest in physics, not to learn anything new but to get a Feynman-eye-view of basic physics. Also check out its sister volume, The Six Not-So-Easy Pieces."

The links between cornerstone concepts of physics, chemistry and biology reappeared in a completely different light. The author takes you on an exciting ""understanding tour"" starting with the atomic hypothesis, then placing all basic concepts in both historical and cross-science perspectives to consequently elaborate on the 6 conservations laws (energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, charge, baryons and leptons), gravitational and relativistic discussions to finally serve the quantum behaviour ""explanation"".All packaged in supercilious (100% deservedly!) wrapping of Feynman's unique style.That book should replace (or at least accompany) all first-year school physics lectures!"

Even though the title of Feynman’s book is Six Easy Pieces, it wasn’t easy in a dumbed down sort of way.

159,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

161,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10486977-themadhatter,4,"This book contains a transcript of a subset (six) lectures from a series that Feynman delivered in the 1960s. While the title says ""easy"" - it is keeping in mind that these were lectures for the best and brightest at Caltech...so yes, while they are not overly complex, they are also not designed for the novice either. Five of the lectures cover concepts in classical physics (energy, gravitation etc) and the role of physics in society. However, it is the final chapter on quantum which is the gold mine in this book (especially regarding the Uncertainty Principle).I am a massive Feynman fan and he is widely notes as one of the best (and most engaging) physics teachers of the 20th century and while this book was good and definitely worth picking up, I am not sure whether I would call it great as some of the magic of Feynman just didn't translate as well as I was hoping to the written page. Well worth the read."
162,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46917424-rami,5,"The way that Feynman goes by explaining the topics of this book reminded me of Stephen Hawking's books about the universe. I did enjoy the analogies the author uses to explain some principles that are not always easy to grasp, particularly about our our knowledge of the laws discussed.I found myself discovering new ideas and seeing things from a new perspective even after several years in engineering, having already read and studies most of the content of this book before, but never from this angle.Would definitely recommend it as an entry point to people who want more insight into modern day physics."
163,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094533-mary-overton,0,"Lectures from a series given at Caltech in the early 60s - intended for freshmen, to stimulate their interest in physics. Special Preface: ""Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that's not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered students started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience."" pp. xxii-xxiii""'Quantum mechanics' is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."" pg. 116""Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience."" pg. 117 ""We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics....We can only predict the odds!.... We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."" pg. 135"
164,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30489708-alcatraz-dey,4,"This book is a brilliant way to broaden your knowledge of the key concepts of physics. Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."
165,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"This book is an introduction to the most basic ideas of physics, and part of its sophistication is that it hints at how deep the...rabbit hole...is, without requiring readers to have enough expertise to really go down it.It was readable but challenging for me - someone with a bachelor's in biology and no great adeptitude for physics or math. My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
166,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
167,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."
168,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"Non-fiction. This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."
169,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336491-laura,2,"I may be one of the few scientists who is not a Feynman fan. He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."

A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."
171,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4333246-lauren,5,"Feynman never ceases to amaze me with his genuine ability to take a complicated subject (or concept) and make it accessible to the masses. After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe. If you want a book that will truly keep you on your toes and thinking, pick this one up. "
172,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22224713-john-gribbin,4,"One of the biggest influences on my scientific career, and later my career as a populariser of science, was the multi-volume Feynman Lectures on Physics which appeared in the early 1960s. This epitome of that masterwork really does offer an easy guide to what physics, and science in general, is all about. Feynman explores the most fundamental scientific theories that all intelligent people should be aware of – the structure and behaviour of atoms, quantum mechanics and gravity. These are the fundamentals that ought to be as well known as Shakespeare, Mozart and Picasso. The material is essentially a transcript of Feynman lecturing (you can even get the lectures themselves on a CD to accompany the book), and comes across like a wise friend giving you the inside story on a subject he loves."

In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

191,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10486977-themadhatter,4,"This book contains a transcript of a subset (six) lectures from a series that Feynman delivered in the 1960s. While the title says ""easy"" - it is keeping in mind that these were lectures for the best and brightest at Caltech...so yes, while they are not overly complex, they are also not designed for the novice either. Five of the lectures cover concepts in classical physics (energy, gravitation etc) and the role of physics in society. However, it is the final chapter on quantum which is the gold mine in this book (especially regarding the Uncertainty Principle).I am a massive Feynman fan and he is widely notes as one of the best (and most engaging) physics teachers of the 20th century and while this book was good and definitely worth picking up, I am not sure whether I would call it great as some of the magic of Feynman just didn't translate as well as I was hoping to the written page. Well worth the read."
192,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46917424-rami,5,"The way that Feynman goes by explaining the topics of this book reminded me of Stephen Hawking's books about the universe. I did enjoy the analogies the author uses to explain some principles that are not always easy to grasp, particularly about our our knowledge of the laws discussed.I found myself discovering new ideas and seeing things from a new perspective even after several years in engineering, having already read and studies most of the content of this book before, but never from this angle.Would definitely recommend it as an entry point to people who want more insight into modern day physics."
193,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094533-mary-overton,0,"Lectures from a series given at Caltech in the early 60s - intended for freshmen, to stimulate their interest in physics. Special Preface: ""Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that's not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered students started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience."" pp. xxii-xxiii""'Quantum mechanics' is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."" pg. 116""Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience."" pg. 117 ""We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics....We can only predict the odds!.... We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."" pg. 135"
194,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30489708-alcatraz-dey,4,"This book is a brilliant way to broaden your knowledge of the key concepts of physics. Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."
195,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"This book is an introduction to the most basic ideas of physics, and part of its sophistication is that it hints at how deep the...rabbit hole...is, without requiring readers to have enough expertise to really go down it.It was readable but challenging for me - someone with a bachelor's in biology and no great adeptitude for physics or math. My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
196,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
197,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."
198,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"Non-fiction. This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."
199,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336491-laura,2,"I may be one of the few scientists who is not a Feynman fan. He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."
200,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,5,"Feynman, the debonair physicist of the last generation. Part physicist, part bongo player, part safe cracker, all man. A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."
201,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4333246-lauren,5,"Feynman never ceases to amaze me with his genuine ability to take a complicated subject (or concept) and make it accessible to the masses. After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe. If you want a book that will truly keep you on your toes and thinking, pick this one up. "
202,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22224713-john-gribbin,4,"One of the biggest influences on my scientific career, and later my career as a populariser of science, was the multi-volume Feynman Lectures on Physics which appeared in the early 1960s. This epitome of that masterwork really does offer an easy guide to what physics, and science in general, is all about. Feynman explores the most fundamental scientific theories that all intelligent people should be aware of – the structure and behaviour of atoms, quantum mechanics and gravity. These are the fundamentals that ought to be as well known as Shakespeare, Mozart and Picasso. The material is essentially a transcript of Feynman lecturing (you can even get the lectures themselves on a CD to accompany the book), and comes across like a wise friend giving you the inside story on a subject he loves."
203,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37210284-yiheng-wang,4,"As an educator in STEM discipline, I started to read this book (primarily) hoping to glean some ideas on how to explain the basics of physics to other people in vivid but simple words. In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."
204,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6468380-taylor-pearson,4,"One of my major regrets from college was that I didn’t take more math and physics courses. The departments for both at my school were fairly challenging and I wasn’t particularly good at them and so I shied away for fear they would hurt my GPA.As it turns out, no one has ever asked to see my GPA and I would have been better off taking the classes, getting Cs and learning a lot. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book. Feynman is an astoundingly good teacher, with a real facility for metaphors and analogies that make the subject matter easy to grasp."
205,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44618-alisha,2,"I got this book as a gift, & was excited about it. It ended up not being quite as enjoyable as I expected. I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

He had a lively mind and spirit that helped him connect to the kids. Hell, he was a kid, just with an oversized brain. He believed that if physics was so great, so cool, so awesome that it should be understandable by the many not the few. Therefore, he tried to teach it in pictures or models rather than math. He failed but, he was one cool, smart dude for thinking this way. Want to see this question explored more? Read my book, Black Body Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe.

Richard Feynman inspired people around the world with his scientific brilliance, endless curiosity about the world and unorthodox outlook on life. Here he guides the reader through the very basics of physics, including atoms, energy, force, the relation of physics to other sciences, the theory of gravitation and quantum behaviour.

Could even be zero. I'm uncertain about how I feel, truly). Six ""Easy"" Pieces is definitely not as easy as you would expect. The first 3 chapters were outstandingly brilliant and easy to catch. The following two were outstandingly brilliant too, but a bit harder. And then came the quantum mechanics chapter. Which left my head's angular momentum uncertain. :3My recommendation: 10/10 for physics people, 6/10 for laymen."

Many college professors should read Feynman, as they may learn about the performance of teaching. Just because you are intelligent doesn't mean you have to make difficult concepts overly complicated.

In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

224,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30489708-alcatraz-dey,4,"This book is a brilliant way to broaden your knowledge of the key concepts of physics. Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."
225,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"This book is an introduction to the most basic ideas of physics, and part of its sophistication is that it hints at how deep the...rabbit hole...is, without requiring readers to have enough expertise to really go down it.It was readable but challenging for me - someone with a bachelor's in biology and no great adeptitude for physics or math. My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
226,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
227,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."
228,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"Non-fiction. This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."
229,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336491-laura,2,"I may be one of the few scientists who is not a Feynman fan. He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."

A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."

After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe.

This epitome of that masterwork really does offer an easy guide to what physics, and science in general, is all about. Feynman explores the most fundamental scientific theories that all intelligent people should be aware of – the structure and behaviour of atoms, quantum mechanics and gravity. These are the fundamentals that ought to be as well known as Shakespeare, Mozart and Picasso. The material is essentially a transcript of Feynman lecturing (you can even get the lectures themselves on a CD to accompany the book), and comes across like a wise friend giving you the inside story on a subject he loves."

In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

249,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
256,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
257,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."
258,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"Non-fiction. This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."
259,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336491-laura,2,"I may be one of the few scientists who is not a Feynman fan. He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."
260,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,5,"Feynman, the debonair physicist of the last generation. Part physicist, part bongo player, part safe cracker, all man. A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."
261,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4333246-lauren,5,"Feynman never ceases to amaze me with his genuine ability to take a complicated subject (or concept) and make it accessible to the masses. After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe. If you want a book that will truly keep you on your toes and thinking, pick this one up. "
262,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22224713-john-gribbin,4,"One of the biggest influences on my scientific career, and later my career as a populariser of science, was the multi-volume Feynman Lectures on Physics which appeared in the early 1960s. This epitome of that masterwork really does offer an easy guide to what physics, and science in general, is all about. Feynman explores the most fundamental scientific theories that all intelligent people should be aware of – the structure and behaviour of atoms, quantum mechanics and gravity. These are the fundamentals that ought to be as well known as Shakespeare, Mozart and Picasso. The material is essentially a transcript of Feynman lecturing (you can even get the lectures themselves on a CD to accompany the book), and comes across like a wise friend giving you the inside story on a subject he loves."
263,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37210284-yiheng-wang,4,"As an educator in STEM discipline, I started to read this book (primarily) hoping to glean some ideas on how to explain the basics of physics to other people in vivid but simple words. In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

The departments for both at my school were fairly challenging and I wasn’t particularly good at them and so I shied away for fear they would hurt my GPA.As it turns out, no one has ever asked to see my GPA and I would have been better off taking the classes, getting Cs and learning a lot. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

279,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."

While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about.

I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it.

Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious.

This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."

He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."

A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."

After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe. If you want a book that will truly keep you on your toes and thinking, pick this one up. "

This epitome of that masterwork really does offer an easy guide to what physics, and science in general, is all about. Feynman explores the most fundamental scientific theories that all intelligent people should be aware of – the structure and behaviour of atoms, quantum mechanics and gravity. These are the fundamentals that ought to be as well known as Shakespeare, Mozart and Picasso. The material is essentially a transcript of Feynman lecturing (you can even get the lectures themselves on a CD to accompany the book), and comes across like a wise friend giving you the inside story on a subject he loves."

In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

The departments for both at my school were fairly challenging and I wasn’t particularly good at them and so I shied away for fear they would hurt my GPA.As it turns out, no one has ever asked to see my GPA and I would have been better off taking the classes, getting Cs and learning a lot. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

309,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

Five of the lectures cover concepts in classical physics (energy, gravitation etc) and the role of physics in society. However, it is the final chapter on quantum which is the gold mine in this book (especially regarding the Uncertainty Principle).I am a massive Feynman fan and he is widely notes as one of the best (and most engaging) physics teachers of the 20th century and while this book was good and definitely worth picking up, I am not sure whether I would call it great as some of the magic of Feynman just didn't translate as well as I was hoping to the written page.

Special Preface: ""Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that's not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered students started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience."" pp. xxii-xxiii""'Quantum mechanics' is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."" pg. 116""Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience."" pg. 117 ""We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics....We can only predict the odds!.... We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."" pg. 135"
314,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30489708-alcatraz-dey,4,"This book is a brilliant way to broaden your knowledge of the key concepts of physics. Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."

My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared...

All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded.

After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe. If you want a book that will truly keep you on your toes and thinking, pick this one up. "

This epitome of that masterwork really does offer an easy guide to what physics, and science in general, is all about. Feynman explores the most fundamental scientific theories that all intelligent people should be aware of – the structure and behaviour of atoms, quantum mechanics and gravity. These are the fundamentals that ought to be as well known as Shakespeare, Mozart and Picasso. The material is essentially a transcript of Feynman lecturing (you can even get the lectures themselves on a CD to accompany the book), and comes across like a wise friend giving you the inside story on a subject he loves."

In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

The departments for both at my school were fairly challenging and I wasn’t particularly good at them and so I shied away for fear they would hurt my GPA.As it turns out, no one has ever asked to see my GPA and I would have been better off taking the classes, getting Cs and learning a lot. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

339,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

While the title says ""easy"" - it is keeping in mind that these were lectures for the best and brightest at Caltech...so yes, while they are not overly complex, they are also not designed for the novice either. Five of the lectures cover concepts in classical physics (energy, gravitation etc) and the role of physics in society. However, it is the final chapter on quantum which is the gold mine in this book (especially regarding the Uncertainty Principle).I am a massive Feynman fan and he is widely notes as one of the best (and most engaging) physics teachers of the 20th century and while this book was good and definitely worth picking up, I am not sure whether I would call it great as some of the magic of Feynman just didn't translate as well as I was hoping to the written page. Well worth the read."

Special Preface: ""Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that's not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered students started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience."" pp. xxii-xxiii""'Quantum mechanics' is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."" pg. 116""Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience."" pg. 117 ""We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics....We can only predict the odds!.... We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."" pg. 135"
344,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30489708-alcatraz-dey,4,"This book is a brilliant way to broaden your knowledge of the key concepts of physics. Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."
345,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"This book is an introduction to the most basic ideas of physics, and part of its sophistication is that it hints at how deep the...rabbit hole...is, without requiring readers to have enough expertise to really go down it.It was readable but challenging for me - someone with a bachelor's in biology and no great adeptitude for physics or math. My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
346,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about.

It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."

After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe. If you want a book that will truly keep you on your toes and thinking, pick this one up. "
352,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22224713-john-gribbin,4,"One of the biggest influences on my scientific career, and later my career as a populariser of science, was the multi-volume Feynman Lectures on Physics which appeared in the early 1960s. This epitome of that masterwork really does offer an easy guide to what physics, and science in general, is all about. Feynman explores the most fundamental scientific theories that all intelligent people should be aware of – the structure and behaviour of atoms, quantum mechanics and gravity. These are the fundamentals that ought to be as well known as Shakespeare, Mozart and Picasso. The material is essentially a transcript of Feynman lecturing (you can even get the lectures themselves on a CD to accompany the book), and comes across like a wise friend giving you the inside story on a subject he loves."
353,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37210284-yiheng-wang,4,"As an educator in STEM discipline, I started to read this book (primarily) hoping to glean some ideas on how to explain the basics of physics to other people in vivid but simple words. In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

The departments for both at my school were fairly challenging and I wasn’t particularly good at them and so I shied away for fear they would hurt my GPA.As it turns out, no one has ever asked to see my GPA and I would have been better off taking the classes, getting Cs and learning a lot. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

373,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6470362-jean-tessier,5,"I while back, I bought a book that introduced math topics to the lay person. This looked like it could do the same for physics. And by none other than Richard Feynman himself.Feynman goes for a more intuitive approach and avoids any complex mathematics. His explanations and examples are strikingly clear. The jiggling of atoms explain the difference between solid, liquid, and gaseous states. Changing arrangements explain chemical reactions, like burning carbon. Everything is made out of atoms, with patterns that defy the imagination.I struggled through the chapter on the conservation of energy. One take-away is that we can explain limits in nature using reversible machines, even though there are no reversible machines in nature. The chapters on gravitation and quantum mechanics were exceedingly clear. The chapter on how physics relates to the other sciences was a lot of fun. So, too, the chapter on gravitation.Tycho Brahe had an idea that was different from anything proposed by the ancients [...] that to find something out, it is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophical arguments. (p. 90) Tycho Brahe took measurements, Kepler deduced laws from these measurements, Galileo figured out inertia, and Newton formulated the law of gravitation (which was later refined by Einstein).I really like how Feynman repeatedly states the limits of science. There are many things that we simply do not know. For now. There may be things we will never know, but many phenomena in the past were deemed inexplicable, only to be explained later.It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. (p. 71) the principle of inertia — if something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.) (p. 93) All we have done is to describe how the earth moves around the sun, but we have not said what makes it go. (p. 107) No one has since given any machinery. (p. 107) Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. (p. 116) Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. (p. 117) According to Feynman, the fact that there are things we do not know does not mean that we are ignorant. We can explain the limits of how things operate with great precision, even though we cannot explain why.About the conservation of energy:There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law -- it is exact so far as we know. (p. 69) As I was reading the book, I often found myself wondering how much progress we've made since it had been written. For instance, in last year's Outgrowing God, Richard Dawkins makes a case for complex chemistry inevitably leads to self-replicating molecules like RNA and DNA, and eventually living organisms.Feynman does not reduce everything to physics. He acknowledges that there are areas of human knowledge outside of science.If something is said not to be a science, it does not mean that there something wrong with it; it just means that it is not a science. (p. 47) "
374,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115843326-liquidlasagna,2,"I adore Feynman, but i don't like reading this book...Why you ask?I find that the pieces were far more easily read in the Feynman Lecture's on physics because of the larger page size, and even the smoother better quality paper.Trying to put those lectures to fit into a smaller book, i find actually makes re-reading the lectures harder. I'm not a fan of the paper and the typeface size, and well to me, it takes away from the smooth flow of the much bigger pages of the original book.It just gives me a claustrophobic feeling.---I need those lectures with the pages extra three inches wider, and four inches taller!!---I was given the whole set, since i had trouble trying to find the original red hardcovers in good shape [they always seemed to be warped], and I found them somewhat rough going when I faced Heisenberg's Uncertainity Principle for the first time, I took a break... I took a break and tried again a while later....He was talking about calculating the orbit of one planet and I struggled in places.Anyways, i decided to take a break for a month or two, and i did exactly what Issac Newton did, i decided to reread things all over again, right from the beginning.I simply burned through the first 100-150 pages of the Feynman Lectures and enjoyed it.But i had two small moments where I realized i was rushing things, and decided, later... later...I couldn't have as much fun browsing Vol II because of the calculus, even though i had the math knowledge at the time, but not the introductory calculus-level university level EM, so browsing those early on, i realized i would face some struggles.[I actually spoke to someone once who went to Caltech in the 60s, and he said that he thought Feynman's Lectures were brutal. He couldn't remember his other textbooks, but i really appreciated his insight 20 years later]It really bums me out since Feynman's writing really is beautiful and deep, and i see a lot of slightly unhappy folks picking up this book and having a hard time with it.I totally sympathize, because i felt let down that my concentration didn't flow with the page as easily, as I thought it might with a neat little hardcover.All I can say is that lots of people who experienced the Lectures in the day, some people were frustrated, and some people were blown away, and some experienced both.----All i can say is that reread the book very slowly and patiently, or borrow a copy of Volume One of the full lectures at the library and browse through them, an read the first 30 pages.and please please please READ, Feynman's autobiography firstSurely You're Joking Mister Feynman [Part I]What Do You Care What Other People Think? [Part II]"
375,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"I read this for all the wrong reasons. It was short and I wanted one more book for the month, and I knew I could blitz through all the basic science blah. I blitzed, it wasn't basic, I learned nothing except that I was insufferable and needed to stop this obnoxious book-counting. Also, Feynman was inappropriate and a irrascible, didn't knew. The writing is easy, likeable, and clear, I really wish I'd been able to sit in on one of his lectures, those must have been incredible. But I guess I had the next best thing, Bharatidasan kicking me out for the 10th time in a week because I wasn't adequately spellbound by his reading out from the illustrated guide to the simplified extract of Indian transliteration to the official university textbook of Electrical Machines I, complete with bad grammar, formula errors, and all the sweet smelling dryness of cow-dung prepared for fuel, which is apt because those books were some of the few that deserved to be taken to 451 fahrenheit. Clippingsphilosophically we are completely wrong with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws. Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas.From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics. This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric field and charges,The masses given here are the masses of the particles at rest. The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot be at rest.it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth.When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is deflected."
376,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45200517-simon-zou,4,"This is book is great. I started to read it on the recommendation of a professor in Computer Science and because I wanted to ""like"" physics more, as opposed to thinking it's this hard, scary thing. To that end, it's worked, I like physics more than when I started. On the ""Easy"" in the title: The premise of the book is that, of Feyman's lectures on physics, these are the 6 easiest, digestable for a layman with little to no background in the sciences. So I listened to the first couple chapters as an audiobook. The audiobook uses the recordings from the real lectures and are awesome. The written version drops some of his character and jokes in exchange for clarity so it's nice to get both. Feynman waxes poetry about rocks and moons and atoms and how physics relates to other sciences and it's pretty marvelous. However, once at chapter 4, on the conservation of energy, just listening becomes untenable. There are diagrams and equations and concepts that required my full attention to grasp. I switched from listening to reading, to listening and reading at the same time, to asking myself ""at this point why don't I just watch the lectures on YouTube?"". I did that, and all was good. The explanation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics in particular would be pretty hard to get without looking at the diagrams but with them it makes sense, or rather, explains the consistent way in which quantum doesn't make sense. One thing I noticed from perusing all these mediums is that Amazon keeps track of ""popular"" highlights in books and shows them to you. These were far more prevalent in the first three chapters. I wish they made available (but understand why they don't) other stats because I would guess that chapter 4 is where people might have given up on the book. The title says these pieces are ""easy"", but the last few chapters require your full attention and some quantitative reasoning skills to grasp. It's not so easy that I could fully digest the ideas half paying attention while doing the dishes, as was closer to the case with the earlier chapters. Feynman also uses imaginary ""reversible"" machines to explain energy concepts and I'm still not sure I like that or really get what those are about."
377,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97017413-john,3,"This is quite difficult to review. I knew of Feynman (obviously) but hadn't read or seen his famous early 60s lectures before. This book exists as an introduction to the man and his teaching methods but I'm not convinced it does a particularly good job.Definitely don't read this if you want to learn anything about physics, some of the material is very dated (a lot has happened in the world of physics in the last 56 years). Some of it is still relevant but if you didn't know what how would you pick this out from the irrelevant? The blurb on the book says ""the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics"" and I would strongly dispute that.The book gets off to a decent start, the prefaces and introduction set the scene, they tell us that the lecture series wasn't actually that successful with only a few students present targetted by the material so it's hardly surprising only a few stuck with them. Lecture One (Atoms in Motion) is good, a nice introduction to Feynman's method and the subject matter is gentle and well described. But Lecture Two (Basic Physics) is a disaster IMHO, it's a complete mess with Feynman jumping all over the place and not really explaining anything properly and leaving the reader totally confused. Lecture Three (Relationship of Physics to Other Sciences) is very biology biased and spends a lot of time on enzymes. Other sciences are briefly mentioned or pretty much dismissed, geology and meteorology get very short shrift and only go to emphasise how dated the material is. Lecture Four (Conservation of Energy) is better and thank goodness for Lecture Five (Gravitation) and Lecture Six (Quantum Behaviour) which save this book as they are easily the best two and the best advertisement for Feynman. These last two lectures have the most interesting content and we can see how Feynman excels in explaining these difficult concepts.Overall the book hasn't inspired me to tackle more of Feynman's lectures although the final two lectures came close. There are better and more up to date explanations of many of the concepts tackled in this book. I think it's worth reading, it's a very short and quick read, but don't go in to it expecting to learn much physics."
378,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18566696-nitin-dangwal,4,"Richard Feynman was on my to-read list for a long time. I have heard a lot about his teaching methods. His crystal-clear thought that made him teach the most difficult subjects in the most easiest of methods. Given this, I had a lot of expectations from this book. And I was not disappointed.The book is a primer to anyone who wants to brush up their understanding of the basics in Physics. But unlike the books that we have studied, this book is not a bland narration of the concepts. Rather in your hand, this book is alive, with one of the best teachers of the physics speaking to you. Not one page of this short book is boring. And like a thriller, you turn page by page, trying to know what happens next. Almost every chapter of this gem of a book is amazing. But if asked my favorite, it has to be the chapter on Quantum Physics, and the explanation of dual nature of matter and the inherent uncertainty of the quantum world. I find Quantum Physics for one simple reason. It has confounded both physics and religious alike. So weird is the world of quantum that it makes sense to neither of them. For physicists Quantum Physics provide observation that throw everything they have learnt and beliefs down to gutter. For religious person, the quanta world is nothing short than work of devil, where the world has no order - something that they attribute to the god. And what can they so, so astonishingly is the world of quantum. Particles behave likes waves. But when you take a light source to see what is happening, they start behaving like particles again. Nothing is 'is' there. It is always they could be 60% here, and 40% there. Nothing is certain. Everything is probabilistic. Quantum world apart, I love the book majorly for one reason. It sews everything from the concept of heat to the concept of planetary motion in one single narrative. I think this is the major thing that the science education lacks in today's world. So much we have divided physics from chemistry that we don't realize they are the part of one whole story. This book fills this gap. Must read for a light and entertaining read about basic physics"
379,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89960099-john-doe,4,"Yes, it's very much an introduction. Mainly provide a ""big picture"" which chronologically connected scattered topics of modern physics, and most contents are basically high school physics stuff.But still, it's nice to intuitively connecting the dots in your mind. It's a quick read for me 😁 since I was kinda boost on physics in high school period, literally top grades in physics, favorite part was electric circuits design.If it wasn't for something random I would be the kid who loves physics and studied physics all the way up to uni, gradschool, and PhD maybe. Nevertheless I was a kid came across book with words like nuclear physics at age 5. Anyway, reading felt like a breeze after so many years literally disconnected with any physics stuff. Why I picked up physics again, because I need to understand quantum mechanics, and need to understand higher level mathematics in a physics way not merely arithmetics way. There was a lack of visual intuition in advanced pure mathematics area, I think catching up with the area of physics may be the key to develop intuitions.Another interesting point, why Mr.Feynman had a subtle distaste for philosophy?I think Mr.Feynman simply adopted the uncomformist attitude for both personal life and academic breakthrough, and most of the times the reasonings of the majority of philosophers were kind of absolute, which is the very core against what science at the age often adopted, uncertainty or statistical or probabilistic thinking, in other words, everything is by chance not that absolute as philosophers usually argued. However I think that's not a very fair judgement for philosophy the subject in general, nevertheless, the founding father of probability theory Pascal was himself a great philosopher, had profound work not just about mathematics but about thoughts for life in general. Besides, the very thought or intuition of every mathematics breakthrough IS philosophical. Therefore you can not be both anti philosophy and chasing revolutionary breakthrough in whatever area, instead you have to be kinda of philosophical."
380,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110560654-samen-yasar,5,"In the early 60s at Caltech, student interest in physics started declining sharply among undergraduates. Years of rigorous training in the basics meant undergraduates largely weren't able to engage directly with the most recent advancements in the field. To restore motivation in students, the faculty asked Feynman, already quite famous by then, to teach a course on introductory physics to the freshman and sophomore classes. The result was a wonderful series of lectures that was later transcribed and became what is known today as ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". This book contains only six of the easiest and most accessible pieces from that collection.The lectures are true to the intent. Unlike a typical physics lecture, where complex math and sophisticated jargon reigns supreme, Feynman's discussions have the bare minimum of scientific jargon and almost no math. He gets to the essence of complex concepts with just simple thought experiments and intuitive diagrams. It feels almost as if he is telling a story, when in fact he is explaining a rather complicated concept. Though he primarily focuses on basic concepts, he doesn't shy away from connecting them to more advanced concepts whenever he can. Since it was set in the 60s, some parts of the text pertaining to modern physics is a bit outdated. But those aside the text is truly remarkable.If there is any text on physics at all that I would gladly recommend to any fellow non-physicist, it has to be this series of lectures. The text's usage of simple language and the deliberate omission of math lends itself to a very wide audience. Anyone with basic high school level math and science background should be able to follow through easily."
381,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1848040-gabriella-gricius,4,"Why Read: I love physics. I honestly really truly adore learning about physics. The small caveat is that I'm absolutely horrid at it. Learning about how the universe works (not really why, as Feynman points out) is something that I am not particularly gifted in. But nonetheless, I love reading about it. Review: I picked up Six Easy Pieces an age ago. I thought that it would be a great book for me because as previously mentioned, I'm not good at the subject. The basics are most definitely something that I could use a hand in. Everyone has heard of Feynman's lectures, they're practically famous and so reading the first six ""easy"" pieces felt like something doable.Let me disabuse you of that notion. Much as I enjoyed reading this book, I didn't find it doable or easy to comprehend. The first couple chapters are okay, when you learn about gravity and about the magnetic pulls between atoms and planets - but then... then comes the quantum mechanics. Then comes the simple act that physic researchers are just trying to figure out ""how"" things work, rather than ""why."" Before reading this book, I hadn't considered that physics as a science is a bit of a test of experimentation. On one hand, we learn new rules by experimenting and assume they are true until something goes horribly wrong. On the other one, however, we just exist in a state of chaos - never truly knowing about why rules are the way they are. Talk about frustrating.I admit that in reading this book, I was frustrated. I wanted to know about why certain particles acted in the ways they did and... the answers weren't provided to me. Granted, no scientist has the answer so I shouldn't expect a ""Physics for Dummies"" book to help me. Still. It's a fascinating read, and it's not particularly easy. But give it a whirl, and you will be proud of yourself. Rating: 4/5 Stars"
382,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66906861-megawhoppingcosmicbookwyrm,4,"Quite the introduction to Physics! The only reason it doesn’t get five stars is due to my own limitations of absorbing the material put forth. Feynman is a fantastic educator and communicator, and even my poor excuse for a brain was able to glean a much better understanding of the subject.I didn’t do well with Science in school. Looking back, I can honestly say it was an equal mix of my not trying hard enough, and my writing off scientists as ‘evil people against my religion’; a detrimental state of mind inherited from my family. I’ve never studied Physics at all, and still enjoyed this book immensely.I would suggest only reading this if you truly have a longing to understand the universe more. It’s not something to pick up as a ‘light, entertaining read’ for a vacation or airplane ride... And be prepared for SO many equations.I’ll admit, I’m definitely a Feynman fangirl now. I never paid nearly as much attention to any other science than Biology, and I’m glad I’ve found more areas of interest to expand my horizons. I have Mr. Feynman to thank for that. His words have lit up a passion in me similar to how I felt when I read Darwin and Dawkins. I’m not a scientist, a teacher, or particularly clever by any means, but having people who are all of those things; and that are able to explain mind-boggling things to me so succinctly; is a truly marvelous feat. I am forever grateful to the great minds of this world."

Feynman is a brilliant teacher and, he’s arguably one of the smartest scientists in the 19th century next to Prof. Hawking and Einstein. People also believe that Feynman would have discovered “The General Relativity Theory” if Einstein had not done so. I’ve watched some of his lectures & interviews online and i was very impressed, which is why i’ve decided to invest my money & time in buying and reading one of his books. I have to be honest and say that the book is not as easy to understand as one might think. It is not for those that have no physics background at all. I had difficulties when Feynman talked about basic physics and chemistry facts, it was too dry & somehow really complicated. It was not easy to follow up and to understand the content. But, maybe, i lack the minimum knowledge one must have in order to start listening to a great scientist like Feynman in the first place, that is a very good argument indeed. On the contrary, there’re beautiful examples in this book. His ways of explaining complex subjects with simple examples is phenomenal. - Moe xx..."

I was completely lost at some point after the atomic deep dive though, but for good reason according to Feynman, for “Things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale.” and we have to use our imagination when it comes to the quantum. I’m more interested to see how physics can be stretched to philosophy like the incessant movement of atoms and how our body is continually changing even if there are no outward manifestations.I added this book to my reading list after Naval cited it in a podcast I was listening to, walking towards City Super buying a perk me up afternoon drink.***Quotes:What looks like a dead, uninteresting thing — a glass of water with a cover, that has been sitting there for perhaps twenty years — really contains a dynamic and interesting phenomenon which is going on all the time. To our eyes, our crude eyes, nothing is changing, but if we could see it a billion times magnified, we would see that from its own point of view it is always changing: molecules are leaving the surface, molecules are coming back.“Why does a frog jump?” and the physicist cannot answer."

Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces speaks about six basic topics involved in Physics in a good, enjoyable and yes in a basic yet comprehensive way. The first chapter describes atoms in detailed, their functionality. The second and the third chapter describe physics and its relation to other sciences, good stuff. To be honest, I think the fourth (Conservation of Energy), fifth (The Theory of Gravitation) and sixth (Quantum Behavior - undoubtedly the heart of the book) were the best chapters in the book. I will not go into details as I don't want my review to be a complete spoiler.Just about the last chapter - It speaks and describes ""The Double Slit"" experiment beautifully like I have never understood it before, very detailed. This one chapter is undoubtedly the gem of the book.I'd definitely recommend this book to starters in Physics as well as to the experienced people in Physics (though you'd have known most of it - you can enjoy Feynman's deep insights).I am looking forward to getting hold of Six not-so Easy Pieces but not anytime soon..."

Accessible does not mean easy, and the book finds a delicate balance to discuss the complex topics+ Very well written or lectured. This was an enjoyable read start to finish as I enjoy Feynman's unique way of explaining things. + Honest and sincere. Where we haven't explored theory enough Feynman will quickly conclude ""we don't know"" and ""we must then find out""Cons- Definitely have to be interested in the topic (duh) but this isn't a book to take a risk on. If physics and the way our universe works is not interesting to you, you will get lost in this book and be unable to follow along- the first half of the book is the real ""easy"" bit and therefore it's critical to consider what easy really means. In this context, easy for students of physics at university level. - very minor gripe, but the formatting of the book.

If you're expecting the jovial, self-aggrandizing Feynman of ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character, you're not going to get him here. This is Professor Feynman cleaned up for the classroom, and cleaned up further for mass ""respectable"" publication.The most illuminating part of this book was by far the quantum mechanics chapter, followed by the very basic chapters on basic molecular structure and physical states. Weirdly, the most obtuse chapters for me were on basic principles of force and energy. The diagrams did nothing for me there. I think a static medium of printed words and diagrams is maybe not the best for that subject."

I had had it recommended to me via a Youtube video by Simon Clark. Anyway, I read it while on vacation and it was really, really good. It presents physics in a way that makes it easy to understand without hiding the details. I must admit that some parts were a little hard to understand and concepts were harder to grasp at some parts of the book. I think this is mainly due to my then younger age and the fact that I am a non-native speaker. I do still recommend it to everyone though. The book is perfect for anyone who thinks that they might enjoy physics and wants a first glance over the concepts. It introduces the concepts of basic principles such as conservation of energy all the way to more modern, advanced concepts such as quantum physics (although briefly and graspable). This book has been really important to me. I've only read it once, but the thought concepts presented in that book has been with me ever since I read it and helped me a lot in school to understand new concepts."
389,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67149971-elizabeth-saunders,3,"	In reading the book, ""Six Easy Pieces"" by Richard Feynman, there was one primary thing that I noticed. I consider myself to be a little bit more of a history or math oriented person, and I am even more confident about that now after reading the book. Not to say that the book didn't do a good job of simplifying some of Feynman's key points in physics- I believe it does just that. I understand that I am not part of the ""target audience"" from the book, which is why I feel like I didn't retain a whole lot of the more complicated parts. 	The lectures were definitely geared for the top tier science students. Also, at times, I found it a tad difficult to maintain a consistent level of interest through the passages with more data-heavy detail, as you might expect from a science lecture book. As a whole, though, I would say the book was very informative and an interesting read throughout.

403,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6470362-jean-tessier,5,"I while back, I bought a book that introduced math topics to the lay person. This looked like it could do the same for physics. And by none other than Richard Feynman himself.Feynman goes for a more intuitive approach and avoids any complex mathematics. His explanations and examples are strikingly clear. The jiggling of atoms explain the difference between solid, liquid, and gaseous states. Changing arrangements explain chemical reactions, like burning carbon. Everything is made out of atoms, with patterns that defy the imagination.I struggled through the chapter on the conservation of energy. One take-away is that we can explain limits in nature using reversible machines, even though there are no reversible machines in nature. The chapters on gravitation and quantum mechanics were exceedingly clear. The chapter on how physics relates to the other sciences was a lot of fun. So, too, the chapter on gravitation.Tycho Brahe had an idea that was different from anything proposed by the ancients [...] that to find something out, it is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophical arguments. (p. 90) Tycho Brahe took measurements, Kepler deduced laws from these measurements, Galileo figured out inertia, and Newton formulated the law of gravitation (which was later refined by Einstein).I really like how Feynman repeatedly states the limits of science. There are many things that we simply do not know. For now. There may be things we will never know, but many phenomena in the past were deemed inexplicable, only to be explained later.It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. (p. 71) the principle of inertia — if something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.) (p. 93) All we have done is to describe how the earth moves around the sun, but we have not said what makes it go. (p. 107) No one has since given any machinery. (p. 107) Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. (p. 116) Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. (p. 117) According to Feynman, the fact that there are things we do not know does not mean that we are ignorant. We can explain the limits of how things operate with great precision, even though we cannot explain why.About the conservation of energy:There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law -- it is exact so far as we know. (p. 69) As I was reading the book, I often found myself wondering how much progress we've made since it had been written. For instance, in last year's Outgrowing God, Richard Dawkins makes a case for complex chemistry inevitably leads to self-replicating molecules like RNA and DNA, and eventually living organisms.Feynman does not reduce everything to physics. He acknowledges that there are areas of human knowledge outside of science.If something is said not to be a science, it does not mean that there something wrong with it; it just means that it is not a science. (p. 47) "

I'm not a fan of the paper and the typeface size, and well to me, it takes away from the smooth flow of the much bigger pages of the original book.It just gives me a claustrophobic feeling.---I need those lectures with the pages extra three inches wider, and four inches taller!!---I was given the whole set, since i had trouble trying to find the original red hardcovers in good shape [they always seemed to be warped], and I found them somewhat rough going when I faced Heisenberg's Uncertainity Principle for the first time, I took a break... I took a break and tried again a while later....He was talking about calculating the orbit of one planet and I struggled in places.Anyways, i decided to take a break for a month or two, and i did exactly what Issac Newton did, i decided to reread things all over again, right from the beginning.I simply burned through the first 100-150 pages of the Feynman Lectures and enjoyed it.But i had two small moments where I realized i was rushing things, and decided, later... later...I couldn't have as much fun browsing Vol II because of the calculus, even though i had the math knowledge at the time, but not the introductory calculus-level university level EM, so browsing those early on, i realized i would face some struggles.[I actually spoke to someone once who went to Caltech in the 60s, and he said that he thought Feynman's Lectures were brutal. He couldn't remember his other textbooks, but i really appreciated his insight 20 years later]It really bums me out since Feynman's writing really is beautiful and deep, and i see a lot of slightly unhappy folks picking up this book and having a hard time with it.I totally sympathize, because i felt let down that my concentration didn't flow with the page as easily, as I thought it might with a neat little hardcover.All I can say is that lots of people who experienced the Lectures in the day, some people were frustrated, and some people were blown away, and some experienced both.----All i can say is that reread the book very slowly and patiently, or borrow a copy of Volume One of the full lectures at the library and browse through them, an read the first 30 pages.and please please please READ, Feynman's autobiography firstSurely You're Joking Mister Feynman [Part I]What Do You Care What Other People Think?

405,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"I read this for all the wrong reasons. It was short and I wanted one more book for the month, and I knew I could blitz through all the basic science blah. I blitzed, it wasn't basic, I learned nothing except that I was insufferable and needed to stop this obnoxious book-counting. Also, Feynman was inappropriate and a irrascible, didn't knew. The writing is easy, likeable, and clear, I really wish I'd been able to sit in on one of his lectures, those must have been incredible. But I guess I had the next best thing, Bharatidasan kicking me out for the 10th time in a week because I wasn't adequately spellbound by his reading out from the illustrated guide to the simplified extract of Indian transliteration to the official university textbook of Electrical Machines I, complete with bad grammar, formula errors, and all the sweet smelling dryness of cow-dung prepared for fuel, which is apt because those books were some of the few that deserved to be taken to 451 fahrenheit. Clippingsphilosophically we are completely wrong with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws. Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas.From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics. This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric field and charges,The masses given here are the masses of the particles at rest. The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot be at rest.it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth.When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is deflected."
406,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45200517-simon-zou,4,"This is book is great. I started to read it on the recommendation of a professor in Computer Science and because I wanted to ""like"" physics more, as opposed to thinking it's this hard, scary thing. To that end, it's worked, I like physics more than when I started. On the ""Easy"" in the title: The premise of the book is that, of Feyman's lectures on physics, these are the 6 easiest, digestable for a layman with little to no background in the sciences. So I listened to the first couple chapters as an audiobook. The audiobook uses the recordings from the real lectures and are awesome. The written version drops some of his character and jokes in exchange for clarity so it's nice to get both. Feynman waxes poetry about rocks and moons and atoms and how physics relates to other sciences and it's pretty marvelous. However, once at chapter 4, on the conservation of energy, just listening becomes untenable. There are diagrams and equations and concepts that required my full attention to grasp. I switched from listening to reading, to listening and reading at the same time, to asking myself ""at this point why don't I just watch the lectures on YouTube?"". I did that, and all was good. The explanation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics in particular would be pretty hard to get without looking at the diagrams but with them it makes sense, or rather, explains the consistent way in which quantum doesn't make sense. One thing I noticed from perusing all these mediums is that Amazon keeps track of ""popular"" highlights in books and shows them to you. These were far more prevalent in the first three chapters. I wish they made available (but understand why they don't) other stats because I would guess that chapter 4 is where people might have given up on the book. The title says these pieces are ""easy"", but the last few chapters require your full attention and some quantitative reasoning skills to grasp. It's not so easy that I could fully digest the ideas half paying attention while doing the dishes, as was closer to the case with the earlier chapters. Feynman also uses imaginary ""reversible"" machines to explain energy concepts and I'm still not sure I like that or really get what those are about."
407,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97017413-john,3,"This is quite difficult to review. I knew of Feynman (obviously) but hadn't read or seen his famous early 60s lectures before. This book exists as an introduction to the man and his teaching methods but I'm not convinced it does a particularly good job.Definitely don't read this if you want to learn anything about physics, some of the material is very dated (a lot has happened in the world of physics in the last 56 years). Some of it is still relevant but if you didn't know what how would you pick this out from the irrelevant? The blurb on the book says ""the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics"" and I would strongly dispute that.The book gets off to a decent start, the prefaces and introduction set the scene, they tell us that the lecture series wasn't actually that successful with only a few students present targetted by the material so it's hardly surprising only a few stuck with them. Lecture One (Atoms in Motion) is good, a nice introduction to Feynman's method and the subject matter is gentle and well described. But Lecture Two (Basic Physics) is a disaster IMHO, it's a complete mess with Feynman jumping all over the place and not really explaining anything properly and leaving the reader totally confused. Lecture Three (Relationship of Physics to Other Sciences) is very biology biased and spends a lot of time on enzymes. Other sciences are briefly mentioned or pretty much dismissed, geology and meteorology get very short shrift and only go to emphasise how dated the material is. Lecture Four (Conservation of Energy) is better and thank goodness for Lecture Five (Gravitation) and Lecture Six (Quantum Behaviour) which save this book as they are easily the best two and the best advertisement for Feynman. These last two lectures have the most interesting content and we can see how Feynman excels in explaining these difficult concepts.Overall the book hasn't inspired me to tackle more of Feynman's lectures although the final two lectures came close. There are better and more up to date explanations of many of the concepts tackled in this book. I think it's worth reading, it's a very short and quick read, but don't go in to it expecting to learn much physics."
408,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18566696-nitin-dangwal,4,"Richard Feynman was on my to-read list for a long time. I have heard a lot about his teaching methods. His crystal-clear thought that made him teach the most difficult subjects in the most easiest of methods. Given this, I had a lot of expectations from this book. And I was not disappointed.The book is a primer to anyone who wants to brush up their understanding of the basics in Physics. But unlike the books that we have studied, this book is not a bland narration of the concepts. Rather in your hand, this book is alive, with one of the best teachers of the physics speaking to you. Not one page of this short book is boring. And like a thriller, you turn page by page, trying to know what happens next. Almost every chapter of this gem of a book is amazing. But if asked my favorite, it has to be the chapter on Quantum Physics, and the explanation of dual nature of matter and the inherent uncertainty of the quantum world. I find Quantum Physics for one simple reason. It has confounded both physics and religious alike. So weird is the world of quantum that it makes sense to neither of them. For physicists Quantum Physics provide observation that throw everything they have learnt and beliefs down to gutter. For religious person, the quanta world is nothing short than work of devil, where the world has no order - something that they attribute to the god. And what can they so, so astonishingly is the world of quantum. Particles behave likes waves. But when you take a light source to see what is happening, they start behaving like particles again. Nothing is 'is' there. It is always they could be 60% here, and 40% there. Nothing is certain. Everything is probabilistic. Quantum world apart, I love the book majorly for one reason. It sews everything from the concept of heat to the concept of planetary motion in one single narrative. I think this is the major thing that the science education lacks in today's world. So much we have divided physics from chemistry that we don't realize they are the part of one whole story. This book fills this gap. Must read for a light and entertaining read about basic physics"
409,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89960099-john-doe,4,"Yes, it's very much an introduction. Mainly provide a ""big picture"" which chronologically connected scattered topics of modern physics, and most contents are basically high school physics stuff.But still, it's nice to intuitively connecting the dots in your mind. It's a quick read for me 😁 since I was kinda boost on physics in high school period, literally top grades in physics, favorite part was electric circuits design.If it wasn't for something random I would be the kid who loves physics and studied physics all the way up to uni, gradschool, and PhD maybe. Nevertheless I was a kid came across book with words like nuclear physics at age 5. Anyway, reading felt like a breeze after so many years literally disconnected with any physics stuff. Why I picked up physics again, because I need to understand quantum mechanics, and need to understand higher level mathematics in a physics way not merely arithmetics way. There was a lack of visual intuition in advanced pure mathematics area, I think catching up with the area of physics may be the key to develop intuitions.Another interesting point, why Mr.Feynman had a subtle distaste for philosophy?I think Mr.Feynman simply adopted the uncomformist attitude for both personal life and academic breakthrough, and most of the times the reasonings of the majority of philosophers were kind of absolute, which is the very core against what science at the age often adopted, uncertainty or statistical or probabilistic thinking, in other words, everything is by chance not that absolute as philosophers usually argued. However I think that's not a very fair judgement for philosophy the subject in general, nevertheless, the founding father of probability theory Pascal was himself a great philosopher, had profound work not just about mathematics but about thoughts for life in general. Besides, the very thought or intuition of every mathematics breakthrough IS philosophical. Therefore you can not be both anti philosophy and chasing revolutionary breakthrough in whatever area, instead you have to be kinda of philosophical."
410,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110560654-samen-yasar,5,"In the early 60s at Caltech, student interest in physics started declining sharply among undergraduates. Years of rigorous training in the basics meant undergraduates largely weren't able to engage directly with the most recent advancements in the field. To restore motivation in students, the faculty asked Feynman, already quite famous by then, to teach a course on introductory physics to the freshman and sophomore classes. The result was a wonderful series of lectures that was later transcribed and became what is known today as ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". This book contains only six of the easiest and most accessible pieces from that collection.The lectures are true to the intent. Unlike a typical physics lecture, where complex math and sophisticated jargon reigns supreme, Feynman's discussions have the bare minimum of scientific jargon and almost no math. He gets to the essence of complex concepts with just simple thought experiments and intuitive diagrams. It feels almost as if he is telling a story, when in fact he is explaining a rather complicated concept. Though he primarily focuses on basic concepts, he doesn't shy away from connecting them to more advanced concepts whenever he can. Since it was set in the 60s, some parts of the text pertaining to modern physics is a bit outdated. But those aside the text is truly remarkable.If there is any text on physics at all that I would gladly recommend to any fellow non-physicist, it has to be this series of lectures. The text's usage of simple language and the deliberate omission of math lends itself to a very wide audience. Anyone with basic high school level math and science background should be able to follow through easily."
411,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1848040-gabriella-gricius,4,"Why Read: I love physics. I honestly really truly adore learning about physics. The small caveat is that I'm absolutely horrid at it. Learning about how the universe works (not really why, as Feynman points out) is something that I am not particularly gifted in. But nonetheless, I love reading about it. Review: I picked up Six Easy Pieces an age ago. I thought that it would be a great book for me because as previously mentioned, I'm not good at the subject. The basics are most definitely something that I could use a hand in. Everyone has heard of Feynman's lectures, they're practically famous and so reading the first six ""easy"" pieces felt like something doable.Let me disabuse you of that notion. Much as I enjoyed reading this book, I didn't find it doable or easy to comprehend. The first couple chapters are okay, when you learn about gravity and about the magnetic pulls between atoms and planets - but then... then comes the quantum mechanics. Then comes the simple act that physic researchers are just trying to figure out ""how"" things work, rather than ""why."" Before reading this book, I hadn't considered that physics as a science is a bit of a test of experimentation. On one hand, we learn new rules by experimenting and assume they are true until something goes horribly wrong. On the other one, however, we just exist in a state of chaos - never truly knowing about why rules are the way they are. Talk about frustrating.I admit that in reading this book, I was frustrated. I wanted to know about why certain particles acted in the ways they did and... the answers weren't provided to me. Granted, no scientist has the answer so I shouldn't expect a ""Physics for Dummies"" book to help me. Still. It's a fascinating read, and it's not particularly easy. But give it a whirl, and you will be proud of yourself. Rating: 4/5 Stars"

The only reason it doesn’t get five stars is due to my own limitations of absorbing the material put forth. Feynman is a fantastic educator and communicator, and even my poor excuse for a brain was able to glean a much better understanding of the subject.I didn’t do well with Science in school. Looking back, I can honestly say it was an equal mix of my not trying hard enough, and my writing off scientists as ‘evil people against my religion’; a detrimental state of mind inherited from my family. I’ve never studied Physics at all, and still enjoyed this book immensely.I would suggest only reading this if you truly have a longing to understand the universe more. It’s not something to pick up as a ‘light, entertaining read’ for a vacation or airplane ride... And be prepared for SO many equations.I’ll admit, I’m definitely a Feynman fangirl now. I never paid nearly as much attention to any other science than Biology, and I’m glad I’ve found more areas of interest to expand my horizons. I have Mr. Feynman to thank for that. His words have lit up a passion in me similar to how I felt when I read Darwin and Dawkins. I’m not a scientist, a teacher, or particularly clever by any means, but having people who are all of those things; and that are able to explain mind-boggling things to me so succinctly; is a truly marvelous feat. I am forever grateful to the great minds of this world."

Feynman is a brilliant teacher and, he’s arguably one of the smartest scientists in the 19th century next to Prof. Hawking and Einstein. People also believe that Feynman would have discovered “The General Relativity Theory” if Einstein had not done so. I’ve watched some of his lectures & interviews online and i was very impressed, which is why i’ve decided to invest my money & time in buying and reading one of his books. I have to be honest and say that the book is not as easy to understand as one might think. It is not for those that have no physics background at all. I had difficulties when Feynman talked about basic physics and chemistry facts, it was too dry & somehow really complicated. It was not easy to follow up and to understand the content. But, maybe, i lack the minimum knowledge one must have in order to start listening to a great scientist like Feynman in the first place, that is a very good argument indeed. On the contrary, there’re beautiful examples in this book. His ways of explaining complex subjects with simple examples is phenomenal. - Moe xx..."

I was completely lost at some point after the atomic deep dive though, but for good reason according to Feynman, for “Things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale.” and we have to use our imagination when it comes to the quantum. I’m more interested to see how physics can be stretched to philosophy like the incessant movement of atoms and how our body is continually changing even if there are no outward manifestations.I added this book to my reading list after Naval cited it in a podcast I was listening to, walking towards City Super buying a perk me up afternoon drink.***Quotes:What looks like a dead, uninteresting thing — a glass of water with a cover, that has been sitting there for perhaps twenty years — really contains a dynamic and interesting phenomenon which is going on all the time. To our eyes, our crude eyes, nothing is changing, but if we could see it a billion times magnified, we would see that from its own point of view it is always changing: molecules are leaving the surface, molecules are coming back.“Why does a frog jump?” and the physicist cannot answer."

Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces speaks about six basic topics involved in Physics in a good, enjoyable and yes in a basic yet comprehensive way. The first chapter describes atoms in detailed, their functionality. The second and the third chapter describe physics and its relation to other sciences, good stuff. To be honest, I think the fourth (Conservation of Energy), fifth (The Theory of Gravitation) and sixth (Quantum Behavior - undoubtedly the heart of the book) were the best chapters in the book. I will not go into details as I don't want my review to be a complete spoiler.Just about the last chapter - It speaks and describes ""The Double Slit"" experiment beautifully like I have never understood it before, very detailed. This one chapter is undoubtedly the gem of the book.I'd definitely recommend this book to starters in Physics as well as to the experienced people in Physics (though you'd have known most of it - you can enjoy Feynman's deep insights).I am looking forward to getting hold of Six not-so Easy Pieces but not anytime soon..."

Accessible does not mean easy, and the book finds a delicate balance to discuss the complex topics+ Very well written or lectured. This was an enjoyable read start to finish as I enjoy Feynman's unique way of explaining things. + Honest and sincere. Where we haven't explored theory enough Feynman will quickly conclude ""we don't know"" and ""we must then find out""Cons- Definitely have to be interested in the topic (duh) but this isn't a book to take a risk on. If physics and the way our universe works is not interesting to you, you will get lost in this book and be unable to follow along- the first half of the book is the real ""easy"" bit and therefore it's critical to consider what easy really means. In this context, easy for students of physics at university level. - very minor gripe, but the formatting of the book.

If you're expecting the jovial, self-aggrandizing Feynman of ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character, you're not going to get him here. This is Professor Feynman cleaned up for the classroom, and cleaned up further for mass ""respectable"" publication.The most illuminating part of this book was by far the quantum mechanics chapter, followed by the very basic chapters on basic molecular structure and physical states. Weirdly, the most obtuse chapters for me were on basic principles of force and energy. The diagrams did nothing for me there.

I had had it recommended to me via a Youtube video by Simon Clark. Anyway, I read it while on vacation and it was really, really good. It presents physics in a way that makes it easy to understand without hiding the details. I must admit that some parts were a little hard to understand and concepts were harder to grasp at some parts of the book. I think this is mainly due to my then younger age and the fact that I am a non-native speaker. I do still recommend it to everyone though. The book is perfect for anyone who thinks that they might enjoy physics and wants a first glance over the concepts. It introduces the concepts of basic principles such as conservation of energy all the way to more modern, advanced concepts such as quantum physics (although briefly and graspable). This book has been really important to me. I've only read it once, but the thought concepts presented in that book has been with me ever since I read it and helped me a lot in school to understand new concepts."

I consider myself to be a little bit more of a history or math oriented person, and I am even more confident about that now after reading the book. Not to say that the book didn't do a good job of simplifying some of Feynman's key points in physics- I believe it does just that. I understand that I am not part of the ""target audience"" from the book, which is why I feel like I didn't retain a whole lot of the more complicated parts. 	The lectures were definitely geared for the top tier science students. Also, at times, I found it a tad difficult to maintain a consistent level of interest through the passages with more data-heavy detail, as you might expect from a science lecture book. As a whole, though, I would say the book was very informative and an interesting read throughout.

433,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6470362-jean-tessier,5,"I while back, I bought a book that introduced math topics to the lay person. This looked like it could do the same for physics. And by none other than Richard Feynman himself.Feynman goes for a more intuitive approach and avoids any complex mathematics. His explanations and examples are strikingly clear. The jiggling of atoms explain the difference between solid, liquid, and gaseous states. Changing arrangements explain chemical reactions, like burning carbon. Everything is made out of atoms, with patterns that defy the imagination.I struggled through the chapter on the conservation of energy. One take-away is that we can explain limits in nature using reversible machines, even though there are no reversible machines in nature. The chapters on gravitation and quantum mechanics were exceedingly clear. The chapter on how physics relates to the other sciences was a lot of fun. So, too, the chapter on gravitation.Tycho Brahe had an idea that was different from anything proposed by the ancients [...] that to find something out, it is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophical arguments. (p. 90) Tycho Brahe took measurements, Kepler deduced laws from these measurements, Galileo figured out inertia, and Newton formulated the law of gravitation (which was later refined by Einstein).I really like how Feynman repeatedly states the limits of science. There are many things that we simply do not know. For now. There may be things we will never know, but many phenomena in the past were deemed inexplicable, only to be explained later.It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. (p. 71) the principle of inertia — if something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.) (p. 93) All we have done is to describe how the earth moves around the sun, but we have not said what makes it go. (p. 107) No one has since given any machinery. (p. 107) Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. (p. 116) Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. (p. 117) According to Feynman, the fact that there are things we do not know does not mean that we are ignorant. We can explain the limits of how things operate with great precision, even though we cannot explain why.About the conservation of energy:There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law -- it is exact so far as we know. (p. 69) As I was reading the book, I often found myself wondering how much progress we've made since it had been written. For instance, in last year's Outgrowing God, Richard Dawkins makes a case for complex chemistry inevitably leads to self-replicating molecules like RNA and DNA, and eventually living organisms.Feynman does not reduce everything to physics. He acknowledges that there are areas of human knowledge outside of science.If something is said not to be a science, it does not mean that there something wrong with it; it just means that it is not a science. (p. 47) "

I'm not a fan of the paper and the typeface size, and well to me, it takes away from the smooth flow of the much bigger pages of the original book.It just gives me a claustrophobic feeling.---I need those lectures with the pages extra three inches wider, and four inches taller!!---I was given the whole set, since i had trouble trying to find the original red hardcovers in good shape [they always seemed to be warped], and I found them somewhat rough going when I faced Heisenberg's Uncertainity Principle for the first time, I took a break... I took a break and tried again a while later....He was talking about calculating the orbit of one planet and I struggled in places.Anyways, i decided to take a break for a month or two, and i did exactly what Issac Newton did, i decided to reread things all over again, right from the beginning.I simply burned through the first 100-150 pages of the Feynman Lectures and enjoyed it.But i had two small moments where I realized i was rushing things, and decided, later... later...I couldn't have as much fun browsing Vol II because of the calculus, even though i had the math knowledge at the time, but not the introductory calculus-level university level EM, so browsing those early on, i realized i would face some struggles.[I actually spoke to someone once who went to Caltech in the 60s, and he said that he thought Feynman's Lectures were brutal. He couldn't remember his other textbooks, but i really appreciated his insight 20 years later]It really bums me out since Feynman's writing really is beautiful and deep, and i see a lot of slightly unhappy folks picking up this book and having a hard time with it.I totally sympathize, because i felt let down that my concentration didn't flow with the page as easily, as I thought it might with a neat little hardcover.All I can say is that lots of people who experienced the Lectures in the day, some people were frustrated, and some people were blown away, and some experienced both.----All i can say is that reread the book very slowly and patiently, or borrow a copy of Volume One of the full lectures at the library and browse through them, an read the first 30 pages.and please please please READ, Feynman's autobiography firstSurely You're Joking Mister Feynman [Part I]What Do You Care What Other People Think?

435,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"I read this for all the wrong reasons. It was short and I wanted one more book for the month, and I knew I could blitz through all the basic science blah. I blitzed, it wasn't basic, I learned nothing except that I was insufferable and needed to stop this obnoxious book-counting. Also, Feynman was inappropriate and a irrascible, didn't knew. The writing is easy, likeable, and clear, I really wish I'd been able to sit in on one of his lectures, those must have been incredible. But I guess I had the next best thing, Bharatidasan kicking me out for the 10th time in a week because I wasn't adequately spellbound by his reading out from the illustrated guide to the simplified extract of Indian transliteration to the official university textbook of Electrical Machines I, complete with bad grammar, formula errors, and all the sweet smelling dryness of cow-dung prepared for fuel, which is apt because those books were some of the few that deserved to be taken to 451 fahrenheit. Clippingsphilosophically we are completely wrong with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws. Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas.From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics. This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric field and charges,The masses given here are the masses of the particles at rest. The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot be at rest.it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth.When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is deflected."
436,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45200517-simon-zou,4,"This is book is great. I started to read it on the recommendation of a professor in Computer Science and because I wanted to ""like"" physics more, as opposed to thinking it's this hard, scary thing. To that end, it's worked, I like physics more than when I started. On the ""Easy"" in the title: The premise of the book is that, of Feyman's lectures on physics, these are the 6 easiest, digestable for a layman with little to no background in the sciences. So I listened to the first couple chapters as an audiobook. The audiobook uses the recordings from the real lectures and are awesome. The written version drops some of his character and jokes in exchange for clarity so it's nice to get both. Feynman waxes poetry about rocks and moons and atoms and how physics relates to other sciences and it's pretty marvelous. However, once at chapter 4, on the conservation of energy, just listening becomes untenable. There are diagrams and equations and concepts that required my full attention to grasp. I switched from listening to reading, to listening and reading at the same time, to asking myself ""at this point why don't I just watch the lectures on YouTube?"". I did that, and all was good. The explanation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics in particular would be pretty hard to get without looking at the diagrams but with them it makes sense, or rather, explains the consistent way in which quantum doesn't make sense. One thing I noticed from perusing all these mediums is that Amazon keeps track of ""popular"" highlights in books and shows them to you. These were far more prevalent in the first three chapters. I wish they made available (but understand why they don't) other stats because I would guess that chapter 4 is where people might have given up on the book. The title says these pieces are ""easy"", but the last few chapters require your full attention and some quantitative reasoning skills to grasp. It's not so easy that I could fully digest the ideas half paying attention while doing the dishes, as was closer to the case with the earlier chapters. Feynman also uses imaginary ""reversible"" machines to explain energy concepts and I'm still not sure I like that or really get what those are about."
437,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97017413-john,3,"This is quite difficult to review. I knew of Feynman (obviously) but hadn't read or seen his famous early 60s lectures before. This book exists as an introduction to the man and his teaching methods but I'm not convinced it does a particularly good job.Definitely don't read this if you want to learn anything about physics, some of the material is very dated (a lot has happened in the world of physics in the last 56 years). Some of it is still relevant but if you didn't know what how would you pick this out from the irrelevant? The blurb on the book says ""the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics"" and I would strongly dispute that.The book gets off to a decent start, the prefaces and introduction set the scene, they tell us that the lecture series wasn't actually that successful with only a few students present targetted by the material so it's hardly surprising only a few stuck with them. Lecture One (Atoms in Motion) is good, a nice introduction to Feynman's method and the subject matter is gentle and well described. But Lecture Two (Basic Physics) is a disaster IMHO, it's a complete mess with Feynman jumping all over the place and not really explaining anything properly and leaving the reader totally confused. Lecture Three (Relationship of Physics to Other Sciences) is very biology biased and spends a lot of time on enzymes. Other sciences are briefly mentioned or pretty much dismissed, geology and meteorology get very short shrift and only go to emphasise how dated the material is. Lecture Four (Conservation of Energy) is better and thank goodness for Lecture Five (Gravitation) and Lecture Six (Quantum Behaviour) which save this book as they are easily the best two and the best advertisement for Feynman. These last two lectures have the most interesting content and we can see how Feynman excels in explaining these difficult concepts.Overall the book hasn't inspired me to tackle more of Feynman's lectures although the final two lectures came close. There are better and more up to date explanations of many of the concepts tackled in this book. I think it's worth reading, it's a very short and quick read, but don't go in to it expecting to learn much physics."
438,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18566696-nitin-dangwal,4,"Richard Feynman was on my to-read list for a long time. I have heard a lot about his teaching methods. His crystal-clear thought that made him teach the most difficult subjects in the most easiest of methods. Given this, I had a lot of expectations from this book. And I was not disappointed.The book is a primer to anyone who wants to brush up their understanding of the basics in Physics. But unlike the books that we have studied, this book is not a bland narration of the concepts. Rather in your hand, this book is alive, with one of the best teachers of the physics speaking to you. Not one page of this short book is boring. And like a thriller, you turn page by page, trying to know what happens next. Almost every chapter of this gem of a book is amazing. But if asked my favorite, it has to be the chapter on Quantum Physics, and the explanation of dual nature of matter and the inherent uncertainty of the quantum world. I find Quantum Physics for one simple reason. It has confounded both physics and religious alike. So weird is the world of quantum that it makes sense to neither of them. For physicists Quantum Physics provide observation that throw everything they have learnt and beliefs down to gutter. For religious person, the quanta world is nothing short than work of devil, where the world has no order - something that they attribute to the god. And what can they so, so astonishingly is the world of quantum. Particles behave likes waves. But when you take a light source to see what is happening, they start behaving like particles again. Nothing is 'is' there. It is always they could be 60% here, and 40% there. Nothing is certain. Everything is probabilistic. Quantum world apart, I love the book majorly for one reason. It sews everything from the concept of heat to the concept of planetary motion in one single narrative. I think this is the major thing that the science education lacks in today's world. So much we have divided physics from chemistry that we don't realize they are the part of one whole story. This book fills this gap. Must read for a light and entertaining read about basic physics"
439,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89960099-john-doe,4,"Yes, it's very much an introduction. Mainly provide a ""big picture"" which chronologically connected scattered topics of modern physics, and most contents are basically high school physics stuff.But still, it's nice to intuitively connecting the dots in your mind. It's a quick read for me 😁 since I was kinda boost on physics in high school period, literally top grades in physics, favorite part was electric circuits design.If it wasn't for something random I would be the kid who loves physics and studied physics all the way up to uni, gradschool, and PhD maybe. Nevertheless I was a kid came across book with words like nuclear physics at age 5. Anyway, reading felt like a breeze after so many years literally disconnected with any physics stuff. Why I picked up physics again, because I need to understand quantum mechanics, and need to understand higher level mathematics in a physics way not merely arithmetics way. There was a lack of visual intuition in advanced pure mathematics area, I think catching up with the area of physics may be the key to develop intuitions.Another interesting point, why Mr.Feynman had a subtle distaste for philosophy?I think Mr.Feynman simply adopted the uncomformist attitude for both personal life and academic breakthrough, and most of the times the reasonings of the majority of philosophers were kind of absolute, which is the very core against what science at the age often adopted, uncertainty or statistical or probabilistic thinking, in other words, everything is by chance not that absolute as philosophers usually argued. However I think that's not a very fair judgement for philosophy the subject in general, nevertheless, the founding father of probability theory Pascal was himself a great philosopher, had profound work not just about mathematics but about thoughts for life in general. Besides, the very thought or intuition of every mathematics breakthrough IS philosophical. Therefore you can not be both anti philosophy and chasing revolutionary breakthrough in whatever area, instead you have to be kinda of philosophical."
440,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110560654-samen-yasar,5,"In the early 60s at Caltech, student interest in physics started declining sharply among undergraduates. Years of rigorous training in the basics meant undergraduates largely weren't able to engage directly with the most recent advancements in the field. To restore motivation in students, the faculty asked Feynman, already quite famous by then, to teach a course on introductory physics to the freshman and sophomore classes. The result was a wonderful series of lectures that was later transcribed and became what is known today as ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". This book contains only six of the easiest and most accessible pieces from that collection.The lectures are true to the intent. Unlike a typical physics lecture, where complex math and sophisticated jargon reigns supreme, Feynman's discussions have the bare minimum of scientific jargon and almost no math. He gets to the essence of complex concepts with just simple thought experiments and intuitive diagrams. It feels almost as if he is telling a story, when in fact he is explaining a rather complicated concept. Though he primarily focuses on basic concepts, he doesn't shy away from connecting them to more advanced concepts whenever he can. Since it was set in the 60s, some parts of the text pertaining to modern physics is a bit outdated. But those aside the text is truly remarkable.If there is any text on physics at all that I would gladly recommend to any fellow non-physicist, it has to be this series of lectures. The text's usage of simple language and the deliberate omission of math lends itself to a very wide audience. Anyone with basic high school level math and science background should be able to follow through easily."

The small caveat is that I'm absolutely horrid at it. Learning about how the universe works (not really why, as Feynman points out) is something that I am not particularly gifted in. But nonetheless, I love reading about it. Review: I picked up Six Easy Pieces an age ago. I thought that it would be a great book for me because as previously mentioned, I'm not good at the subject. The basics are most definitely something that I could use a hand in. Everyone has heard of Feynman's lectures, they're practically famous and so reading the first six ""easy"" pieces felt like something doable.Let me disabuse you of that notion. Much as I enjoyed reading this book, I didn't find it doable or easy to comprehend. The first couple chapters are okay, when you learn about gravity and about the magnetic pulls between atoms and planets - but then... then comes the quantum mechanics. Then comes the simple act that physic researchers are just trying to figure out ""how"" things work, rather than ""why."" Before reading this book, I hadn't considered that physics as a science is a bit of a test of experimentation. On one hand, we learn new rules by experimenting and assume they are true until something goes horribly wrong. On the other one, however, we just exist in a state of chaos - never truly knowing about why rules are the way they are. Talk about frustrating.I admit that in reading this book, I was frustrated. I wanted to know about why certain particles acted in the ways they did and... the answers weren't provided to me. Granted, no scientist has the answer so I shouldn't expect a ""Physics for Dummies"" book to help me. Still. It's a fascinating read, and it's not particularly easy. But give it a whirl, and you will be proud of yourself. Rating: 4/5 Stars"
442,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66906861-megawhoppingcosmicbookwyrm,4,"Quite the introduction to Physics! The only reason it doesn’t get five stars is due to my own limitations of absorbing the material put forth. Feynman is a fantastic educator and communicator, and even my poor excuse for a brain was able to glean a much better understanding of the subject.I didn’t do well with Science in school. Looking back, I can honestly say it was an equal mix of my not trying hard enough, and my writing off scientists as ‘evil people against my religion’; a detrimental state of mind inherited from my family. I’ve never studied Physics at all, and still enjoyed this book immensely.I would suggest only reading this if you truly have a longing to understand the universe more. It’s not something to pick up as a ‘light, entertaining read’ for a vacation or airplane ride... And be prepared for SO many equations.I’ll admit, I’m definitely a Feynman fangirl now. I never paid nearly as much attention to any other science than Biology, and I’m glad I’ve found more areas of interest to expand my horizons. I have Mr. Feynman to thank for that. His words have lit up a passion in me similar to how I felt when I read Darwin and Dawkins. I’m not a scientist, a teacher, or particularly clever by any means, but having people who are all of those things; and that are able to explain mind-boggling things to me so succinctly; is a truly marvelous feat. I am forever grateful to the great minds of this world."

Feynman is a brilliant teacher and, he’s arguably one of the smartest scientists in the 19th century next to Prof. Hawking and Einstein. People also believe that Feynman would have discovered “The General Relativity Theory” if Einstein had not done so. I’ve watched some of his lectures & interviews online and i was very impressed, which is why i’ve decided to invest my money & time in buying and reading one of his books. I have to be honest and say that the book is not as easy to understand as one might think. It is not for those that have no physics background at all. I had difficulties when Feynman talked about basic physics and chemistry facts, it was too dry & somehow really complicated. It was not easy to follow up and to understand the content. But, maybe, i lack the minimum knowledge one must have in order to start listening to a great scientist like Feynman in the first place, that is a very good argument indeed. On the contrary, there’re beautiful examples in this book. His ways of explaining complex subjects with simple examples is phenomenal. - Moe xx..."

I was completely lost at some point after the atomic deep dive though, but for good reason according to Feynman, for “Things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale.” and we have to use our imagination when it comes to the quantum. I’m more interested to see how physics can be stretched to philosophy like the incessant movement of atoms and how our body is continually changing even if there are no outward manifestations.I added this book to my reading list after Naval cited it in a podcast I was listening to, walking towards City Super buying a perk me up afternoon drink.***Quotes:What looks like a dead, uninteresting thing — a glass of water with a cover, that has been sitting there for perhaps twenty years — really contains a dynamic and interesting phenomenon which is going on all the time. To our eyes, our crude eyes, nothing is changing, but if we could see it a billion times magnified, we would see that from its own point of view it is always changing: molecules are leaving the surface, molecules are coming back.“Why does a frog jump?” and the physicist cannot answer."

Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces speaks about six basic topics involved in Physics in a good, enjoyable and yes in a basic yet comprehensive way. The first chapter describes atoms in detailed, their functionality. The second and the third chapter describe physics and its relation to other sciences, good stuff. To be honest, I think the fourth (Conservation of Energy), fifth (The Theory of Gravitation) and sixth (Quantum Behavior - undoubtedly the heart of the book) were the best chapters in the book. I will not go into details as I don't want my review to be a complete spoiler.Just about the last chapter - It speaks and describes ""The Double Slit"" experiment beautifully like I have never understood it before, very detailed. This one chapter is undoubtedly the gem of the book.I'd definitely recommend this book to starters in Physics as well as to the experienced people in Physics (though you'd have known most of it - you can enjoy Feynman's deep insights).I am looking forward to getting hold of Six not-so Easy Pieces but not anytime soon..."

Accessible does not mean easy, and the book finds a delicate balance to discuss the complex topics+ Very well written or lectured. This was an enjoyable read start to finish as I enjoy Feynman's unique way of explaining things. + Honest and sincere. Where we haven't explored theory enough Feynman will quickly conclude ""we don't know"" and ""we must then find out""Cons- Definitely have to be interested in the topic (duh) but this isn't a book to take a risk on. If physics and the way our universe works is not interesting to you, you will get lost in this book and be unable to follow along- the first half of the book is the real ""easy"" bit and therefore it's critical to consider what easy really means. In this context, easy for students of physics at university level. - very minor gripe, but the formatting of the book. Feynman will discuss topics and the related figure or diagram won't be until the next page; frustrating if you're genuinely interested in pursuing this as a learning resource."

If you're expecting the jovial, self-aggrandizing Feynman of ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character, you're not going to get him here. This is Professor Feynman cleaned up for the classroom, and cleaned up further for mass ""respectable"" publication.The most illuminating part of this book was by far the quantum mechanics chapter, followed by the very basic chapters on basic molecular structure and physical states. Weirdly, the most obtuse chapters for me were on basic principles of force and energy. The diagrams did nothing for me there. I think a static medium of printed words and diagrams is maybe not the best for that subject."

I had had it recommended to me via a Youtube video by Simon Clark. Anyway, I read it while on vacation and it was really, really good. It presents physics in a way that makes it easy to understand without hiding the details. I must admit that some parts were a little hard to understand and concepts were harder to grasp at some parts of the book. I think this is mainly due to my then younger age and the fact that I am a non-native speaker. I do still recommend it to everyone though. The book is perfect for anyone who thinks that they might enjoy physics and wants a first glance over the concepts. It introduces the concepts of basic principles such as conservation of energy all the way to more modern, advanced concepts such as quantum physics (although briefly and graspable). This book has been really important to me. I've only read it once, but the thought concepts presented in that book has been with me ever since I read it and helped me a lot in school to understand new concepts."

I consider myself to be a little bit more of a history or math oriented person, and I am even more confident about that now after reading the book. Not to say that the book didn't do a good job of simplifying some of Feynman's key points in physics- I believe it does just that. I understand that I am not part of the ""target audience"" from the book, which is why I feel like I didn't retain a whole lot of the more complicated parts. 	The lectures were definitely geared for the top tier science students. Also, at times, I found it a tad difficult to maintain a consistent level of interest through the passages with more data-heavy detail, as you might expect from a science lecture book. As a whole, though, I would say the book was very informative and an interesting read throughout.

459,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

While the title says ""easy"" - it is keeping in mind that these were lectures for the best and brightest at Caltech...so yes, while they are not overly complex, they are also not designed for the novice either. Five of the lectures cover concepts in classical physics (energy, gravitation etc) and the role of physics in society. However, it is the final chapter on quantum which is the gold mine in this book (especially regarding the Uncertainty Principle).I am a massive Feynman fan and he is widely notes as one of the best (and most engaging) physics teachers of the 20th century and while this book was good and definitely worth picking up, I am not sure whether I would call it great as some of the magic of Feynman just didn't translate as well as I was hoping to the written page. Well worth the read."
462,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46917424-rami,5,"The way that Feynman goes by explaining the topics of this book reminded me of Stephen Hawking's books about the universe. I did enjoy the analogies the author uses to explain some principles that are not always easy to grasp, particularly about our our knowledge of the laws discussed.I found myself discovering new ideas and seeing things from a new perspective even after several years in engineering, having already read and studies most of the content of this book before, but never from this angle.Would definitely recommend it as an entry point to people who want more insight into modern day physics."
463,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094533-mary-overton,0,"Lectures from a series given at Caltech in the early 60s - intended for freshmen, to stimulate their interest in physics. Special Preface: ""Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that's not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered students started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience."" pp. xxii-xxiii""'Quantum mechanics' is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."" pg. 116""Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience."" pg. 117 ""We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics....We can only predict the odds!.... We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."" pg. 135"
464,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30489708-alcatraz-dey,4,"This book is a brilliant way to broaden your knowledge of the key concepts of physics. Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."
465,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"This book is an introduction to the most basic ideas of physics, and part of its sophistication is that it hints at how deep the...rabbit hole...is, without requiring readers to have enough expertise to really go down it.It was readable but challenging for me - someone with a bachelor's in biology and no great adeptitude for physics or math. My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
466,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
467,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."
468,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"Non-fiction. This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."
469,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336491-laura,2,"I may be one of the few scientists who is not a Feynman fan. He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."

A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."
471,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4333246-lauren,5,"Feynman never ceases to amaze me with his genuine ability to take a complicated subject (or concept) and make it accessible to the masses. After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe. If you want a book that will truly keep you on your toes and thinking, pick this one up. "
472,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22224713-john-gribbin,4,"One of the biggest influences on my scientific career, and later my career as a populariser of science, was the multi-volume Feynman Lectures on Physics which appeared in the early 1960s. This epitome of that masterwork really does offer an easy guide to what physics, and science in general, is all about. Feynman explores the most fundamental scientific theories that all intelligent people should be aware of – the structure and behaviour of atoms, quantum mechanics and gravity. These are the fundamentals that ought to be as well known as Shakespeare, Mozart and Picasso. The material is essentially a transcript of Feynman lecturing (you can even get the lectures themselves on a CD to accompany the book), and comes across like a wise friend giving you the inside story on a subject he loves."

In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

The departments for both at my school were fairly challenging and I wasn’t particularly good at them and so I shied away for fear they would hurt my GPA.As it turns out, no one has ever asked to see my GPA and I would have been better off taking the classes, getting Cs and learning a lot. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

493,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6470362-jean-tessier,5,"I while back, I bought a book that introduced math topics to the lay person. This looked like it could do the same for physics. And by none other than Richard Feynman himself.Feynman goes for a more intuitive approach and avoids any complex mathematics. His explanations and examples are strikingly clear. The jiggling of atoms explain the difference between solid, liquid, and gaseous states. Changing arrangements explain chemical reactions, like burning carbon. Everything is made out of atoms, with patterns that defy the imagination.I struggled through the chapter on the conservation of energy. One take-away is that we can explain limits in nature using reversible machines, even though there are no reversible machines in nature. The chapters on gravitation and quantum mechanics were exceedingly clear. The chapter on how physics relates to the other sciences was a lot of fun. So, too, the chapter on gravitation.Tycho Brahe had an idea that was different from anything proposed by the ancients [...] that to find something out, it is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophical arguments. (p. 90) Tycho Brahe took measurements, Kepler deduced laws from these measurements, Galileo figured out inertia, and Newton formulated the law of gravitation (which was later refined by Einstein).I really like how Feynman repeatedly states the limits of science. There are many things that we simply do not know. For now. There may be things we will never know, but many phenomena in the past were deemed inexplicable, only to be explained later.It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. (p. 71) the principle of inertia — if something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.) (p. 93) All we have done is to describe how the earth moves around the sun, but we have not said what makes it go. (p. 107) No one has since given any machinery. (p. 107) Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. (p. 116) Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. (p. 117) According to Feynman, the fact that there are things we do not know does not mean that we are ignorant. We can explain the limits of how things operate with great precision, even though we cannot explain why.About the conservation of energy:There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law -- it is exact so far as we know. (p. 69) As I was reading the book, I often found myself wondering how much progress we've made since it had been written. For instance, in last year's Outgrowing God, Richard Dawkins makes a case for complex chemistry inevitably leads to self-replicating molecules like RNA and DNA, and eventually living organisms.Feynman does not reduce everything to physics. He acknowledges that there are areas of human knowledge outside of science.If something is said not to be a science, it does not mean that there something wrong with it; it just means that it is not a science. (p. 47) "

I'm not a fan of the paper and the typeface size, and well to me, it takes away from the smooth flow of the much bigger pages of the original book.It just gives me a claustrophobic feeling.---I need those lectures with the pages extra three inches wider, and four inches taller!!---I was given the whole set, since i had trouble trying to find the original red hardcovers in good shape [they always seemed to be warped], and I found them somewhat rough going when I faced Heisenberg's Uncertainity Principle for the first time, I took a break... I took a break and tried again a while later....He was talking about calculating the orbit of one planet and I struggled in places.Anyways, i decided to take a break for a month or two, and i did exactly what Issac Newton did, i decided to reread things all over again, right from the beginning.I simply burned through the first 100-150 pages of the Feynman Lectures and enjoyed it.But i had two small moments where I realized i was rushing things, and decided, later... later...I couldn't have as much fun browsing Vol II because of the calculus, even though i had the math knowledge at the time, but not the introductory calculus-level university level EM, so browsing those early on, i realized i would face some struggles.[I actually spoke to someone once who went to Caltech in the 60s, and he said that he thought Feynman's Lectures were brutal. He couldn't remember his other textbooks, but i really appreciated his insight 20 years later]It really bums me out since Feynman's writing really is beautiful and deep, and i see a lot of slightly unhappy folks picking up this book and having a hard time with it.I totally sympathize, because i felt let down that my concentration didn't flow with the page as easily, as I thought it might with a neat little hardcover.All I can say is that lots of people who experienced the Lectures in the day, some people were frustrated, and some people were blown away, and some experienced both.----All i can say is that reread the book very slowly and patiently, or borrow a copy of Volume One of the full lectures at the library and browse through them, an read the first 30 pages.and please please please READ, Feynman's autobiography firstSurely You're Joking Mister Feynman [Part I]What Do You Care What Other People Think? [Part II]"
495,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"I read this for all the wrong reasons. It was short and I wanted one more book for the month, and I knew I could blitz through all the basic science blah. I blitzed, it wasn't basic, I learned nothing except that I was insufferable and needed to stop this obnoxious book-counting. Also, Feynman was inappropriate and a irrascible, didn't knew. The writing is easy, likeable, and clear, I really wish I'd been able to sit in on one of his lectures, those must have been incredible. But I guess I had the next best thing, Bharatidasan kicking me out for the 10th time in a week because I wasn't adequately spellbound by his reading out from the illustrated guide to the simplified extract of Indian transliteration to the official university textbook of Electrical Machines I, complete with bad grammar, formula errors, and all the sweet smelling dryness of cow-dung prepared for fuel, which is apt because those books were some of the few that deserved to be taken to 451 fahrenheit. Clippingsphilosophically we are completely wrong with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws. Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas.From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics. This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric field and charges,The masses given here are the masses of the particles at rest. The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot be at rest.it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth.When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is deflected."
496,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45200517-simon-zou,4,"This is book is great. I started to read it on the recommendation of a professor in Computer Science and because I wanted to ""like"" physics more, as opposed to thinking it's this hard, scary thing. To that end, it's worked, I like physics more than when I started. On the ""Easy"" in the title: The premise of the book is that, of Feyman's lectures on physics, these are the 6 easiest, digestable for a layman with little to no background in the sciences. So I listened to the first couple chapters as an audiobook. The audiobook uses the recordings from the real lectures and are awesome. The written version drops some of his character and jokes in exchange for clarity so it's nice to get both. Feynman waxes poetry about rocks and moons and atoms and how physics relates to other sciences and it's pretty marvelous. However, once at chapter 4, on the conservation of energy, just listening becomes untenable. There are diagrams and equations and concepts that required my full attention to grasp. I switched from listening to reading, to listening and reading at the same time, to asking myself ""at this point why don't I just watch the lectures on YouTube?"". I did that, and all was good. The explanation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics in particular would be pretty hard to get without looking at the diagrams but with them it makes sense, or rather, explains the consistent way in which quantum doesn't make sense. One thing I noticed from perusing all these mediums is that Amazon keeps track of ""popular"" highlights in books and shows them to you. These were far more prevalent in the first three chapters. I wish they made available (but understand why they don't) other stats because I would guess that chapter 4 is where people might have given up on the book. The title says these pieces are ""easy"", but the last few chapters require your full attention and some quantitative reasoning skills to grasp. It's not so easy that I could fully digest the ideas half paying attention while doing the dishes, as was closer to the case with the earlier chapters. Feynman also uses imaginary ""reversible"" machines to explain energy concepts and I'm still not sure I like that or really get what those are about."
497,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97017413-john,3,"This is quite difficult to review. I knew of Feynman (obviously) but hadn't read or seen his famous early 60s lectures before. This book exists as an introduction to the man and his teaching methods but I'm not convinced it does a particularly good job.Definitely don't read this if you want to learn anything about physics, some of the material is very dated (a lot has happened in the world of physics in the last 56 years). Some of it is still relevant but if you didn't know what how would you pick this out from the irrelevant? The blurb on the book says ""the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics"" and I would strongly dispute that.The book gets off to a decent start, the prefaces and introduction set the scene, they tell us that the lecture series wasn't actually that successful with only a few students present targetted by the material so it's hardly surprising only a few stuck with them. Lecture One (Atoms in Motion) is good, a nice introduction to Feynman's method and the subject matter is gentle and well described. But Lecture Two (Basic Physics) is a disaster IMHO, it's a complete mess with Feynman jumping all over the place and not really explaining anything properly and leaving the reader totally confused. Lecture Three (Relationship of Physics to Other Sciences) is very biology biased and spends a lot of time on enzymes. Other sciences are briefly mentioned or pretty much dismissed, geology and meteorology get very short shrift and only go to emphasise how dated the material is. Lecture Four (Conservation of Energy) is better and thank goodness for Lecture Five (Gravitation) and Lecture Six (Quantum Behaviour) which save this book as they are easily the best two and the best advertisement for Feynman. These last two lectures have the most interesting content and we can see how Feynman excels in explaining these difficult concepts.Overall the book hasn't inspired me to tackle more of Feynman's lectures although the final two lectures came close. There are better and more up to date explanations of many of the concepts tackled in this book. I think it's worth reading, it's a very short and quick read, but don't go in to it expecting to learn much physics."
498,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18566696-nitin-dangwal,4,"Richard Feynman was on my to-read list for a long time. I have heard a lot about his teaching methods. His crystal-clear thought that made him teach the most difficult subjects in the most easiest of methods. Given this, I had a lot of expectations from this book. And I was not disappointed.The book is a primer to anyone who wants to brush up their understanding of the basics in Physics. But unlike the books that we have studied, this book is not a bland narration of the concepts. Rather in your hand, this book is alive, with one of the best teachers of the physics speaking to you. Not one page of this short book is boring. And like a thriller, you turn page by page, trying to know what happens next. Almost every chapter of this gem of a book is amazing. But if asked my favorite, it has to be the chapter on Quantum Physics, and the explanation of dual nature of matter and the inherent uncertainty of the quantum world. I find Quantum Physics for one simple reason. It has confounded both physics and religious alike. So weird is the world of quantum that it makes sense to neither of them. For physicists Quantum Physics provide observation that throw everything they have learnt and beliefs down to gutter. For religious person, the quanta world is nothing short than work of devil, where the world has no order - something that they attribute to the god. And what can they so, so astonishingly is the world of quantum. Particles behave likes waves. But when you take a light source to see what is happening, they start behaving like particles again. Nothing is 'is' there. It is always they could be 60% here, and 40% there. Nothing is certain. Everything is probabilistic. Quantum world apart, I love the book majorly for one reason. It sews everything from the concept of heat to the concept of planetary motion in one single narrative. I think this is the major thing that the science education lacks in today's world. So much we have divided physics from chemistry that we don't realize they are the part of one whole story. This book fills this gap. Must read for a light and entertaining read about basic physics"
499,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89960099-john-doe,4,"Yes, it's very much an introduction. Mainly provide a ""big picture"" which chronologically connected scattered topics of modern physics, and most contents are basically high school physics stuff.But still, it's nice to intuitively connecting the dots in your mind. It's a quick read for me 😁 since I was kinda boost on physics in high school period, literally top grades in physics, favorite part was electric circuits design.If it wasn't for something random I would be the kid who loves physics and studied physics all the way up to uni, gradschool, and PhD maybe. Nevertheless I was a kid came across book with words like nuclear physics at age 5. Anyway, reading felt like a breeze after so many years literally disconnected with any physics stuff. Why I picked up physics again, because I need to understand quantum mechanics, and need to understand higher level mathematics in a physics way not merely arithmetics way. There was a lack of visual intuition in advanced pure mathematics area, I think catching up with the area of physics may be the key to develop intuitions.Another interesting point, why Mr.Feynman had a subtle distaste for philosophy?I think Mr.Feynman simply adopted the uncomformist attitude for both personal life and academic breakthrough, and most of the times the reasonings of the majority of philosophers were kind of absolute, which is the very core against what science at the age often adopted, uncertainty or statistical or probabilistic thinking, in other words, everything is by chance not that absolute as philosophers usually argued. However I think that's not a very fair judgement for philosophy the subject in general, nevertheless, the founding father of probability theory Pascal was himself a great philosopher, had profound work not just about mathematics but about thoughts for life in general. Besides, the very thought or intuition of every mathematics breakthrough IS philosophical. Therefore you can not be both anti philosophy and chasing revolutionary breakthrough in whatever area, instead you have to be kinda of philosophical."
500,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110560654-samen-yasar,5,"In the early 60s at Caltech, student interest in physics started declining sharply among undergraduates. Years of rigorous training in the basics meant undergraduates largely weren't able to engage directly with the most recent advancements in the field. To restore motivation in students, the faculty asked Feynman, already quite famous by then, to teach a course on introductory physics to the freshman and sophomore classes. The result was a wonderful series of lectures that was later transcribed and became what is known today as ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". This book contains only six of the easiest and most accessible pieces from that collection.The lectures are true to the intent. Unlike a typical physics lecture, where complex math and sophisticated jargon reigns supreme, Feynman's discussions have the bare minimum of scientific jargon and almost no math. He gets to the essence of complex concepts with just simple thought experiments and intuitive diagrams. It feels almost as if he is telling a story, when in fact he is explaining a rather complicated concept. Though he primarily focuses on basic concepts, he doesn't shy away from connecting them to more advanced concepts whenever he can. Since it was set in the 60s, some parts of the text pertaining to modern physics is a bit outdated. But those aside the text is truly remarkable.If there is any text on physics at all that I would gladly recommend to any fellow non-physicist, it has to be this series of lectures. The text's usage of simple language and the deliberate omission of math lends itself to a very wide audience. Anyone with basic high school level math and science background should be able to follow through easily."
501,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1848040-gabriella-gricius,4,"Why Read: I love physics. I honestly really truly adore learning about physics. The small caveat is that I'm absolutely horrid at it. Learning about how the universe works (not really why, as Feynman points out) is something that I am not particularly gifted in. But nonetheless, I love reading about it. Review: I picked up Six Easy Pieces an age ago. I thought that it would be a great book for me because as previously mentioned, I'm not good at the subject. The basics are most definitely something that I could use a hand in. Everyone has heard of Feynman's lectures, they're practically famous and so reading the first six ""easy"" pieces felt like something doable.Let me disabuse you of that notion. Much as I enjoyed reading this book, I didn't find it doable or easy to comprehend. The first couple chapters are okay, when you learn about gravity and about the magnetic pulls between atoms and planets - but then... then comes the quantum mechanics. Then comes the simple act that physic researchers are just trying to figure out ""how"" things work, rather than ""why."" Before reading this book, I hadn't considered that physics as a science is a bit of a test of experimentation. On one hand, we learn new rules by experimenting and assume they are true until something goes horribly wrong. On the other one, however, we just exist in a state of chaos - never truly knowing about why rules are the way they are. Talk about frustrating.I admit that in reading this book, I was frustrated. I wanted to know about why certain particles acted in the ways they did and... the answers weren't provided to me. Granted, no scientist has the answer so I shouldn't expect a ""Physics for Dummies"" book to help me. Still. It's a fascinating read, and it's not particularly easy.

502,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66906861-megawhoppingcosmicbookwyrm,4,"Quite the introduction to Physics! The only reason it doesn’t get five stars is due to my own limitations of absorbing the material put forth. Feynman is a fantastic educator and communicator, and even my poor excuse for a brain was able to glean a much better understanding of the subject.I didn’t do well with Science in school. Looking back, I can honestly say it was an equal mix of my not trying hard enough, and my writing off scientists as ‘evil people against my religion’; a detrimental state of mind inherited from my family. I’ve never studied Physics at all, and still enjoyed this book immensely.I would suggest only reading this if you truly have a longing to understand the universe more. It’s not something to pick up as a ‘light, entertaining read’ for a vacation or airplane ride... And be prepared for SO many equations.I’ll admit, I’m definitely a Feynman fangirl now. I never paid nearly as much attention to any other science than Biology, and I’m glad I’ve found more areas of interest to expand my horizons. I have Mr. Feynman to thank for that. His words have lit up a passion in me similar to how I felt when I read Darwin and Dawkins. I’m not a scientist, a teacher, or particularly clever by any means, but having people who are all of those things; and that are able to explain mind-boggling things to me so succinctly; is a truly marvelous feat. I am forever grateful to the great minds of this world."
503,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72049690-moe,3,"“Six Easy Pieces” by Richard Feynman teaches the reader about the most important six fundamental laws of physics and their relationship with other sciences like biology, chemistry and psychology. Feynman is a brilliant teacher and, he’s arguably one of the smartest scientists in the 19th century next to Prof. Hawking and Einstein. People also believe that Feynman would have discovered “The General Relativity Theory” if Einstein had not done so. I’ve watched some of his lectures & interviews online and i was very impressed, which is why i’ve decided to invest my money & time in buying and reading one of his books. I have to be honest and say that the book is not as easy to understand as one might think. It is not for those that have no physics background at all. I had difficulties when Feynman talked about basic physics and chemistry facts, it was too dry & somehow really complicated. It was not easy to follow up and to understand the content. But, maybe, i lack the minimum knowledge one must have in order to start listening to a great scientist like Feynman in the first place, that is a very good argument indeed. On the contrary, there’re beautiful examples in this book. His ways of explaining complex subjects with simple examples is phenomenal. - Moe xx..."

I was completely lost at some point after the atomic deep dive though, but for good reason according to Feynman, for “Things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale.” and we have to use our imagination when it comes to the quantum. I’m more interested to see how physics can be stretched to philosophy like the incessant movement of atoms and how our body is continually changing even if there are no outward manifestations.I added this book to my reading list after Naval cited it in a podcast I was listening to, walking towards City Super buying a perk me up afternoon drink.***Quotes:What looks like a dead, uninteresting thing — a glass of water with a cover, that has been sitting there for perhaps twenty years — really contains a dynamic and interesting phenomenon which is going on all the time. To our eyes, our crude eyes, nothing is changing, but if we could see it a billion times magnified, we would see that from its own point of view it is always changing: molecules are leaving the surface, molecules are coming back.“Why does a frog jump?” and the physicist cannot answer."

Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces speaks about six basic topics involved in Physics in a good, enjoyable and yes in a basic yet comprehensive way. The first chapter describes atoms in detailed, their functionality. The second and the third chapter describe physics and its relation to other sciences, good stuff. To be honest, I think the fourth (Conservation of Energy), fifth (The Theory of Gravitation) and sixth (Quantum Behavior - undoubtedly the heart of the book) were the best chapters in the book. I will not go into details as I don't want my review to be a complete spoiler.Just about the last chapter - It speaks and describes ""The Double Slit"" experiment beautifully like I have never understood it before, very detailed. This one chapter is undoubtedly the gem of the book.I'd definitely recommend this book to starters in Physics as well as to the experienced people in Physics (though you'd have known most of it - you can enjoy Feynman's deep insights).I am looking forward to getting hold of Six not-so Easy Pieces but not anytime soon..."

Accessible does not mean easy, and the book finds a delicate balance to discuss the complex topics+ Very well written or lectured. This was an enjoyable read start to finish as I enjoy Feynman's unique way of explaining things. + Honest and sincere. Where we haven't explored theory enough Feynman will quickly conclude ""we don't know"" and ""we must then find out""Cons- Definitely have to be interested in the topic (duh) but this isn't a book to take a risk on. If physics and the way our universe works is not interesting to you, you will get lost in this book and be unable to follow along- the first half of the book is the real ""easy"" bit and therefore it's critical to consider what easy really means. In this context, easy for students of physics at university level. - very minor gripe, but the formatting of the book.

If you're expecting the jovial, self-aggrandizing Feynman of ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character, you're not going to get him here. This is Professor Feynman cleaned up for the classroom, and cleaned up further for mass ""respectable"" publication.The most illuminating part of this book was by far the quantum mechanics chapter, followed by the very basic chapters on basic molecular structure and physical states. Weirdly, the most obtuse chapters for me were on basic principles of force and energy. The diagrams did nothing for me there. I think a static medium of printed words and diagrams is maybe not the best for that subject."

I had had it recommended to me via a Youtube video by Simon Clark. Anyway, I read it while on vacation and it was really, really good. It presents physics in a way that makes it easy to understand without hiding the details. I must admit that some parts were a little hard to understand and concepts were harder to grasp at some parts of the book. I think this is mainly due to my then younger age and the fact that I am a non-native speaker. I do still recommend it to everyone though. The book is perfect for anyone who thinks that they might enjoy physics and wants a first glance over the concepts. It introduces the concepts of basic principles such as conservation of energy all the way to more modern, advanced concepts such as quantum physics (although briefly and graspable). This book has been really important to me. I've only read it once, but the thought concepts presented in that book has been with me ever since I read it and helped me a lot in school to understand new concepts."
509,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67149971-elizabeth-saunders,3,"	In reading the book, ""Six Easy Pieces"" by Richard Feynman, there was one primary thing that I noticed. I consider myself to be a little bit more of a history or math oriented person, and I am even more confident about that now after reading the book. Not to say that the book didn't do a good job of simplifying some of Feynman's key points in physics- I believe it does just that. I understand that I am not part of the ""target audience"" from the book, which is why I feel like I didn't retain a whole lot of the more complicated parts. 	The lectures were definitely geared for the top tier science students. Also, at times, I found it a tad difficult to maintain a consistent level of interest through the passages with more data-heavy detail, as you might expect from a science lecture book. As a whole, though, I would say the book was very informative and an interesting read throughout.

523,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6470362-jean-tessier,5,"I while back, I bought a book that introduced math topics to the lay person. This looked like it could do the same for physics. And by none other than Richard Feynman himself.Feynman goes for a more intuitive approach and avoids any complex mathematics. His explanations and examples are strikingly clear. The jiggling of atoms explain the difference between solid, liquid, and gaseous states. Changing arrangements explain chemical reactions, like burning carbon. Everything is made out of atoms, with patterns that defy the imagination.I struggled through the chapter on the conservation of energy. One take-away is that we can explain limits in nature using reversible machines, even though there are no reversible machines in nature. The chapters on gravitation and quantum mechanics were exceedingly clear. The chapter on how physics relates to the other sciences was a lot of fun. So, too, the chapter on gravitation.Tycho Brahe had an idea that was different from anything proposed by the ancients [...] that to find something out, it is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophical arguments. (p. 90) Tycho Brahe took measurements, Kepler deduced laws from these measurements, Galileo figured out inertia, and Newton formulated the law of gravitation (which was later refined by Einstein).I really like how Feynman repeatedly states the limits of science. There are many things that we simply do not know. For now. There may be things we will never know, but many phenomena in the past were deemed inexplicable, only to be explained later.It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. (p. 71) the principle of inertia — if something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.) (p. 93) All we have done is to describe how the earth moves around the sun, but we have not said what makes it go. (p. 107) No one has since given any machinery. (p. 107) Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. (p. 116) Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. (p. 117) According to Feynman, the fact that there are things we do not know does not mean that we are ignorant. We can explain the limits of how things operate with great precision, even though we cannot explain why.About the conservation of energy:There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law -- it is exact so far as we know. (p. 69) As I was reading the book, I often found myself wondering how much progress we've made since it had been written. For instance, in last year's Outgrowing God, Richard Dawkins makes a case for complex chemistry inevitably leads to self-replicating molecules like RNA and DNA, and eventually living organisms.Feynman does not reduce everything to physics. He acknowledges that there are areas of human knowledge outside of science.If something is said not to be a science, it does not mean that there something wrong with it; it just means that it is not a science. (p. 47) "

I'm not a fan of the paper and the typeface size, and well to me, it takes away from the smooth flow of the much bigger pages of the original book.It just gives me a claustrophobic feeling.---I need those lectures with the pages extra three inches wider, and four inches taller!!---I was given the whole set, since i had trouble trying to find the original red hardcovers in good shape [they always seemed to be warped], and I found them somewhat rough going when I faced Heisenberg's Uncertainity Principle for the first time, I took a break... I took a break and tried again a while later....He was talking about calculating the orbit of one planet and I struggled in places.Anyways, i decided to take a break for a month or two, and i did exactly what Issac Newton did, i decided to reread things all over again, right from the beginning.I simply burned through the first 100-150 pages of the Feynman Lectures and enjoyed it.But i had two small moments where I realized i was rushing things, and decided, later... later...I couldn't have as much fun browsing Vol II because of the calculus, even though i had the math knowledge at the time, but not the introductory calculus-level university level EM, so browsing those early on, i realized i would face some struggles.[I actually spoke to someone once who went to Caltech in the 60s, and he said that he thought Feynman's Lectures were brutal. He couldn't remember his other textbooks, but i really appreciated his insight 20 years later]It really bums me out since Feynman's writing really is beautiful and deep, and i see a lot of slightly unhappy folks picking up this book and having a hard time with it.I totally sympathize, because i felt let down that my concentration didn't flow with the page as easily, as I thought it might with a neat little hardcover.All I can say is that lots of people who experienced the Lectures in the day, some people were frustrated, and some people were blown away, and some experienced both.----All i can say is that reread the book very slowly and patiently, or borrow a copy of Volume One of the full lectures at the library and browse through them, an read the first 30 pages.and please please please READ, Feynman's autobiography firstSurely You're Joking Mister Feynman [Part I]What Do You Care What Other People Think?

525,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"I read this for all the wrong reasons. It was short and I wanted one more book for the month, and I knew I could blitz through all the basic science blah. I blitzed, it wasn't basic, I learned nothing except that I was insufferable and needed to stop this obnoxious book-counting. Also, Feynman was inappropriate and a irrascible, didn't knew. The writing is easy, likeable, and clear, I really wish I'd been able to sit in on one of his lectures, those must have been incredible. But I guess I had the next best thing, Bharatidasan kicking me out for the 10th time in a week because I wasn't adequately spellbound by his reading out from the illustrated guide to the simplified extract of Indian transliteration to the official university textbook of Electrical Machines I, complete with bad grammar, formula errors, and all the sweet smelling dryness of cow-dung prepared for fuel, which is apt because those books were some of the few that deserved to be taken to 451 fahrenheit. Clippingsphilosophically we are completely wrong with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws. Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas.From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics. This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric field and charges,The masses given here are the masses of the particles at rest. The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot be at rest.it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth.When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is deflected."
526,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45200517-simon-zou,4,"This is book is great. I started to read it on the recommendation of a professor in Computer Science and because I wanted to ""like"" physics more, as opposed to thinking it's this hard, scary thing. To that end, it's worked, I like physics more than when I started. On the ""Easy"" in the title: The premise of the book is that, of Feyman's lectures on physics, these are the 6 easiest, digestable for a layman with little to no background in the sciences. So I listened to the first couple chapters as an audiobook. The audiobook uses the recordings from the real lectures and are awesome. The written version drops some of his character and jokes in exchange for clarity so it's nice to get both. Feynman waxes poetry about rocks and moons and atoms and how physics relates to other sciences and it's pretty marvelous. However, once at chapter 4, on the conservation of energy, just listening becomes untenable. There are diagrams and equations and concepts that required my full attention to grasp. I switched from listening to reading, to listening and reading at the same time, to asking myself ""at this point why don't I just watch the lectures on YouTube?"". I did that, and all was good. The explanation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics in particular would be pretty hard to get without looking at the diagrams but with them it makes sense, or rather, explains the consistent way in which quantum doesn't make sense. One thing I noticed from perusing all these mediums is that Amazon keeps track of ""popular"" highlights in books and shows them to you. These were far more prevalent in the first three chapters. I wish they made available (but understand why they don't) other stats because I would guess that chapter 4 is where people might have given up on the book. The title says these pieces are ""easy"", but the last few chapters require your full attention and some quantitative reasoning skills to grasp. It's not so easy that I could fully digest the ideas half paying attention while doing the dishes, as was closer to the case with the earlier chapters. Feynman also uses imaginary ""reversible"" machines to explain energy concepts and I'm still not sure I like that or really get what those are about."
527,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97017413-john,3,"This is quite difficult to review. I knew of Feynman (obviously) but hadn't read or seen his famous early 60s lectures before. This book exists as an introduction to the man and his teaching methods but I'm not convinced it does a particularly good job.Definitely don't read this if you want to learn anything about physics, some of the material is very dated (a lot has happened in the world of physics in the last 56 years). Some of it is still relevant but if you didn't know what how would you pick this out from the irrelevant? The blurb on the book says ""the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics"" and I would strongly dispute that.The book gets off to a decent start, the prefaces and introduction set the scene, they tell us that the lecture series wasn't actually that successful with only a few students present targetted by the material so it's hardly surprising only a few stuck with them. Lecture One (Atoms in Motion) is good, a nice introduction to Feynman's method and the subject matter is gentle and well described. But Lecture Two (Basic Physics) is a disaster IMHO, it's a complete mess with Feynman jumping all over the place and not really explaining anything properly and leaving the reader totally confused. Lecture Three (Relationship of Physics to Other Sciences) is very biology biased and spends a lot of time on enzymes. Other sciences are briefly mentioned or pretty much dismissed, geology and meteorology get very short shrift and only go to emphasise how dated the material is. Lecture Four (Conservation of Energy) is better and thank goodness for Lecture Five (Gravitation) and Lecture Six (Quantum Behaviour) which save this book as they are easily the best two and the best advertisement for Feynman. These last two lectures have the most interesting content and we can see how Feynman excels in explaining these difficult concepts.Overall the book hasn't inspired me to tackle more of Feynman's lectures although the final two lectures came close. There are better and more up to date explanations of many of the concepts tackled in this book. I think it's worth reading, it's a very short and quick read, but don't go in to it expecting to learn much physics."
528,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18566696-nitin-dangwal,4,"Richard Feynman was on my to-read list for a long time. I have heard a lot about his teaching methods. His crystal-clear thought that made him teach the most difficult subjects in the most easiest of methods. Given this, I had a lot of expectations from this book. And I was not disappointed.The book is a primer to anyone who wants to brush up their understanding of the basics in Physics. But unlike the books that we have studied, this book is not a bland narration of the concepts. Rather in your hand, this book is alive, with one of the best teachers of the physics speaking to you. Not one page of this short book is boring. And like a thriller, you turn page by page, trying to know what happens next. Almost every chapter of this gem of a book is amazing. But if asked my favorite, it has to be the chapter on Quantum Physics, and the explanation of dual nature of matter and the inherent uncertainty of the quantum world. I find Quantum Physics for one simple reason. It has confounded both physics and religious alike. So weird is the world of quantum that it makes sense to neither of them. For physicists Quantum Physics provide observation that throw everything they have learnt and beliefs down to gutter. For religious person, the quanta world is nothing short than work of devil, where the world has no order - something that they attribute to the god. And what can they so, so astonishingly is the world of quantum. Particles behave likes waves. But when you take a light source to see what is happening, they start behaving like particles again. Nothing is 'is' there. It is always they could be 60% here, and 40% there. Nothing is certain. Everything is probabilistic. Quantum world apart, I love the book majorly for one reason. It sews everything from the concept of heat to the concept of planetary motion in one single narrative. I think this is the major thing that the science education lacks in today's world. So much we have divided physics from chemistry that we don't realize they are the part of one whole story. This book fills this gap. Must read for a light and entertaining read about basic physics"
529,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89960099-john-doe,4,"Yes, it's very much an introduction. Mainly provide a ""big picture"" which chronologically connected scattered topics of modern physics, and most contents are basically high school physics stuff.But still, it's nice to intuitively connecting the dots in your mind. It's a quick read for me 😁 since I was kinda boost on physics in high school period, literally top grades in physics, favorite part was electric circuits design.If it wasn't for something random I would be the kid who loves physics and studied physics all the way up to uni, gradschool, and PhD maybe. Nevertheless I was a kid came across book with words like nuclear physics at age 5. Anyway, reading felt like a breeze after so many years literally disconnected with any physics stuff. Why I picked up physics again, because I need to understand quantum mechanics, and need to understand higher level mathematics in a physics way not merely arithmetics way. There was a lack of visual intuition in advanced pure mathematics area, I think catching up with the area of physics may be the key to develop intuitions.Another interesting point, why Mr.Feynman had a subtle distaste for philosophy?I think Mr.Feynman simply adopted the uncomformist attitude for both personal life and academic breakthrough, and most of the times the reasonings of the majority of philosophers were kind of absolute, which is the very core against what science at the age often adopted, uncertainty or statistical or probabilistic thinking, in other words, everything is by chance not that absolute as philosophers usually argued. However I think that's not a very fair judgement for philosophy the subject in general, nevertheless, the founding father of probability theory Pascal was himself a great philosopher, had profound work not just about mathematics but about thoughts for life in general. Besides, the very thought or intuition of every mathematics breakthrough IS philosophical. Therefore you can not be both anti philosophy and chasing revolutionary breakthrough in whatever area, instead you have to be kinda of philosophical."
530,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110560654-samen-yasar,5,"In the early 60s at Caltech, student interest in physics started declining sharply among undergraduates. Years of rigorous training in the basics meant undergraduates largely weren't able to engage directly with the most recent advancements in the field. To restore motivation in students, the faculty asked Feynman, already quite famous by then, to teach a course on introductory physics to the freshman and sophomore classes. The result was a wonderful series of lectures that was later transcribed and became what is known today as ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". This book contains only six of the easiest and most accessible pieces from that collection.The lectures are true to the intent. Unlike a typical physics lecture, where complex math and sophisticated jargon reigns supreme, Feynman's discussions have the bare minimum of scientific jargon and almost no math. He gets to the essence of complex concepts with just simple thought experiments and intuitive diagrams. It feels almost as if he is telling a story, when in fact he is explaining a rather complicated concept. Though he primarily focuses on basic concepts, he doesn't shy away from connecting them to more advanced concepts whenever he can. Since it was set in the 60s, some parts of the text pertaining to modern physics is a bit outdated. But those aside the text is truly remarkable.If there is any text on physics at all that I would gladly recommend to any fellow non-physicist, it has to be this series of lectures. The text's usage of simple language and the deliberate omission of math lends itself to a very wide audience.

The small caveat is that I'm absolutely horrid at it. Learning about how the universe works (not really why, as Feynman points out) is something that I am not particularly gifted in. But nonetheless, I love reading about it. Review: I picked up Six Easy Pieces an age ago. I thought that it would be a great book for me because as previously mentioned, I'm not good at the subject. The basics are most definitely something that I could use a hand in. Everyone has heard of Feynman's lectures, they're practically famous and so reading the first six ""easy"" pieces felt like something doable.Let me disabuse you of that notion. Much as I enjoyed reading this book, I didn't find it doable or easy to comprehend. The first couple chapters are okay, when you learn about gravity and about the magnetic pulls between atoms and planets - but then... then comes the quantum mechanics. Then comes the simple act that physic researchers are just trying to figure out ""how"" things work, rather than ""why."" Before reading this book, I hadn't considered that physics as a science is a bit of a test of experimentation. On one hand, we learn new rules by experimenting and assume they are true until something goes horribly wrong. On the other one, however, we just exist in a state of chaos - never truly knowing about why rules are the way they are. Talk about frustrating.I admit that in reading this book, I was frustrated. I wanted to know about why certain particles acted in the ways they did and... the answers weren't provided to me. Granted, no scientist has the answer so I shouldn't expect a ""Physics for Dummies"" book to help me. Still. It's a fascinating read, and it's not particularly easy. But give it a whirl, and you will be proud of yourself. Rating: 4/5 Stars"
532,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66906861-megawhoppingcosmicbookwyrm,4,"Quite the introduction to Physics! The only reason it doesn’t get five stars is due to my own limitations of absorbing the material put forth. Feynman is a fantastic educator and communicator, and even my poor excuse for a brain was able to glean a much better understanding of the subject.I didn’t do well with Science in school. Looking back, I can honestly say it was an equal mix of my not trying hard enough, and my writing off scientists as ‘evil people against my religion’; a detrimental state of mind inherited from my family. I’ve never studied Physics at all, and still enjoyed this book immensely.I would suggest only reading this if you truly have a longing to understand the universe more. It’s not something to pick up as a ‘light, entertaining read’ for a vacation or airplane ride... And be prepared for SO many equations.I’ll admit, I’m definitely a Feynman fangirl now. I never paid nearly as much attention to any other science than Biology, and I’m glad I’ve found more areas of interest to expand my horizons. I have Mr. Feynman to thank for that. His words have lit up a passion in me similar to how I felt when I read Darwin and Dawkins. I’m not a scientist, a teacher, or particularly clever by any means, but having people who are all of those things; and that are able to explain mind-boggling things to me so succinctly; is a truly marvelous feat. I am forever grateful to the great minds of this world."

Feynman is a brilliant teacher and, he’s arguably one of the smartest scientists in the 19th century next to Prof. Hawking and Einstein. People also believe that Feynman would have discovered “The General Relativity Theory” if Einstein had not done so. I’ve watched some of his lectures & interviews online and i was very impressed, which is why i’ve decided to invest my money & time in buying and reading one of his books. I have to be honest and say that the book is not as easy to understand as one might think. It is not for those that have no physics background at all. I had difficulties when Feynman talked about basic physics and chemistry facts, it was too dry & somehow really complicated. It was not easy to follow up and to understand the content. But, maybe, i lack the minimum knowledge one must have in order to start listening to a great scientist like Feynman in the first place, that is a very good argument indeed. On the contrary, there’re beautiful examples in this book. His ways of explaining complex subjects with simple examples is phenomenal. - Moe xx..."

I was completely lost at some point after the atomic deep dive though, but for good reason according to Feynman, for “Things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale.” and we have to use our imagination when it comes to the quantum. I’m more interested to see how physics can be stretched to philosophy like the incessant movement of atoms and how our body is continually changing even if there are no outward manifestations.I added this book to my reading list after Naval cited it in a podcast I was listening to, walking towards City Super buying a perk me up afternoon drink.***Quotes:What looks like a dead, uninteresting thing — a glass of water with a cover, that has been sitting there for perhaps twenty years — really contains a dynamic and interesting phenomenon which is going on all the time.

Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces speaks about six basic topics involved in Physics in a good, enjoyable and yes in a basic yet comprehensive way. The first chapter describes atoms in detailed, their functionality. The second and the third chapter describe physics and its relation to other sciences, good stuff. To be honest, I think the fourth (Conservation of Energy), fifth (The Theory of Gravitation) and sixth (Quantum Behavior - undoubtedly the heart of the book) were the best chapters in the book. I will not go into details as I don't want my review to be a complete spoiler.Just about the last chapter - It speaks and describes ""The Double Slit"" experiment beautifully like I have never understood it before, very detailed. This one chapter is undoubtedly the gem of the book.I'd definitely recommend this book to starters in Physics as well as to the experienced people in Physics (though you'd have known most of it - you can enjoy Feynman's deep insights).I am looking forward to getting hold of Six not-so Easy Pieces but not anytime soon..."

Accessible does not mean easy, and the book finds a delicate balance to discuss the complex topics+ Very well written or lectured. This was an enjoyable read start to finish as I enjoy Feynman's unique way of explaining things. + Honest and sincere. Where we haven't explored theory enough Feynman will quickly conclude ""we don't know"" and ""we must then find out""Cons- Definitely have to be interested in the topic (duh) but this isn't a book to take a risk on. If physics and the way our universe works is not interesting to you, you will get lost in this book and be unable to follow along- the first half of the book is the real ""easy"" bit and therefore it's critical to consider what easy really means. In this context, easy for students of physics at university level. - very minor gripe, but the formatting of the book. Feynman will discuss topics and the related figure or diagram won't be until the next page; frustrating if you're genuinely interested in pursuing this as a learning resource."

If you're expecting the jovial, self-aggrandizing Feynman of ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character, you're not going to get him here. This is Professor Feynman cleaned up for the classroom, and cleaned up further for mass ""respectable"" publication.The most illuminating part of this book was by far the quantum mechanics chapter, followed by the very basic chapters on basic molecular structure and physical states. Weirdly, the most obtuse chapters for me were on basic principles of force and energy. The diagrams did nothing for me there. I think a static medium of printed words and diagrams is maybe not the best for that subject."

I had had it recommended to me via a Youtube video by Simon Clark. Anyway, I read it while on vacation and it was really, really good. It presents physics in a way that makes it easy to understand without hiding the details. I must admit that some parts were a little hard to understand and concepts were harder to grasp at some parts of the book. I think this is mainly due to my then younger age and the fact that I am a non-native speaker. I do still recommend it to everyone though. The book is perfect for anyone who thinks that they might enjoy physics and wants a first glance over the concepts. It introduces the concepts of basic principles such as conservation of energy all the way to more modern, advanced concepts such as quantum physics (although briefly and graspable). This book has been really important to me. I've only read it once, but the thought concepts presented in that book has been with me ever since I read it and helped me a lot in school to understand new concepts."

I consider myself to be a little bit more of a history or math oriented person, and I am even more confident about that now after reading the book. Not to say that the book didn't do a good job of simplifying some of Feynman's key points in physics- I believe it does just that. I understand that I am not part of the ""target audience"" from the book, which is why I feel like I didn't retain a whole lot of the more complicated parts. 	The lectures were definitely geared for the top tier science students. Also, at times, I found it a tad difficult to maintain a consistent level of interest through the passages with more data-heavy detail, as you might expect from a science lecture book. As a whole, though, I would say the book was very informative and an interesting read throughout.

553,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6470362-jean-tessier,5,"I while back, I bought a book that introduced math topics to the lay person. This looked like it could do the same for physics. And by none other than Richard Feynman himself.Feynman goes for a more intuitive approach and avoids any complex mathematics. His explanations and examples are strikingly clear. The jiggling of atoms explain the difference between solid, liquid, and gaseous states. Changing arrangements explain chemical reactions, like burning carbon. Everything is made out of atoms, with patterns that defy the imagination.I struggled through the chapter on the conservation of energy. One take-away is that we can explain limits in nature using reversible machines, even though there are no reversible machines in nature. The chapters on gravitation and quantum mechanics were exceedingly clear. The chapter on how physics relates to the other sciences was a lot of fun. So, too, the chapter on gravitation.Tycho Brahe had an idea that was different from anything proposed by the ancients [...] that to find something out, it is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophical arguments. (p. 90) Tycho Brahe took measurements, Kepler deduced laws from these measurements, Galileo figured out inertia, and Newton formulated the law of gravitation (which was later refined by Einstein).I really like how Feynman repeatedly states the limits of science. There are many things that we simply do not know. For now. There may be things we will never know, but many phenomena in the past were deemed inexplicable, only to be explained later.It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. (p. 71) the principle of inertia — if something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.) (p. 93) All we have done is to describe how the earth moves around the sun, but we have not said what makes it go. (p. 107) No one has since given any machinery. (p. 107) Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. (p. 116) Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. (p. 117) According to Feynman, the fact that there are things we do not know does not mean that we are ignorant. We can explain the limits of how things operate with great precision, even though we cannot explain why.About the conservation of energy:There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law -- it is exact so far as we know. (p. 69) As I was reading the book, I often found myself wondering how much progress we've made since it had been written. For instance, in last year's Outgrowing God, Richard Dawkins makes a case for complex chemistry inevitably leads to self-replicating molecules like RNA and DNA, and eventually living organisms.Feynman does not reduce everything to physics. He acknowledges that there are areas of human knowledge outside of science.If something is said not to be a science, it does not mean that there something wrong with it; it just means that it is not a science. (p. 47) "

I'm not a fan of the paper and the typeface size, and well to me, it takes away from the smooth flow of the much bigger pages of the original book.It just gives me a claustrophobic feeling.---I need those lectures with the pages extra three inches wider, and four inches taller!!---I was given the whole set, since i had trouble trying to find the original red hardcovers in good shape [they always seemed to be warped], and I found them somewhat rough going when I faced Heisenberg's Uncertainity Principle for the first time, I took a break... I took a break and tried again a while later....He was talking about calculating the orbit of one planet and I struggled in places.Anyways, i decided to take a break for a month or two, and i did exactly what Issac Newton did, i decided to reread things all over again, right from the beginning.I simply burned through the first 100-150 pages of the Feynman Lectures and enjoyed it.But i had two small moments where I realized i was rushing things, and decided, later... later...I couldn't have as much fun browsing Vol II because of the calculus, even though i had the math knowledge at the time, but not the introductory calculus-level university level EM, so browsing those early on, i realized i would face some struggles.[I actually spoke to someone once who went to Caltech in the 60s, and he said that he thought Feynman's Lectures were brutal. He couldn't remember his other textbooks, but i really appreciated his insight 20 years later]It really bums me out since Feynman's writing really is beautiful and deep, and i see a lot of slightly unhappy folks picking up this book and having a hard time with it.I totally sympathize, because i felt let down that my concentration didn't flow with the page as easily, as I thought it might with a neat little hardcover.All I can say is that lots of people who experienced the Lectures in the day, some people were frustrated, and some people were blown away, and some experienced both.----All i can say is that reread the book very slowly and patiently, or borrow a copy of Volume One of the full lectures at the library and browse through them, an read the first 30 pages.and please please please READ, Feynman's autobiography firstSurely You're Joking Mister Feynman [Part I]What Do You Care What Other People Think?

555,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"I read this for all the wrong reasons. It was short and I wanted one more book for the month, and I knew I could blitz through all the basic science blah. I blitzed, it wasn't basic, I learned nothing except that I was insufferable and needed to stop this obnoxious book-counting. Also, Feynman was inappropriate and a irrascible, didn't knew. The writing is easy, likeable, and clear, I really wish I'd been able to sit in on one of his lectures, those must have been incredible. But I guess I had the next best thing, Bharatidasan kicking me out for the 10th time in a week because I wasn't adequately spellbound by his reading out from the illustrated guide to the simplified extract of Indian transliteration to the official university textbook of Electrical Machines I, complete with bad grammar, formula errors, and all the sweet smelling dryness of cow-dung prepared for fuel, which is apt because those books were some of the few that deserved to be taken to 451 fahrenheit. Clippingsphilosophically we are completely wrong with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws. Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas.From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics. This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric field and charges,The masses given here are the masses of the particles at rest. The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot be at rest.it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth.When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is deflected."
556,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45200517-simon-zou,4,"This is book is great. I started to read it on the recommendation of a professor in Computer Science and because I wanted to ""like"" physics more, as opposed to thinking it's this hard, scary thing. To that end, it's worked, I like physics more than when I started. On the ""Easy"" in the title: The premise of the book is that, of Feyman's lectures on physics, these are the 6 easiest, digestable for a layman with little to no background in the sciences. So I listened to the first couple chapters as an audiobook. The audiobook uses the recordings from the real lectures and are awesome. The written version drops some of his character and jokes in exchange for clarity so it's nice to get both. Feynman waxes poetry about rocks and moons and atoms and how physics relates to other sciences and it's pretty marvelous. However, once at chapter 4, on the conservation of energy, just listening becomes untenable. There are diagrams and equations and concepts that required my full attention to grasp. I switched from listening to reading, to listening and reading at the same time, to asking myself ""at this point why don't I just watch the lectures on YouTube?"". I did that, and all was good. The explanation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics in particular would be pretty hard to get without looking at the diagrams but with them it makes sense, or rather, explains the consistent way in which quantum doesn't make sense. One thing I noticed from perusing all these mediums is that Amazon keeps track of ""popular"" highlights in books and shows them to you. These were far more prevalent in the first three chapters. I wish they made available (but understand why they don't) other stats because I would guess that chapter 4 is where people might have given up on the book. The title says these pieces are ""easy"", but the last few chapters require your full attention and some quantitative reasoning skills to grasp. It's not so easy that I could fully digest the ideas half paying attention while doing the dishes, as was closer to the case with the earlier chapters. Feynman also uses imaginary ""reversible"" machines to explain energy concepts and I'm still not sure I like that or really get what those are about."
557,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97017413-john,3,"This is quite difficult to review. I knew of Feynman (obviously) but hadn't read or seen his famous early 60s lectures before. This book exists as an introduction to the man and his teaching methods but I'm not convinced it does a particularly good job.Definitely don't read this if you want to learn anything about physics, some of the material is very dated (a lot has happened in the world of physics in the last 56 years). Some of it is still relevant but if you didn't know what how would you pick this out from the irrelevant? The blurb on the book says ""the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics"" and I would strongly dispute that.The book gets off to a decent start, the prefaces and introduction set the scene, they tell us that the lecture series wasn't actually that successful with only a few students present targetted by the material so it's hardly surprising only a few stuck with them. Lecture One (Atoms in Motion) is good, a nice introduction to Feynman's method and the subject matter is gentle and well described. But Lecture Two (Basic Physics) is a disaster IMHO, it's a complete mess with Feynman jumping all over the place and not really explaining anything properly and leaving the reader totally confused. Lecture Three (Relationship of Physics to Other Sciences) is very biology biased and spends a lot of time on enzymes. Other sciences are briefly mentioned or pretty much dismissed, geology and meteorology get very short shrift and only go to emphasise how dated the material is. Lecture Four (Conservation of Energy) is better and thank goodness for Lecture Five (Gravitation) and Lecture Six (Quantum Behaviour) which save this book as they are easily the best two and the best advertisement for Feynman. These last two lectures have the most interesting content and we can see how Feynman excels in explaining these difficult concepts.Overall the book hasn't inspired me to tackle more of Feynman's lectures although the final two lectures came close. There are better and more up to date explanations of many of the concepts tackled in this book. I think it's worth reading, it's a very short and quick read, but don't go in to it expecting to learn much physics."
558,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18566696-nitin-dangwal,4,"Richard Feynman was on my to-read list for a long time. I have heard a lot about his teaching methods. His crystal-clear thought that made him teach the most difficult subjects in the most easiest of methods. Given this, I had a lot of expectations from this book. And I was not disappointed.The book is a primer to anyone who wants to brush up their understanding of the basics in Physics. But unlike the books that we have studied, this book is not a bland narration of the concepts. Rather in your hand, this book is alive, with one of the best teachers of the physics speaking to you. Not one page of this short book is boring. And like a thriller, you turn page by page, trying to know what happens next. Almost every chapter of this gem of a book is amazing. But if asked my favorite, it has to be the chapter on Quantum Physics, and the explanation of dual nature of matter and the inherent uncertainty of the quantum world. I find Quantum Physics for one simple reason. It has confounded both physics and religious alike. So weird is the world of quantum that it makes sense to neither of them. For physicists Quantum Physics provide observation that throw everything they have learnt and beliefs down to gutter. For religious person, the quanta world is nothing short than work of devil, where the world has no order - something that they attribute to the god. And what can they so, so astonishingly is the world of quantum. Particles behave likes waves. But when you take a light source to see what is happening, they start behaving like particles again. Nothing is 'is' there. It is always they could be 60% here, and 40% there. Nothing is certain. Everything is probabilistic. Quantum world apart, I love the book majorly for one reason. It sews everything from the concept of heat to the concept of planetary motion in one single narrative. I think this is the major thing that the science education lacks in today's world. So much we have divided physics from chemistry that we don't realize they are the part of one whole story. This book fills this gap. Must read for a light and entertaining read about basic physics"
559,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89960099-john-doe,4,"Yes, it's very much an introduction. Mainly provide a ""big picture"" which chronologically connected scattered topics of modern physics, and most contents are basically high school physics stuff.But still, it's nice to intuitively connecting the dots in your mind. It's a quick read for me 😁 since I was kinda boost on physics in high school period, literally top grades in physics, favorite part was electric circuits design.If it wasn't for something random I would be the kid who loves physics and studied physics all the way up to uni, gradschool, and PhD maybe. Nevertheless I was a kid came across book with words like nuclear physics at age 5. Anyway, reading felt like a breeze after so many years literally disconnected with any physics stuff. Why I picked up physics again, because I need to understand quantum mechanics, and need to understand higher level mathematics in a physics way not merely arithmetics way. There was a lack of visual intuition in advanced pure mathematics area, I think catching up with the area of physics may be the key to develop intuitions.Another interesting point, why Mr.Feynman had a subtle distaste for philosophy?I think Mr.Feynman simply adopted the uncomformist attitude for both personal life and academic breakthrough, and most of the times the reasonings of the majority of philosophers were kind of absolute, which is the very core against what science at the age often adopted, uncertainty or statistical or probabilistic thinking, in other words, everything is by chance not that absolute as philosophers usually argued. However I think that's not a very fair judgement for philosophy the subject in general, nevertheless, the founding father of probability theory Pascal was himself a great philosopher, had profound work not just about mathematics but about thoughts for life in general. Besides, the very thought or intuition of every mathematics breakthrough IS philosophical. Therefore you can not be both anti philosophy and chasing revolutionary breakthrough in whatever area, instead you have to be kinda of philosophical."
560,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110560654-samen-yasar,5,"In the early 60s at Caltech, student interest in physics started declining sharply among undergraduates. Years of rigorous training in the basics meant undergraduates largely weren't able to engage directly with the most recent advancements in the field. To restore motivation in students, the faculty asked Feynman, already quite famous by then, to teach a course on introductory physics to the freshman and sophomore classes. The result was a wonderful series of lectures that was later transcribed and became what is known today as ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". This book contains only six of the easiest and most accessible pieces from that collection.The lectures are true to the intent. Unlike a typical physics lecture, where complex math and sophisticated jargon reigns supreme, Feynman's discussions have the bare minimum of scientific jargon and almost no math. He gets to the essence of complex concepts with just simple thought experiments and intuitive diagrams. It feels almost as if he is telling a story, when in fact he is explaining a rather complicated concept. Though he primarily focuses on basic concepts, he doesn't shy away from connecting them to more advanced concepts whenever he can. Since it was set in the 60s, some parts of the text pertaining to modern physics is a bit outdated. But those aside the text is truly remarkable.If there is any text on physics at all that I would gladly recommend to any fellow non-physicist, it has to be this series of lectures. The text's usage of simple language and the deliberate omission of math lends itself to a very wide audience. Anyone with basic high school level math and science background should be able to follow through easily."
561,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1848040-gabriella-gricius,4,"Why Read: I love physics. I honestly really truly adore learning about physics. The small caveat is that I'm absolutely horrid at it. Learning about how the universe works (not really why, as Feynman points out) is something that I am not particularly gifted in. But nonetheless, I love reading about it. Review: I picked up Six Easy Pieces an age ago. I thought that it would be a great book for me because as previously mentioned, I'm not good at the subject. The basics are most definitely something that I could use a hand in. Everyone has heard of Feynman's lectures, they're practically famous and so reading the first six ""easy"" pieces felt like something doable.Let me disabuse you of that notion. Much as I enjoyed reading this book, I didn't find it doable or easy to comprehend. The first couple chapters are okay, when you learn about gravity and about the magnetic pulls between atoms and planets - but then... then comes the quantum mechanics. Then comes the simple act that physic researchers are just trying to figure out ""how"" things work, rather than ""why."" Before reading this book, I hadn't considered that physics as a science is a bit of a test of experimentation. On one hand, we learn new rules by experimenting and assume they are true until something goes horribly wrong. On the other one, however, we just exist in a state of chaos - never truly knowing about why rules are the way they are. Talk about frustrating.I admit that in reading this book, I was frustrated. I wanted to know about why certain particles acted in the ways they did and... the answers weren't provided to me. Granted, no scientist has the answer so I shouldn't expect a ""Physics for Dummies"" book to help me. Still. It's a fascinating read, and it's not particularly easy. But give it a whirl, and you will be proud of yourself. Rating: 4/5 Stars"

The only reason it doesn’t get five stars is due to my own limitations of absorbing the material put forth. Feynman is a fantastic educator and communicator, and even my poor excuse for a brain was able to glean a much better understanding of the subject.I didn’t do well with Science in school. Looking back, I can honestly say it was an equal mix of my not trying hard enough, and my writing off scientists as ‘evil people against my religion’; a detrimental state of mind inherited from my family. I’ve never studied Physics at all, and still enjoyed this book immensely.I would suggest only reading this if you truly have a longing to understand the universe more. It’s not something to pick up as a ‘light, entertaining read’ for a vacation or airplane ride... And be prepared for SO many equations.I’ll admit, I’m definitely a Feynman fangirl now. I never paid nearly as much attention to any other science than Biology, and I’m glad I’ve found more areas of interest to expand my horizons. I have Mr. Feynman to thank for that. His words have lit up a passion in me similar to how I felt when I read Darwin and Dawkins. I’m not a scientist, a teacher, or particularly clever by any means, but having people who are all of those things; and that are able to explain mind-boggling things to me so succinctly; is a truly marvelous feat. I am forever grateful to the great minds of this world."

Feynman is a brilliant teacher and, he’s arguably one of the smartest scientists in the 19th century next to Prof. Hawking and Einstein. People also believe that Feynman would have discovered “The General Relativity Theory” if Einstein had not done so. I’ve watched some of his lectures & interviews online and i was very impressed, which is why i’ve decided to invest my money & time in buying and reading one of his books. I have to be honest and say that the book is not as easy to understand as one might think. It is not for those that have no physics background at all. I had difficulties when Feynman talked about basic physics and chemistry facts, it was too dry & somehow really complicated. It was not easy to follow up and to understand the content. But, maybe, i lack the minimum knowledge one must have in order to start listening to a great scientist like Feynman in the first place, that is a very good argument indeed. On the contrary, there’re beautiful examples in this book. His ways of explaining complex subjects with simple examples is phenomenal. - Moe xx..."

I was completely lost at some point after the atomic deep dive though, but for good reason according to Feynman, for “Things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale.” and we have to use our imagination when it comes to the quantum. I’m more interested to see how physics can be stretched to philosophy like the incessant movement of atoms and how our body is continually changing even if there are no outward manifestations.I added this book to my reading list after Naval cited it in a podcast I was listening to, walking towards City Super buying a perk me up afternoon drink.***Quotes:What looks like a dead, uninteresting thing — a glass of water with a cover, that has been sitting there for perhaps twenty years — really contains a dynamic and interesting phenomenon which is going on all the time.

Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces speaks about six basic topics involved in Physics in a good, enjoyable and yes in a basic yet comprehensive way. The first chapter describes atoms in detailed, their functionality. The second and the third chapter describe physics and its relation to other sciences, good stuff. To be honest, I think the fourth (Conservation of Energy), fifth (The Theory of Gravitation) and sixth (Quantum Behavior - undoubtedly the heart of the book) were the best chapters in the book. I will not go into details as I don't want my review to be a complete spoiler.Just about the last chapter - It speaks and describes ""The Double Slit"" experiment beautifully like I have never understood it before, very detailed. This one chapter is undoubtedly the gem of the book.I'd definitely recommend this book to starters in Physics as well as to the experienced people in Physics (though you'd have known most of it - you can enjoy Feynman's deep insights).I am looking forward to getting hold of Six not-so Easy Pieces but not anytime soon..."

Accessible does not mean easy, and the book finds a delicate balance to discuss the complex topics+ Very well written or lectured. This was an enjoyable read start to finish as I enjoy Feynman's unique way of explaining things. + Honest and sincere. Where we haven't explored theory enough Feynman will quickly conclude ""we don't know"" and ""we must then find out""Cons- Definitely have to be interested in the topic (duh) but this isn't a book to take a risk on. If physics and the way our universe works is not interesting to you, you will get lost in this book and be unable to follow along- the first half of the book is the real ""easy"" bit and therefore it's critical to consider what easy really means. In this context, easy for students of physics at university level. - very minor gripe, but the formatting of the book. Feynman will discuss topics and the related figure or diagram won't be until the next page; frustrating if you're genuinely interested in pursuing this as a learning resource."

If you're expecting the jovial, self-aggrandizing Feynman of ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character, you're not going to get him here. This is Professor Feynman cleaned up for the classroom, and cleaned up further for mass ""respectable"" publication.The most illuminating part of this book was by far the quantum mechanics chapter, followed by the very basic chapters on basic molecular structure and physical states. Weirdly, the most obtuse chapters for me were on basic principles of force and energy. The diagrams did nothing for me there. I think a static medium of printed words and diagrams is maybe not the best for that subject."
568,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115451775-melvin,5,"This was a great book to read. I read it about three or four years ago as I started to become interested in physics. I had had it recommended to me via a Youtube video by Simon Clark. Anyway, I read it while on vacation and it was really, really good. It presents physics in a way that makes it easy to understand without hiding the details. I must admit that some parts were a little hard to understand and concepts were harder to grasp at some parts of the book. I think this is mainly due to my then younger age and the fact that I am a non-native speaker. I do still recommend it to everyone though. The book is perfect for anyone who thinks that they might enjoy physics and wants a first glance over the concepts. It introduces the concepts of basic principles such as conservation of energy all the way to more modern, advanced concepts such as quantum physics (although briefly and graspable). This book has been really important to me. I've only read it once, but the thought concepts presented in that book has been with me ever since I read it and helped me a lot in school to understand new concepts."
569,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67149971-elizabeth-saunders,3,"	In reading the book, ""Six Easy Pieces"" by Richard Feynman, there was one primary thing that I noticed. I consider myself to be a little bit more of a history or math oriented person, and I am even more confident about that now after reading the book. Not to say that the book didn't do a good job of simplifying some of Feynman's key points in physics- I believe it does just that. I understand that I am not part of the ""target audience"" from the book, which is why I feel like I didn't retain a whole lot of the more complicated parts. 	The lectures were definitely geared for the top tier science students. Also, at times, I found it a tad difficult to maintain a consistent level of interest through the passages with more data-heavy detail, as you might expect from a science lecture book. As a whole, though, I would say the book was very informative and an interesting read throughout. My feelings for Physics haven't changed, but at least I understand a little better about what the science of Physics actually is. -Duncan Hicks"

Mr Feynman's arguably legendary way of explaining physics is enjoyably succinct, my only complaint would be that I felt it could have been a bit more detailed, say with the inclusion of more equations while still taking into account the introductory theme of this book. However, this is it and those who wish to know more will certainly take a look at the Lectures themselves.Highly recommended to everyone who is interested in an introduction to physics in general - this is a light read and Mr Feynman is indeed a special person to teach us! However, if you do already have a gist of the basics, a more detailed book might be a better option for you. It is still a worthy read though, because there is some magic to 
how
 Mr Feynman explains physics, uses associations and makes physics intelligible."
571,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5676383-krishna-sundarram,4,"Feynman gave a series of lectures to first year students in the 1960s and the ones in this book are the 6 easiest topics. I was already familiar with these because I elected to study physics in school, so what I really after was understanding what made Feynman such a good teacher. After all, I had been taught the same matter by different teachers, some of whom taught in the conventional way, one of whom was heavily inspired by Feynman (shoutout to Prof Raavi!) and had also read 2-3 different texts on my own. So I hoped that I'd be able to contrast their approach to Feynman's and see if I could learn the techniques that made Feynman such a great teacher.Sadly, I couldn't. I know nothing more about teaching than I did before I started reading this (I didn't know much to begin with). That's not to say I got nothing out of it. I have a better intuitive grasp of escape velocity (should come in handy if I ever play Kerbal Space Program) and I finally understand the significance of the double slit experiment and the Uncertainty Principle. Its a fun read, even if you're already familiar with the matter.I still think its possible to become a great teacher by reading all the lectures repeatedly. Someday, I might look into that."
572,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45118733-eduardo-montiel,4,"Interesting read, the examples where a bit more complicated than expected. However, I have terrible spatial intelligence in order to accurately visualize them. My favorite section was where Feynman describes the relationship between physics and other branches of science: chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy, and even psychology. All these fields can be described in terms of physics and he goes through the main findings of each field and how they advanced different areas of scientific research in terms of physics. It was really helpful for mental filing. Especially since he separates the categories. The examples on energy and the uncertainty principle were particularly difficult for me to visualize. However, the examples are a bit clearer when Feynman starts to summarize and synthesize the points at the end of the chapters. I would have liked a bit more information on relativity, apart from the tie in to gravitation and the speed of light. The uncertainty principle is fascinating, but I’ve read easier interpretations on the subject. "

Feynman does a great job of not getting lost in the weeds of mathematical proofs and uses examples that people can understand to help us comprehend phenomena that are difficult to wrap our heads around because the aren't observable. This is a great introductory series of lectures, I have listened to them a few times now and it has really helped me get a better grasp on several basic physics concepts. Definitely recommend this to anyone interested in physics that doesn't have a post-secondary education in physics (otherwise this will be review, which could also be beneficial) if you do have post-secondary background in physics then ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"" which encompass these ones but also go much further might be a better choice, this may just leaving you thirsting for more which the complete set may be able to quench."
574,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,5,"In particle physics, there is an elementary sub-atomic particle called neutrino with zero mass. But what does it mean for a natural object to have zero mass? In order to answer this question one needs to first understand what mass is and what it abstracts. On the one hand, mass represents a property of a natural object within the context of the space-time continuum; a kind of constant that determines the strength of attraction of an object in the presence of a gravitational field (or another mass). On the other hand, we have the uncertainty principle that stipulates inherent uncertainty in the simultaneous knowledge of location and speed; and thus, if an object has zero mass it then means its location is absolutely unknown and therefore it must always be moving. Thus, if an object has zero mass then it can never be at rest.Feynman uses these kinds of questions to explain things we tend to incorrectly assume to be obvious. It is in those questions where the essential knowledge lies."

Professor Feynman is careful to elucidate all the shortcomings of our knowledge, leaving many doors wide open for discovery and new information to guide what we know to be true.A short read, yet very dense as he weaves the tale of how important physics really is. I took three physics classes in high school and two in college, yet I feel like I am learning all these things for the first time. Feynman has this wonderful way of helping you see what is going on, to understand something rather than just be able to name it. The final chapter began to stretch my ability to follow his explanations, but I feel as though I now have a better basis for quantum mechanics (no matter how minuscule it may actually be). I hope to return to this book periodically as we discover more and more, to reflect on what he/we knew then compared to now and the future."

Really inspiring stuff from this point of view.But, as someone also interested in the actual content of the book, it was a great read. I've given it 3 stars simply because I was too ignorant of the basics to actually make any real sense of the chemistry parts of the book and much of the mathematical stuff."

It is really interesting!!!If you want to read this book, please just keep in mind that its chapters are extracted from the first volume of Feynman lectures on Physics ( that has 3 volumes and 52 chapters just in the first one ), and from different spots. So for example, in the last chapter "" Quantum Behavior "", I had to explain some technical words and/or watch some Youtube videos to get the idea and be able to understand what the author is saying. And that's because sometimes he referred to chapters that I haven't read yet or used some words that I didn't understand. But I think that it's a great way to start!Anyways, it is indeed a wonderful book. But if you are unfamiliar with physics, don't feel bad for reading a paragraph more than once and defining words that you don't understand.

It is, after all, an abridged version of lectures given to university level physics students, and Feynman thus assumes some understanding of advanced maths and some scientific principles. This can make it occasionally impenetrable for the average reader. For the most part, however, Feynman's explanations are enchantingly lucid and occasionally even poetic, and the reader is sure to come away understanding just a little bit more about how the laws of the universe work, even if baffled by the formulas. I certainly did. It might even make you believe in a higher power - though not necessarily in any religious sense. I found myself awed by some of the truths Feynman uncovered, and the explanations (or lack of them) that he provided. This is certainly a brilliant primer for anyone looking to understand something about physics."

(Oh, how I wish he could have had access to what we have available today! If he could've studied Hubble images! ) As stated in the preface, Feynman wondered if there was a way to expose undergraduate students of physics with the excitement of the frontier instead of boring them for their first two years. He wondered why if there was way to bring the excitement of relativity and quantum mechanics to incoming freshman. His experiment, these lectures, was a failure, in his opinion, but someone had to try. I loved reading these and will definitely incorporate some of these connections into my own teaching. My favorite quote, from page 103,""That the law of gravitation is true even at bigger distances is indicated in Fig. 5-8. If one cannot see gravitation acting here, he has no soul."""

But, don't be fooled by how easy things look in the book. In the real world, the ones who attended these lectures were not beginners who want to learn Physics. It was his peers and Graduates who wanted to get his perspective. That's his speciality. You know how Chemistry works and how we smell. But, when he explains the concept, we can visualize everything in a completely different way. The last chapter about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle was the best of the lot. I am pretty sure that even if I wanted to , I can never forget how Quantum Mechanics originated. The real life ELI5. Worth reading it again and again till you understand.

The chapter on quantum physics gives one of the best explanations of the process, not trivial and some knowledge of imaginary numbers would be useful too, but still one of the best pieces explaining whats going on down there. Still to figure out/review, relationship of the Schrodinger's cat paradox and the uncertainty principle, the uncertainty principle at a macroscopic level, imaginary numbers, try to start observations on planetary orbits and figure out the math behind to compute trajectories, speed, mass, etc. Review the math behind pulleys and other simple machines.

All reports of him being an excellent lecturer ring true.I tried to think about how to review this for non-scientists. This is a selection of six chapters chosen from the larger set of Feynman lectures - seemingly chosen for relative simplicity. But they're all over the place. I didn't remember there being a discussion of biology in one, and the quantum mechanics piece is (as they admit) more complex than the rest. I will admit, though, some of his double-slit experiment discussion was freshly insightful to me.I can't get it out of my head how these lectures succeeded and failed simultaneously. It felt like he just went up there and (in a clear and interesting way) talked. As a window into his thinking, it's interesting. I couldn't picture these pieces being a coherent part of a class."

That doesn't mean his wit and enthusiasm don't come across in these lectures, and the photographs of him teaching practically vibrate with his excitement. As one of the critics of Feynman's lectures on physics wrote, reading his lectures ""is like trying to drink from a fire hose."" Still, just because it's hard work, and because they're are portions of the book where I needed more explanation, doesn't mean that there isn't something exhilarating about going through the very start of physics with the best American physicist of the twentieth century as a guide. There's also something to be said for getting something of a glimpse into real brilliance. I learned some physics, though I've learned more from other authors, but this was more exciting."

It is easily understandable for who is familiar with the most concepts of science and physics in particular, but there are no great barriers for those who just don't have some primary base concepts. That's because Feynman writes not just about science, but about the humans behind it.And in doing so he manages to take out science from - literally - a glass of water.And this is the ability of a wise and valuable man, not just that of a super clever scientist (even if in this case both the two option corresponds to him and describe him).I advise everyone flow in the magnificent World Feynman is able to describe: it is just about some Beauty that can not be unrevealed.

The diagrams are a bit outdated, but that is to be expected from a book that pulls its body from lectures that took place in the 1960s. While the introductory chapter does a great job, it is quickly undone midway through chapter two. However, I encourage readers to trudge on as the book does recover slowly in chapters three and four before ultimately redeeming itself in chapters five and six. As stated in the books introduction, this work is targeted toward a selected audience, that audience being those that are truly interested in pursuing physics and/or other sciences. This is not something you would want to read if you're just looking to dabble. This book has encouraged me to check out the Feynman lectures in their entirety."

Like many incredibly intelligent people, he can often present ideas as obvious when a mere mortal like me cannot immediately grab them.As university lectures, these six easy pieces do create a foundation but I found often it was too high level and had to be taken on faith. Surprisingly, I found his description of quantum physics to be the most accessible of the six pieces taking very complex ideas and explaining them as well as illuminating the reasons for fundamental doubt. Frustratingly, he refers to future lectures which do not appear in the book.It is however a valuable publication showing a viewpoint drawn from extreme intellect."

Though it is adviced to have at least high school level knowledge of maths, physics and chemistry. Otherwise it might seem like he's going too fast through certain topics. It's usefull to be comfortable with these subjects. Especially around the final two chapters when he gets into the good stuff (law of gravitation and quantum mechanics).Overall I'd recommend this book to anyone curious enough to get a basic view of the world from a physics perspective without all the technical jargon (though it has some. But they're properly explained) and maths. This is a must read for aspiring STEM majors."

It covers physics without resorting to mathematical formulae. This is the strength of Dr Feynmans knack for breaking things down and explaining it in the easiest terms possible for the audience. This definitely sparked the imagination and made me want to learn more. However, the lack of math is also this books weakness. Six easy pieces are taken from lectures and some of them presuppose previous knowledge that the reader might not necessarily have. At times I felt that I needed that extra bit of math with couple easy problems to solve myself to grasp the concepts a little quicker. If you are interested in science and thinking of pursuing physics this book would get my wholehearted recommendation."

Reading the first chapter of Six Easy Pieces guided my decision making and I shortly enrolled myself into a science and engineering program. I revisited this book recently after recommending it to my girlfriend (a liberal arts student aspiring to switch to science) and realized how foundational the writing in this book is to anyone wanting to understand science. To the kids of the future, this should be made essential reading to grok that science is not about memorization and solving equations but about reasoning first principles.

However, there are other parts where one perceives it shows a bit of its age. For example, the quantum physics part doesn't mention the Standard Model nor its problem (obviously since the standard model is from the 70s). But again, this is a brilliant piece and very easy to read."

It provides an intuitive approach to the physic, very useful especially to understand the gravitational theory, demonstrating that with logic and reasoning it is possible to deduct the very basic pillar of the physic without recurring to formulas and equations (actually there are few equations here and there, but no rocket science involved).I will keep it on my shelf and I will read it again now and then as a refresher. "
592,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18211158-sughanthan,3,"This is a good book to create basic intuition for some physics principles. But I would have liked a little more clarifications on certain things. At various points in the book, I felt like I could use a little more explanation. In any case, if you would like to learn basic intuition of how atoms work, how quantum mechanics came to be, or what the uncertainty principle is, this is the book for you. Some intuitions and images that are talked about in the book are very useful in visualizing the concepts. The next day after I read this book, I saw water vapor and I started thinking about how heat is causing the molecules to bounce from the surface of water. "

By really difficult I mean it's practically impossible to imagine all the things that should happen when an experiment is done. It's better to watch this somewhere instead of reading it. That's why I though some of the lectures in this book are better to be done in a video format.Other than that, I learned quite a few things throughout the book so there were parts I enjoyed a lot. Just a book is not the ideal format for these lectures, in my opinion."

As I'm not very proficient in physics, the ""easy"" pieces weren't that easy to understand. The beginning with everything made of atoms is still mostly clear, but the end doesn't help much with the understanding of quantum mechanics, even with Feynman's good explanation style. I guess there is no shortcut to learning physics seriously if you're on that path. :)"

This book represents six of the ""easiest"" chapters of those lectures, covering atoms, basic physics, the relation of physics to other sciences, conservation of energy, gravitational theory, and an introduction to quantum mechanics. Feynman uses great analogies and examples to make the material accessible, but it was probably still good that I remembered some of my basic science heading into this."

If you read the book, buy the paper copy!With a MS in engineering I found much of what the book said to be a repeat of my college courses. In a few cases, where that was not the case, I could not decipher the related illustrations and was left somewhat in the dark. Potentially a good book for those that have an interest in this field.

With that said, physics boasts a long history of some of the most interesting scientists, and Feynman is a personal favorite. I had already read a few books about Feynman himself, and thought it would be worthwhile to read from these famous lectures of his. Of course, if what's said is true, the man was a performer in front of a classroom, and little justice can be done from simply reading his lectures. It was still nice to get a small glimpse into his teaching style. "

I quite enjoyed this, the only problem was that it was first published in 1963, which means some of the information in the book was a little out of date or behind the modern standards. There were also a number of references to 'recent discoveries' which were, of course, from the late 50s and early 60s, which held little interest for me at all. However, certainly in its day it would have been a brilliant book, and that it still mostly holds up now is a testament to Feynman."

I really enjoyed Richard's descriptions as several were not ones that I'd heard before. A few places got a bit dense even for me but this was a really enjoyable book. It's a little deep for the casual reader but still worthwhile especially the first half of the book. Feyman was a remarkable man.

609,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

While the title says ""easy"" - it is keeping in mind that these were lectures for the best and brightest at Caltech...so yes, while they are not overly complex, they are also not designed for the novice either. Five of the lectures cover concepts in classical physics (energy, gravitation etc) and the role of physics in society. However, it is the final chapter on quantum which is the gold mine in this book (especially regarding the Uncertainty Principle).I am a massive Feynman fan and he is widely notes as one of the best (and most engaging) physics teachers of the 20th century and while this book was good and definitely worth picking up, I am not sure whether I would call it great as some of the magic of Feynman just didn't translate as well as I was hoping to the written page. Well worth the read."
612,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46917424-rami,5,"The way that Feynman goes by explaining the topics of this book reminded me of Stephen Hawking's books about the universe. I did enjoy the analogies the author uses to explain some principles that are not always easy to grasp, particularly about our our knowledge of the laws discussed.I found myself discovering new ideas and seeing things from a new perspective even after several years in engineering, having already read and studies most of the content of this book before, but never from this angle.Would definitely recommend it as an entry point to people who want more insight into modern day physics."
613,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094533-mary-overton,0,"Lectures from a series given at Caltech in the early 60s - intended for freshmen, to stimulate their interest in physics. Special Preface: ""Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that's not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered students started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience."" pp. xxii-xxiii""'Quantum mechanics' is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."" pg. 116""Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience."" pg. 117 ""We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics....We can only predict the odds!.... We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."" pg. 135"
614,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30489708-alcatraz-dey,4,"This book is a brilliant way to broaden your knowledge of the key concepts of physics. Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."
615,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"This book is an introduction to the most basic ideas of physics, and part of its sophistication is that it hints at how deep the...rabbit hole...is, without requiring readers to have enough expertise to really go down it.It was readable but challenging for me - someone with a bachelor's in biology and no great adeptitude for physics or math. My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
616,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
617,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."
618,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"Non-fiction. This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."
619,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336491-laura,2,"I may be one of the few scientists who is not a Feynman fan. He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."

A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."
621,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4333246-lauren,5,"Feynman never ceases to amaze me with his genuine ability to take a complicated subject (or concept) and make it accessible to the masses. After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe. If you want a book that will truly keep you on your toes and thinking, pick this one up. "

This epitome of that masterwork really does offer an easy guide to what physics, and science in general, is all about. Feynman explores the most fundamental scientific theories that all intelligent people should be aware of – the structure and behaviour of atoms, quantum mechanics and gravity. These are the fundamentals that ought to be as well known as Shakespeare, Mozart and Picasso. The material is essentially a transcript of Feynman lecturing (you can even get the lectures themselves on a CD to accompany the book), and comes across like a wise friend giving you the inside story on a subject he loves."

In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

The departments for both at my school were fairly challenging and I wasn’t particularly good at them and so I shied away for fear they would hurt my GPA.As it turns out, no one has ever asked to see my GPA and I would have been better off taking the classes, getting Cs and learning a lot. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book. Feynman is an astoundingly good teacher, with a real facility for metaphors and analogies that make the subject matter easy to grasp."

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

He had a lively mind and spirit that helped him connect to the kids. Hell, he was a kid, just with an oversized brain. He believed that if physics was so great, so cool, so awesome that it should be understandable by the many not the few. Therefore, he tried to teach it in pictures or models rather than math. He failed but, he was one cool, smart dude for thinking this way. Want to see this question explored more? Read my book, Black Body Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe.

Richard Feynman inspired people around the world with his scientific brilliance, endless curiosity about the world and unorthodox outlook on life. Here he guides the reader through the very basics of physics, including atoms, energy, force, the relation of physics to other sciences, the theory of gravitation and quantum behaviour. Presenting complex ideas in simplified, understandable terms and using illustrations such as shooting bullets, waves on a seashore and even Dennis the Menace's building blocks, Six Easy Pieces gets to the heart of how the world works."

Could even be zero. I'm uncertain about how I feel, truly). Six ""Easy"" Pieces is definitely not as easy as you would expect. The first 3 chapters were outstandingly brilliant and easy to catch. The following two were outstandingly brilliant too, but a bit harder. And then came the quantum mechanics chapter. Which left my head's angular momentum uncertain. :3My recommendation: 10/10 for physics people, 6/10 for laymen."

Many college professors should read Feynman, as they may learn about the performance of teaching. Just because you are intelligent doesn't mean you have to make difficult concepts overly complicated. That is the true genius of Feynman. He was able to take incredibly difficult concepts and explain them in a way that was fun, informative and entertaining. The mark of a true genius and a unique and rare teacher."
630,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39755297-fipah,4," 4 stars = I really liked it A quick and easy read that introduces the reader to selected 6 topics that span a wide range of themes in physics, hence they really work as an introduction only. Mr Feynman's arguably legendary way of explaining physics is enjoyably succinct, my only complaint would be that I felt it could have been a bit more detailed, say with the inclusion of more equations while still taking into account the introductory theme of this book. However, this is it and those who wish to know more will certainly take a look at the Lectures themselves.Highly recommended to everyone who is interested in an introduction to physics in general - this is a light read and Mr Feynman is indeed a special person to teach us! However, if you do already have a gist of the basics, a more detailed book might be a better option for you. It is still a worthy read though, because there is some magic to 
how
 Mr Feynman explains physics, uses associations and makes physics intelligible."
631,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5676383-krishna-sundarram,4,"Feynman gave a series of lectures to first year students in the 1960s and the ones in this book are the 6 easiest topics. I was already familiar with these because I elected to study physics in school, so what I really after was understanding what made Feynman such a good teacher. After all, I had been taught the same matter by different teachers, some of whom taught in the conventional way, one of whom was heavily inspired by Feynman (shoutout to Prof Raavi!) and had also read 2-3 different texts on my own. So I hoped that I'd be able to contrast their approach to Feynman's and see if I could learn the techniques that made Feynman such a great teacher.Sadly, I couldn't. I know nothing more about teaching than I did before I started reading this (I didn't know much to begin with). That's not to say I got nothing out of it. I have a better intuitive grasp of escape velocity (should come in handy if I ever play Kerbal Space Program) and I finally understand the significance of the double slit experiment and the Uncertainty Principle. Its a fun read, even if you're already familiar with the matter.I still think its possible to become a great teacher by reading all the lectures repeatedly. Someday, I might look into that."
632,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45118733-eduardo-montiel,4,"Interesting read, the examples where a bit more complicated than expected. However, I have terrible spatial intelligence in order to accurately visualize them. My favorite section was where Feynman describes the relationship between physics and other branches of science: chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy, and even psychology. All these fields can be described in terms of physics and he goes through the main findings of each field and how they advanced different areas of scientific research in terms of physics. It was really helpful for mental filing. Especially since he separates the categories. The examples on energy and the uncertainty principle were particularly difficult for me to visualize. However, the examples are a bit clearer when Feynman starts to summarize and synthesize the points at the end of the chapters. I would have liked a bit more information on relativity, apart from the tie in to gravitation and the speed of light. The uncertainty principle is fascinating, but I’ve read easier interpretations on the subject. "
633,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82482793-matthew-grenier,4,"The first lecture is almost unlistenable at points with the quality being so poor but the subsequent 4 were pretty good and easily understood (from a pure audio perspective, not related to content).Quality of audio aside, this was very informative. Feynman does a great job of not getting lost in the weeds of mathematical proofs and uses examples that people can understand to help us comprehend phenomena that are difficult to wrap our heads around because the aren't observable. This is a great introductory series of lectures, I have listened to them a few times now and it has really helped me get a better grasp on several basic physics concepts. Definitely recommend this to anyone interested in physics that doesn't have a post-secondary education in physics (otherwise this will be review, which could also be beneficial) if you do have post-secondary background in physics then ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"" which encompass these ones but also go much further might be a better choice, this may just leaving you thirsting for more which the complete set may be able to quench."
634,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,5,"In particle physics, there is an elementary sub-atomic particle called neutrino with zero mass. But what does it mean for a natural object to have zero mass? In order to answer this question one needs to first understand what mass is and what it abstracts. On the one hand, mass represents a property of a natural object within the context of the space-time continuum; a kind of constant that determines the strength of attraction of an object in the presence of a gravitational field (or another mass). On the other hand, we have the uncertainty principle that stipulates inherent uncertainty in the simultaneous knowledge of location and speed; and thus, if an object has zero mass it then means its location is absolutely unknown and therefore it must always be moving. Thus, if an object has zero mass then it can never be at rest.Feynman uses these kinds of questions to explain things we tend to incorrectly assume to be obvious. It is in those questions where the essential knowledge lies."
635,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70500211-michael,5,"The physics course I wish I had the pleasure to take. Professor Feynman is careful to elucidate all the shortcomings of our knowledge, leaving many doors wide open for discovery and new information to guide what we know to be true.A short read, yet very dense as he weaves the tale of how important physics really is. I took three physics classes in high school and two in college, yet I feel like I am learning all these things for the first time. Feynman has this wonderful way of helping you see what is going on, to understand something rather than just be able to name it. The final chapter began to stretch my ability to follow his explanations, but I feel as though I now have a better basis for quantum mechanics (no matter how minuscule it may actually be). I hope to return to this book periodically as we discover more and more, to reflect on what he/we knew then compared to now and the future."

Really inspiring stuff from this point of view.But, as someone also interested in the actual content of the book, it was a great read. I've given it 3 stars simply because I was too ignorant of the basics to actually make any real sense of the chemistry parts of the book and much of the mathematical stuff."
637,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96185483-haytam,5,"This book is a great introduction to the world of physics!! It is really interesting!!!If you want to read this book, please just keep in mind that its chapters are extracted from the first volume of Feynman lectures on Physics ( that has 3 volumes and 52 chapters just in the first one ), and from different spots. So for example, in the last chapter "" Quantum Behavior "", I had to explain some technical words and/or watch some Youtube videos to get the idea and be able to understand what the author is saying. And that's because sometimes he referred to chapters that I haven't read yet or used some words that I didn't understand. But I think that it's a great way to start!Anyways, it is indeed a wonderful book. But if you are unfamiliar with physics, don't feel bad for reading a paragraph more than once and defining words that you don't understand. When you'll keep building your understanding slowly, you'll definitely ENJOY the book and be AMAZED by its content!"
638,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77962764-ishan,4,"Billed as a layman's guide, but more complicated than that in reality. It is, after all, an abridged version of lectures given to university level physics students, and Feynman thus assumes some understanding of advanced maths and some scientific principles. This can make it occasionally impenetrable for the average reader. For the most part, however, Feynman's explanations are enchantingly lucid and occasionally even poetic, and the reader is sure to come away understanding just a little bit more about how the laws of the universe work, even if baffled by the formulas. I certainly did. It might even make you believe in a higher power - though not necessarily in any religious sense. I found myself awed by some of the truths Feynman uncovered, and the explanations (or lack of them) that he provided. This is certainly a brilliant primer for anyone looking to understand something about physics."
639,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2539789-lisa-manske,5,"As always, Feynman is a delight. I thoroughly enjoyed this ""conversation"" with theoretical physics of the 1960s. (Oh, how I wish he could have had access to what we have available today! If he could've studied Hubble images! ) As stated in the preface, Feynman wondered if there was a way to expose undergraduate students of physics with the excitement of the frontier instead of boring them for their first two years. He wondered why if there was way to bring the excitement of relativity and quantum mechanics to incoming freshman. His experiment, these lectures, was a failure, in his opinion, but someone had to try. I loved reading these and will definitely incorporate some of these connections into my own teaching. My favorite quote, from page 103,""That the law of gravitation is true even at bigger distances is indicated in Fig. 5-8. If one cannot see gravitation acting here, he has no soul."""

But, don't be fooled by how easy things look in the book. In the real world, the ones who attended these lectures were not beginners who want to learn Physics. It was his peers and Graduates who wanted to get his perspective. That's his speciality. You know how Chemistry works and how we smell. But, when he explains the concept, we can visualize everything in a completely different way. The last chapter about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle was the best of the lot. I am pretty sure that even if I wanted to , I can never forget how Quantum Mechanics originated. The real life ELI5. Worth reading it again and again till you understand. But, you can ignore Chapter 3 a little bit. Missed his magic there. Overall, what do you care what other people think ? ;)"

His description of the principle of conservation of energy and its relationship to potential/kinetic/electromagnetic attraction computation is beautiful. The chapter on quantum physics gives one of the best explanations of the process, not trivial and some knowledge of imaginary numbers would be useful too, but still one of the best pieces explaining whats going on down there. Still to figure out/review, relationship of the Schrodinger's cat paradox and the uncertainty principle, the uncertainty principle at a macroscopic level, imaginary numbers, try to start observations on planetary orbits and figure out the math behind to compute trajectories, speed, mass, etc. Review the math behind pulleys and other simple machines.

All reports of him being an excellent lecturer ring true.I tried to think about how to review this for non-scientists. This is a selection of six chapters chosen from the larger set of Feynman lectures - seemingly chosen for relative simplicity. But they're all over the place. I didn't remember there being a discussion of biology in one, and the quantum mechanics piece is (as they admit) more complex than the rest. I will admit, though, some of his double-slit experiment discussion was freshly insightful to me.I can't get it out of my head how these lectures succeeded and failed simultaneously. It felt like he just went up there and (in a clear and interesting way) talked. As a window into his thinking, it's interesting. I couldn't picture these pieces being a coherent part of a class."
643,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5126957-ted-young,4,"The title is misleading. The pieces are not easy, and Feynman considered his attempt to teach undergraduates a failure. That doesn't mean his wit and enthusiasm don't come across in these lectures, and the photographs of him teaching practically vibrate with his excitement. As one of the critics of Feynman's lectures on physics wrote, reading his lectures ""is like trying to drink from a fire hose."" Still, just because it's hard work, and because they're are portions of the book where I needed more explanation, doesn't mean that there isn't something exhilarating about going through the very start of physics with the best American physicist of the twentieth century as a guide. There's also something to be said for getting something of a glimpse into real brilliance. I learned some physics, though I've learned more from other authors, but this was more exciting."
644,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88199233-rick,4,"A really good introduction to physics throughout the particular, original and unique style of R.P. Feynman. It is easily understandable for who is familiar with the most concepts of science and physics in particular, but there are no great barriers for those who just don't have some primary base concepts. That's because Feynman writes not just about science, but about the humans behind it.And in doing so he manages to take out science from - literally - a glass of water.And this is the ability of a wise and valuable man, not just that of a super clever scientist (even if in this case both the two option corresponds to him and describe him).I advise everyone flow in the magnificent World Feynman is able to describe: it is just about some Beauty that can not be unrevealed. Everyone should know how wonderful is the world around us. Let YOU be free to get to know it."
645,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69411959-aaron,4,"Feynman's gift for explaining complex physics in a simple & entertaining way is on display with this fairly quick read. The diagrams are a bit outdated, but that is to be expected from a book that pulls its body from lectures that took place in the 1960s. While the introductory chapter does a great job, it is quickly undone midway through chapter two. However, I encourage readers to trudge on as the book does recover slowly in chapters three and four before ultimately redeeming itself in chapters five and six. As stated in the books introduction, this work is targeted toward a selected audience, that audience being those that are truly interested in pursuing physics and/or other sciences. This is not something you would want to read if you're just looking to dabble. This book has encouraged me to check out the Feynman lectures in their entirety."
646,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49435353-john-s,3,"""Easy"" is a subjective term. There is no doubt about Feynman's depth of knowledge and willingness to explain ideas. Like many incredibly intelligent people, he can often present ideas as obvious when a mere mortal like me cannot immediately grab them.As university lectures, these six easy pieces do create a foundation but I found often it was too high level and had to be taken on faith. Surprisingly, I found his description of quantum physics to be the most accessible of the six pieces taking very complex ideas and explaining them as well as illuminating the reasons for fundamental doubt. Frustratingly, he refers to future lectures which do not appear in the book.It is however a valuable publication showing a viewpoint drawn from extreme intellect."
647,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58618743-nazir,5,"Amazing, clear and concise book to introduce some of the pure physics concepts to the common reader. Though it is adviced to have at least high school level knowledge of maths, physics and chemistry. Otherwise it might seem like he's going too fast through certain topics. It's usefull to be comfortable with these subjects. Especially around the final two chapters when he gets into the good stuff (law of gravitation and quantum mechanics).Overall I'd recommend this book to anyone curious enough to get a basic view of the world from a physics perspective without all the technical jargon (though it has some. But they're properly explained) and maths. This is a must read for aspiring STEM majors."
648,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38008473-odyssey,4,"I feel that this book straddles the line between popular science and a physics lesson. It covers physics without resorting to mathematical formulae. This is the strength of Dr Feynmans knack for breaking things down and explaining it in the easiest terms possible for the audience. This definitely sparked the imagination and made me want to learn more. However, the lack of math is also this books weakness. Six easy pieces are taken from lectures and some of them presuppose previous knowledge that the reader might not necessarily have. At times I felt that I needed that extra bit of math with couple easy problems to solve myself to grasp the concepts a little quicker. If you are interested in science and thinking of pursuing physics this book would get my wholehearted recommendation."

Reading the first chapter of Six Easy Pieces guided my decision making and I shortly enrolled myself into a science and engineering program. I revisited this book recently after recommending it to my girlfriend (a liberal arts student aspiring to switch to science) and realized how foundational the writing in this book is to anyone wanting to understand science. To the kids of the future, this should be made essential reading to grok that science is not about memorization and solving equations but about reasoning first principles. Richard Feynman is the greatest teacher and then a Nobel Laureate."

It attempts to present Physics in an intuitive way, with little or no maths involved. It contains great pieces of intuition (the conservation of energy and its applications are brilliant, and the linking of physics with other disciplines is superb). However, there are other parts where one perceives it shows a bit of its age. For example, the quantum physics part doesn't mention the Standard Model nor its problem (obviously since the standard model is from the 70s). But again, this is a brilliant piece and very easy to read."

It provides an intuitive approach to the physic, very useful especially to understand the gravitational theory, demonstrating that with logic and reasoning it is possible to deduct the very basic pillar of the physic without recurring to formulas and equations (actually there are few equations here and there, but no rocket science involved).I will keep it on my shelf and I will read it again now and then as a refresher.

In any case, if you would like to learn basic intuition of how atoms work, how quantum mechanics came to be, or what the uncertainty principle is, this is the book for you. Some intuitions and images that are talked about in the book are very useful in visualizing the concepts.

By really difficult I mean it's practically impossible to imagine all the things that should happen when an experiment is done. It's better to watch this somewhere instead of reading it. That's why I though some of the lectures in this book are better to be done in a video format.Other than that, I learned quite a few things throughout the book so there were parts I enjoyed a lot. Just a book is not the ideal format for these lectures, in my opinion."

With that said, physics boasts a long history of some of the most interesting scientists, and Feynman is a personal favorite. I had already read a few books about Feynman himself, and thought it would be worthwhile to read from these famous lectures of his. Of course, if what's said is true, the man was a performer in front of a classroom, and little justice can be done from simply reading his lectures. It was still nice to get a small glimpse into his teaching style. "

I quite enjoyed this, the only problem was that it was first published in 1963, which means some of the information in the book was a little out of date or behind the modern standards. There were also a number of references to 'recent discoveries' which were, of course, from the late 50s and early 60s, which held little interest for me at all. However, certainly in its day it would have been a brilliant book, and that it still mostly holds up now is a testament to Feynman."

673,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6470362-jean-tessier,5,"I while back, I bought a book that introduced math topics to the lay person. This looked like it could do the same for physics. And by none other than Richard Feynman himself.Feynman goes for a more intuitive approach and avoids any complex mathematics. His explanations and examples are strikingly clear. The jiggling of atoms explain the difference between solid, liquid, and gaseous states. Changing arrangements explain chemical reactions, like burning carbon. Everything is made out of atoms, with patterns that defy the imagination.I struggled through the chapter on the conservation of energy. One take-away is that we can explain limits in nature using reversible machines, even though there are no reversible machines in nature. The chapters on gravitation and quantum mechanics were exceedingly clear. The chapter on how physics relates to the other sciences was a lot of fun. So, too, the chapter on gravitation.Tycho Brahe had an idea that was different from anything proposed by the ancients [...] that to find something out, it is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophical arguments. (p. 90) Tycho Brahe took measurements, Kepler deduced laws from these measurements, Galileo figured out inertia, and Newton formulated the law of gravitation (which was later refined by Einstein).I really like how Feynman repeatedly states the limits of science. There are many things that we simply do not know. For now. There may be things we will never know, but many phenomena in the past were deemed inexplicable, only to be explained later.It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. (p. 71) the principle of inertia — if something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.) (p. 93) All we have done is to describe how the earth moves around the sun, but we have not said what makes it go. (p. 107) No one has since given any machinery. (p. 107) Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. (p. 116) Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. (p. 117) According to Feynman, the fact that there are things we do not know does not mean that we are ignorant. We can explain the limits of how things operate with great precision, even though we cannot explain why.About the conservation of energy:There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law -- it is exact so far as we know. (p. 69) As I was reading the book, I often found myself wondering how much progress we've made since it had been written. For instance, in last year's Outgrowing God, Richard Dawkins makes a case for complex chemistry inevitably leads to self-replicating molecules like RNA and DNA, and eventually living organisms.Feynman does not reduce everything to physics. He acknowledges that there are areas of human knowledge outside of science.If something is said not to be a science, it does not mean that there something wrong with it; it just means that it is not a science. (p. 47) "

I'm not a fan of the paper and the typeface size, and well to me, it takes away from the smooth flow of the much bigger pages of the original book.It just gives me a claustrophobic feeling.---I need those lectures with the pages extra three inches wider, and four inches taller!!---I was given the whole set, since i had trouble trying to find the original red hardcovers in good shape [they always seemed to be warped], and I found them somewhat rough going when I faced Heisenberg's Uncertainity Principle for the first time, I took a break... I took a break and tried again a while later....He was talking about calculating the orbit of one planet and I struggled in places.Anyways, i decided to take a break for a month or two, and i did exactly what Issac Newton did, i decided to reread things all over again, right from the beginning.I simply burned through the first 100-150 pages of the Feynman Lectures and enjoyed it.But i had two small moments where I realized i was rushing things, and decided, later... later...I couldn't have as much fun browsing Vol II because of the calculus, even though i had the math knowledge at the time, but not the introductory calculus-level university level EM, so browsing those early on, i realized i would face some struggles.[I actually spoke to someone once who went to Caltech in the 60s, and he said that he thought Feynman's Lectures were brutal. He couldn't remember his other textbooks, but i really appreciated his insight 20 years later]It really bums me out since Feynman's writing really is beautiful and deep, and i see a lot of slightly unhappy folks picking up this book and having a hard time with it.I totally sympathize, because i felt let down that my concentration didn't flow with the page as easily, as I thought it might with a neat little hardcover.All I can say is that lots of people who experienced the Lectures in the day, some people were frustrated, and some people were blown away, and some experienced both.----All i can say is that reread the book very slowly and patiently, or borrow a copy of Volume One of the full lectures at the library and browse through them, an read the first 30 pages.and please please please READ, Feynman's autobiography firstSurely You're Joking Mister Feynman [Part I]What Do You Care What Other People Think? [Part II]"
675,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"I read this for all the wrong reasons. It was short and I wanted one more book for the month, and I knew I could blitz through all the basic science blah. I blitzed, it wasn't basic, I learned nothing except that I was insufferable and needed to stop this obnoxious book-counting. Also, Feynman was inappropriate and a irrascible, didn't knew. The writing is easy, likeable, and clear, I really wish I'd been able to sit in on one of his lectures, those must have been incredible. But I guess I had the next best thing, Bharatidasan kicking me out for the 10th time in a week because I wasn't adequately spellbound by his reading out from the illustrated guide to the simplified extract of Indian transliteration to the official university textbook of Electrical Machines I, complete with bad grammar, formula errors, and all the sweet smelling dryness of cow-dung prepared for fuel, which is apt because those books were some of the few that deserved to be taken to 451 fahrenheit. Clippingsphilosophically we are completely wrong with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws. Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas.From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics. This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric field and charges,The masses given here are the masses of the particles at rest. The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot be at rest.it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth.When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is deflected."
676,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45200517-simon-zou,4,"This is book is great. I started to read it on the recommendation of a professor in Computer Science and because I wanted to ""like"" physics more, as opposed to thinking it's this hard, scary thing. To that end, it's worked, I like physics more than when I started. On the ""Easy"" in the title: The premise of the book is that, of Feyman's lectures on physics, these are the 6 easiest, digestable for a layman with little to no background in the sciences. So I listened to the first couple chapters as an audiobook. The audiobook uses the recordings from the real lectures and are awesome. The written version drops some of his character and jokes in exchange for clarity so it's nice to get both. Feynman waxes poetry about rocks and moons and atoms and how physics relates to other sciences and it's pretty marvelous. However, once at chapter 4, on the conservation of energy, just listening becomes untenable. There are diagrams and equations and concepts that required my full attention to grasp. I switched from listening to reading, to listening and reading at the same time, to asking myself ""at this point why don't I just watch the lectures on YouTube?"". I did that, and all was good. The explanation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics in particular would be pretty hard to get without looking at the diagrams but with them it makes sense, or rather, explains the consistent way in which quantum doesn't make sense. One thing I noticed from perusing all these mediums is that Amazon keeps track of ""popular"" highlights in books and shows them to you. These were far more prevalent in the first three chapters. I wish they made available (but understand why they don't) other stats because I would guess that chapter 4 is where people might have given up on the book. The title says these pieces are ""easy"", but the last few chapters require your full attention and some quantitative reasoning skills to grasp. It's not so easy that I could fully digest the ideas half paying attention while doing the dishes, as was closer to the case with the earlier chapters. Feynman also uses imaginary ""reversible"" machines to explain energy concepts and I'm still not sure I like that or really get what those are about."
677,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97017413-john,3,"This is quite difficult to review. I knew of Feynman (obviously) but hadn't read or seen his famous early 60s lectures before. This book exists as an introduction to the man and his teaching methods but I'm not convinced it does a particularly good job.Definitely don't read this if you want to learn anything about physics, some of the material is very dated (a lot has happened in the world of physics in the last 56 years). Some of it is still relevant but if you didn't know what how would you pick this out from the irrelevant? The blurb on the book says ""the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics"" and I would strongly dispute that.The book gets off to a decent start, the prefaces and introduction set the scene, they tell us that the lecture series wasn't actually that successful with only a few students present targetted by the material so it's hardly surprising only a few stuck with them. Lecture One (Atoms in Motion) is good, a nice introduction to Feynman's method and the subject matter is gentle and well described. But Lecture Two (Basic Physics) is a disaster IMHO, it's a complete mess with Feynman jumping all over the place and not really explaining anything properly and leaving the reader totally confused. Lecture Three (Relationship of Physics to Other Sciences) is very biology biased and spends a lot of time on enzymes. Other sciences are briefly mentioned or pretty much dismissed, geology and meteorology get very short shrift and only go to emphasise how dated the material is. Lecture Four (Conservation of Energy) is better and thank goodness for Lecture Five (Gravitation) and Lecture Six (Quantum Behaviour) which save this book as they are easily the best two and the best advertisement for Feynman. These last two lectures have the most interesting content and we can see how Feynman excels in explaining these difficult concepts.Overall the book hasn't inspired me to tackle more of Feynman's lectures although the final two lectures came close. There are better and more up to date explanations of many of the concepts tackled in this book. I think it's worth reading, it's a very short and quick read, but don't go in to it expecting to learn much physics."
678,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18566696-nitin-dangwal,4,"Richard Feynman was on my to-read list for a long time. I have heard a lot about his teaching methods. His crystal-clear thought that made him teach the most difficult subjects in the most easiest of methods. Given this, I had a lot of expectations from this book. And I was not disappointed.The book is a primer to anyone who wants to brush up their understanding of the basics in Physics. But unlike the books that we have studied, this book is not a bland narration of the concepts. Rather in your hand, this book is alive, with one of the best teachers of the physics speaking to you. Not one page of this short book is boring. And like a thriller, you turn page by page, trying to know what happens next. Almost every chapter of this gem of a book is amazing. But if asked my favorite, it has to be the chapter on Quantum Physics, and the explanation of dual nature of matter and the inherent uncertainty of the quantum world. I find Quantum Physics for one simple reason. It has confounded both physics and religious alike. So weird is the world of quantum that it makes sense to neither of them. For physicists Quantum Physics provide observation that throw everything they have learnt and beliefs down to gutter. For religious person, the quanta world is nothing short than work of devil, where the world has no order - something that they attribute to the god. And what can they so, so astonishingly is the world of quantum. Particles behave likes waves. But when you take a light source to see what is happening, they start behaving like particles again. Nothing is 'is' there. It is always they could be 60% here, and 40% there. Nothing is certain. Everything is probabilistic. Quantum world apart, I love the book majorly for one reason. It sews everything from the concept of heat to the concept of planetary motion in one single narrative. I think this is the major thing that the science education lacks in today's world. So much we have divided physics from chemistry that we don't realize they are the part of one whole story. This book fills this gap. Must read for a light and entertaining read about basic physics"
679,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89960099-john-doe,4,"Yes, it's very much an introduction. Mainly provide a ""big picture"" which chronologically connected scattered topics of modern physics, and most contents are basically high school physics stuff.But still, it's nice to intuitively connecting the dots in your mind. It's a quick read for me 😁 since I was kinda boost on physics in high school period, literally top grades in physics, favorite part was electric circuits design.If it wasn't for something random I would be the kid who loves physics and studied physics all the way up to uni, gradschool, and PhD maybe. Nevertheless I was a kid came across book with words like nuclear physics at age 5. Anyway, reading felt like a breeze after so many years literally disconnected with any physics stuff. Why I picked up physics again, because I need to understand quantum mechanics, and need to understand higher level mathematics in a physics way not merely arithmetics way. There was a lack of visual intuition in advanced pure mathematics area, I think catching up with the area of physics may be the key to develop intuitions.Another interesting point, why Mr.Feynman had a subtle distaste for philosophy?I think Mr.Feynman simply adopted the uncomformist attitude for both personal life and academic breakthrough, and most of the times the reasonings of the majority of philosophers were kind of absolute, which is the very core against what science at the age often adopted, uncertainty or statistical or probabilistic thinking, in other words, everything is by chance not that absolute as philosophers usually argued. However I think that's not a very fair judgement for philosophy the subject in general, nevertheless, the founding father of probability theory Pascal was himself a great philosopher, had profound work not just about mathematics but about thoughts for life in general. Besides, the very thought or intuition of every mathematics breakthrough IS philosophical. Therefore you can not be both anti philosophy and chasing revolutionary breakthrough in whatever area, instead you have to be kinda of philosophical."
680,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110560654-samen-yasar,5,"In the early 60s at Caltech, student interest in physics started declining sharply among undergraduates. Years of rigorous training in the basics meant undergraduates largely weren't able to engage directly with the most recent advancements in the field. To restore motivation in students, the faculty asked Feynman, already quite famous by then, to teach a course on introductory physics to the freshman and sophomore classes. The result was a wonderful series of lectures that was later transcribed and became what is known today as ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". This book contains only six of the easiest and most accessible pieces from that collection.The lectures are true to the intent. Unlike a typical physics lecture, where complex math and sophisticated jargon reigns supreme, Feynman's discussions have the bare minimum of scientific jargon and almost no math. He gets to the essence of complex concepts with just simple thought experiments and intuitive diagrams. It feels almost as if he is telling a story, when in fact he is explaining a rather complicated concept. Though he primarily focuses on basic concepts, he doesn't shy away from connecting them to more advanced concepts whenever he can. Since it was set in the 60s, some parts of the text pertaining to modern physics is a bit outdated. But those aside the text is truly remarkable.If there is any text on physics at all that I would gladly recommend to any fellow non-physicist, it has to be this series of lectures. The text's usage of simple language and the deliberate omission of math lends itself to a very wide audience. Anyone with basic high school level math and science background should be able to follow through easily."
681,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1848040-gabriella-gricius,4,"Why Read: I love physics. I honestly really truly adore learning about physics. The small caveat is that I'm absolutely horrid at it. Learning about how the universe works (not really why, as Feynman points out) is something that I am not particularly gifted in. But nonetheless, I love reading about it. Review: I picked up Six Easy Pieces an age ago. I thought that it would be a great book for me because as previously mentioned, I'm not good at the subject. The basics are most definitely something that I could use a hand in. Everyone has heard of Feynman's lectures, they're practically famous and so reading the first six ""easy"" pieces felt like something doable.Let me disabuse you of that notion. Much as I enjoyed reading this book, I didn't find it doable or easy to comprehend. The first couple chapters are okay, when you learn about gravity and about the magnetic pulls between atoms and planets - but then... then comes the quantum mechanics. Then comes the simple act that physic researchers are just trying to figure out ""how"" things work, rather than ""why."" Before reading this book, I hadn't considered that physics as a science is a bit of a test of experimentation. On one hand, we learn new rules by experimenting and assume they are true until something goes horribly wrong. On the other one, however, we just exist in a state of chaos - never truly knowing about why rules are the way they are. Talk about frustrating.I admit that in reading this book, I was frustrated. I wanted to know about why certain particles acted in the ways they did and... the answers weren't provided to me. Granted, no scientist has the answer so I shouldn't expect a ""Physics for Dummies"" book to help me. Still. It's a fascinating read, and it's not particularly easy. But give it a whirl, and you will be proud of yourself. Rating: 4/5 Stars"

The only reason it doesn’t get five stars is due to my own limitations of absorbing the material put forth. Feynman is a fantastic educator and communicator, and even my poor excuse for a brain was able to glean a much better understanding of the subject.I didn’t do well with Science in school. Looking back, I can honestly say it was an equal mix of my not trying hard enough, and my writing off scientists as ‘evil people against my religion’; a detrimental state of mind inherited from my family. I’ve never studied Physics at all, and still enjoyed this book immensely.I would suggest only reading this if you truly have a longing to understand the universe more. It’s not something to pick up as a ‘light, entertaining read’ for a vacation or airplane ride... And be prepared for SO many equations.I’ll admit, I’m definitely a Feynman fangirl now. I never paid nearly as much attention to any other science than Biology, and I’m glad I’ve found more areas of interest to expand my horizons. I have Mr. Feynman to thank for that. His words have lit up a passion in me similar to how I felt when I read Darwin and Dawkins. I’m not a scientist, a teacher, or particularly clever by any means, but having people who are all of those things; and that are able to explain mind-boggling things to me so succinctly; is a truly marvelous feat. I am forever grateful to the great minds of this world."

Feynman is a brilliant teacher and, he’s arguably one of the smartest scientists in the 19th century next to Prof. Hawking and Einstein. People also believe that Feynman would have discovered “The General Relativity Theory” if Einstein had not done so. I’ve watched some of his lectures & interviews online and i was very impressed, which is why i’ve decided to invest my money & time in buying and reading one of his books. I have to be honest and say that the book is not as easy to understand as one might think. It is not for those that have no physics background at all. I had difficulties when Feynman talked about basic physics and chemistry facts, it was too dry & somehow really complicated. It was not easy to follow up and to understand the content. But, maybe, i lack the minimum knowledge one must have in order to start listening to a great scientist like Feynman in the first place, that is a very good argument indeed.

I was completely lost at some point after the atomic deep dive though, but for good reason according to Feynman, for “Things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale.” and we have to use our imagination when it comes to the quantum. I’m more interested to see how physics can be stretched to philosophy like the incessant movement of atoms and how our body is continually changing even if there are no outward manifestations.I added this book to my reading list after Naval cited it in a podcast I was listening to, walking towards City Super buying a perk me up afternoon drink.***Quotes:What looks like a dead, uninteresting thing — a glass of water with a cover, that has been sitting there for perhaps twenty years — really contains a dynamic and interesting phenomenon which is going on all the time.

Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces speaks about six basic topics involved in Physics in a good, enjoyable and yes in a basic yet comprehensive way. The first chapter describes atoms in detailed, their functionality. The second and the third chapter describe physics and its relation to other sciences, good stuff. To be honest, I think the fourth (Conservation of Energy), fifth (The Theory of Gravitation) and sixth (Quantum Behavior - undoubtedly the heart of the book) were the best chapters in the book. I will not go into details as I don't want my review to be a complete spoiler.Just about the last chapter - It speaks and describes ""The Double Slit"" experiment beautifully like I have never understood it before, very detailed. This one chapter is undoubtedly the gem of the book.I'd definitely recommend this book to starters in Physics as well as to the experienced people in Physics (though you'd have known most of it - you can enjoy Feynman's deep insights).I am looking forward to getting hold of Six not-so Easy Pieces but not anytime soon..."

Accessible does not mean easy, and the book finds a delicate balance to discuss the complex topics+ Very well written or lectured. This was an enjoyable read start to finish as I enjoy Feynman's unique way of explaining things. + Honest and sincere. Where we haven't explored theory enough Feynman will quickly conclude ""we don't know"" and ""we must then find out""Cons- Definitely have to be interested in the topic (duh) but this isn't a book to take a risk on. If physics and the way our universe works is not interesting to you, you will get lost in this book and be unable to follow along- the first half of the book is the real ""easy"" bit and therefore it's critical to consider what easy really means. In this context, easy for students of physics at university level. - very minor gripe, but the formatting of the book.

If you're expecting the jovial, self-aggrandizing Feynman of ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character, you're not going to get him here. This is Professor Feynman cleaned up for the classroom, and cleaned up further for mass ""respectable"" publication.The most illuminating part of this book was by far the quantum mechanics chapter, followed by the very basic chapters on basic molecular structure and physical states. Weirdly, the most obtuse chapters for me were on basic principles of force and energy. The diagrams did nothing for me there.

I had had it recommended to me via a Youtube video by Simon Clark. Anyway, I read it while on vacation and it was really, really good. It presents physics in a way that makes it easy to understand without hiding the details. I must admit that some parts were a little hard to understand and concepts were harder to grasp at some parts of the book. I think this is mainly due to my then younger age and the fact that I am a non-native speaker. I do still recommend it to everyone though. The book is perfect for anyone who thinks that they might enjoy physics and wants a first glance over the concepts. It introduces the concepts of basic principles such as conservation of energy all the way to more modern, advanced concepts such as quantum physics (although briefly and graspable). This book has been really important to me. I've only read it once, but the thought concepts presented in that book has been with me ever since I read it and helped me a lot in school to understand new concepts."

I consider myself to be a little bit more of a history or math oriented person, and I am even more confident about that now after reading the book. Not to say that the book didn't do a good job of simplifying some of Feynman's key points in physics- I believe it does just that. I understand that I am not part of the ""target audience"" from the book, which is why I feel like I didn't retain a whole lot of the more complicated parts. 	The lectures were definitely geared for the top tier science students. Also, at times, I found it a tad difficult to maintain a consistent level of interest through the passages with more data-heavy detail, as you might expect from a science lecture book. As a whole, though, I would say the book was very informative and an interesting read throughout.

703,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6470362-jean-tessier,5,"I while back, I bought a book that introduced math topics to the lay person. This looked like it could do the same for physics. And by none other than Richard Feynman himself.Feynman goes for a more intuitive approach and avoids any complex mathematics. His explanations and examples are strikingly clear. The jiggling of atoms explain the difference between solid, liquid, and gaseous states. Changing arrangements explain chemical reactions, like burning carbon. Everything is made out of atoms, with patterns that defy the imagination.I struggled through the chapter on the conservation of energy. One take-away is that we can explain limits in nature using reversible machines, even though there are no reversible machines in nature. The chapters on gravitation and quantum mechanics were exceedingly clear. The chapter on how physics relates to the other sciences was a lot of fun. So, too, the chapter on gravitation.Tycho Brahe had an idea that was different from anything proposed by the ancients [...] that to find something out, it is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophical arguments. (p. 90) Tycho Brahe took measurements, Kepler deduced laws from these measurements, Galileo figured out inertia, and Newton formulated the law of gravitation (which was later refined by Einstein).I really like how Feynman repeatedly states the limits of science. There are many things that we simply do not know. For now. There may be things we will never know, but many phenomena in the past were deemed inexplicable, only to be explained later.It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. (p. 71) the principle of inertia — if something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.) (p. 93) All we have done is to describe how the earth moves around the sun, but we have not said what makes it go. (p. 107) No one has since given any machinery. (p. 107) Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. (p. 116) Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. (p. 117) According to Feynman, the fact that there are things we do not know does not mean that we are ignorant. We can explain the limits of how things operate with great precision, even though we cannot explain why.About the conservation of energy:There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law -- it is exact so far as we know. (p. 69) As I was reading the book, I often found myself wondering how much progress we've made since it had been written. For instance, in last year's Outgrowing God, Richard Dawkins makes a case for complex chemistry inevitably leads to self-replicating molecules like RNA and DNA, and eventually living organisms.Feynman does not reduce everything to physics. He acknowledges that there are areas of human knowledge outside of science.If something is said not to be a science, it does not mean that there something wrong with it; it just means that it is not a science. (p. 47) "
704,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115843326-liquidlasagna,2,"I adore Feynman, but i don't like reading this book...Why you ask?I find that the pieces were far more easily read in the Feynman Lecture's on physics because of the larger page size, and even the smoother better quality paper.Trying to put those lectures to fit into a smaller book, i find actually makes re-reading the lectures harder. I'm not a fan of the paper and the typeface size, and well to me, it takes away from the smooth flow of the much bigger pages of the original book.It just gives me a claustrophobic feeling.---I need those lectures with the pages extra three inches wider, and four inches taller!!---I was given the whole set, since i had trouble trying to find the original red hardcovers in good shape [they always seemed to be warped], and I found them somewhat rough going when I faced Heisenberg's Uncertainity Principle for the first time, I took a break... I took a break and tried again a while later....He was talking about calculating the orbit of one planet and I struggled in places.Anyways, i decided to take a break for a month or two, and i did exactly what Issac Newton did, i decided to reread things all over again, right from the beginning.I simply burned through the first 100-150 pages of the Feynman Lectures and enjoyed it.But i had two small moments where I realized i was rushing things, and decided, later... later...I couldn't have as much fun browsing Vol II because of the calculus, even though i had the math knowledge at the time, but not the introductory calculus-level university level EM, so browsing those early on, i realized i would face some struggles.[I actually spoke to someone once who went to Caltech in the 60s, and he said that he thought Feynman's Lectures were brutal. He couldn't remember his other textbooks, but i really appreciated his insight 20 years later]It really bums me out since Feynman's writing really is beautiful and deep, and i see a lot of slightly unhappy folks picking up this book and having a hard time with it.I totally sympathize, because i felt let down that my concentration didn't flow with the page as easily, as I thought it might with a neat little hardcover.All I can say is that lots of people who experienced the Lectures in the day, some people were frustrated, and some people were blown away, and some experienced both.----All i can say is that reread the book very slowly and patiently, or borrow a copy of Volume One of the full lectures at the library and browse through them, an read the first 30 pages.and please please please READ, Feynman's autobiography firstSurely You're Joking Mister Feynman [Part I]What Do You Care What Other People Think? [Part II]"
705,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"I read this for all the wrong reasons. It was short and I wanted one more book for the month, and I knew I could blitz through all the basic science blah. I blitzed, it wasn't basic, I learned nothing except that I was insufferable and needed to stop this obnoxious book-counting. Also, Feynman was inappropriate and a irrascible, didn't knew. The writing is easy, likeable, and clear, I really wish I'd been able to sit in on one of his lectures, those must have been incredible. But I guess I had the next best thing, Bharatidasan kicking me out for the 10th time in a week because I wasn't adequately spellbound by his reading out from the illustrated guide to the simplified extract of Indian transliteration to the official university textbook of Electrical Machines I, complete with bad grammar, formula errors, and all the sweet smelling dryness of cow-dung prepared for fuel, which is apt because those books were some of the few that deserved to be taken to 451 fahrenheit. Clippingsphilosophically we are completely wrong with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws. Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas.From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics. This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric field and charges,The masses given here are the masses of the particles at rest. The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot be at rest.it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth.When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is deflected."
706,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45200517-simon-zou,4,"This is book is great. I started to read it on the recommendation of a professor in Computer Science and because I wanted to ""like"" physics more, as opposed to thinking it's this hard, scary thing. To that end, it's worked, I like physics more than when I started. On the ""Easy"" in the title: The premise of the book is that, of Feyman's lectures on physics, these are the 6 easiest, digestable for a layman with little to no background in the sciences. So I listened to the first couple chapters as an audiobook. The audiobook uses the recordings from the real lectures and are awesome. The written version drops some of his character and jokes in exchange for clarity so it's nice to get both. Feynman waxes poetry about rocks and moons and atoms and how physics relates to other sciences and it's pretty marvelous. However, once at chapter 4, on the conservation of energy, just listening becomes untenable. There are diagrams and equations and concepts that required my full attention to grasp. I switched from listening to reading, to listening and reading at the same time, to asking myself ""at this point why don't I just watch the lectures on YouTube?"". I did that, and all was good. The explanation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics in particular would be pretty hard to get without looking at the diagrams but with them it makes sense, or rather, explains the consistent way in which quantum doesn't make sense. One thing I noticed from perusing all these mediums is that Amazon keeps track of ""popular"" highlights in books and shows them to you. These were far more prevalent in the first three chapters. I wish they made available (but understand why they don't) other stats because I would guess that chapter 4 is where people might have given up on the book. The title says these pieces are ""easy"", but the last few chapters require your full attention and some quantitative reasoning skills to grasp. It's not so easy that I could fully digest the ideas half paying attention while doing the dishes, as was closer to the case with the earlier chapters. Feynman also uses imaginary ""reversible"" machines to explain energy concepts and I'm still not sure I like that or really get what those are about."
707,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97017413-john,3,"This is quite difficult to review. I knew of Feynman (obviously) but hadn't read or seen his famous early 60s lectures before. This book exists as an introduction to the man and his teaching methods but I'm not convinced it does a particularly good job.Definitely don't read this if you want to learn anything about physics, some of the material is very dated (a lot has happened in the world of physics in the last 56 years). Some of it is still relevant but if you didn't know what how would you pick this out from the irrelevant? The blurb on the book says ""the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics"" and I would strongly dispute that.The book gets off to a decent start, the prefaces and introduction set the scene, they tell us that the lecture series wasn't actually that successful with only a few students present targetted by the material so it's hardly surprising only a few stuck with them. Lecture One (Atoms in Motion) is good, a nice introduction to Feynman's method and the subject matter is gentle and well described. But Lecture Two (Basic Physics) is a disaster IMHO, it's a complete mess with Feynman jumping all over the place and not really explaining anything properly and leaving the reader totally confused. Lecture Three (Relationship of Physics to Other Sciences) is very biology biased and spends a lot of time on enzymes. Other sciences are briefly mentioned or pretty much dismissed, geology and meteorology get very short shrift and only go to emphasise how dated the material is. Lecture Four (Conservation of Energy) is better and thank goodness for Lecture Five (Gravitation) and Lecture Six (Quantum Behaviour) which save this book as they are easily the best two and the best advertisement for Feynman. These last two lectures have the most interesting content and we can see how Feynman excels in explaining these difficult concepts.Overall the book hasn't inspired me to tackle more of Feynman's lectures although the final two lectures came close. There are better and more up to date explanations of many of the concepts tackled in this book. I think it's worth reading, it's a very short and quick read, but don't go in to it expecting to learn much physics."
708,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18566696-nitin-dangwal,4,"Richard Feynman was on my to-read list for a long time. I have heard a lot about his teaching methods. His crystal-clear thought that made him teach the most difficult subjects in the most easiest of methods. Given this, I had a lot of expectations from this book. And I was not disappointed.The book is a primer to anyone who wants to brush up their understanding of the basics in Physics. But unlike the books that we have studied, this book is not a bland narration of the concepts. Rather in your hand, this book is alive, with one of the best teachers of the physics speaking to you. Not one page of this short book is boring. And like a thriller, you turn page by page, trying to know what happens next. Almost every chapter of this gem of a book is amazing. But if asked my favorite, it has to be the chapter on Quantum Physics, and the explanation of dual nature of matter and the inherent uncertainty of the quantum world. I find Quantum Physics for one simple reason. It has confounded both physics and religious alike. So weird is the world of quantum that it makes sense to neither of them. For physicists Quantum Physics provide observation that throw everything they have learnt and beliefs down to gutter. For religious person, the quanta world is nothing short than work of devil, where the world has no order - something that they attribute to the god. And what can they so, so astonishingly is the world of quantum. Particles behave likes waves. But when you take a light source to see what is happening, they start behaving like particles again. Nothing is 'is' there. It is always they could be 60% here, and 40% there. Nothing is certain. Everything is probabilistic. Quantum world apart, I love the book majorly for one reason. It sews everything from the concept of heat to the concept of planetary motion in one single narrative. I think this is the major thing that the science education lacks in today's world. So much we have divided physics from chemistry that we don't realize they are the part of one whole story. This book fills this gap. Must read for a light and entertaining read about basic physics"
709,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89960099-john-doe,4,"Yes, it's very much an introduction. Mainly provide a ""big picture"" which chronologically connected scattered topics of modern physics, and most contents are basically high school physics stuff.But still, it's nice to intuitively connecting the dots in your mind. It's a quick read for me 😁 since I was kinda boost on physics in high school period, literally top grades in physics, favorite part was electric circuits design.If it wasn't for something random I would be the kid who loves physics and studied physics all the way up to uni, gradschool, and PhD maybe. Nevertheless I was a kid came across book with words like nuclear physics at age 5. Anyway, reading felt like a breeze after so many years literally disconnected with any physics stuff. Why I picked up physics again, because I need to understand quantum mechanics, and need to understand higher level mathematics in a physics way not merely arithmetics way. There was a lack of visual intuition in advanced pure mathematics area, I think catching up with the area of physics may be the key to develop intuitions.Another interesting point, why Mr.Feynman had a subtle distaste for philosophy?I think Mr.Feynman simply adopted the uncomformist attitude for both personal life and academic breakthrough, and most of the times the reasonings of the majority of philosophers were kind of absolute, which is the very core against what science at the age often adopted, uncertainty or statistical or probabilistic thinking, in other words, everything is by chance not that absolute as philosophers usually argued. However I think that's not a very fair judgement for philosophy the subject in general, nevertheless, the founding father of probability theory Pascal was himself a great philosopher, had profound work not just about mathematics but about thoughts for life in general. Besides, the very thought or intuition of every mathematics breakthrough IS philosophical. Therefore you can not be both anti philosophy and chasing revolutionary breakthrough in whatever area, instead you have to be kinda of philosophical."
710,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110560654-samen-yasar,5,"In the early 60s at Caltech, student interest in physics started declining sharply among undergraduates. Years of rigorous training in the basics meant undergraduates largely weren't able to engage directly with the most recent advancements in the field. To restore motivation in students, the faculty asked Feynman, already quite famous by then, to teach a course on introductory physics to the freshman and sophomore classes. The result was a wonderful series of lectures that was later transcribed and became what is known today as ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". This book contains only six of the easiest and most accessible pieces from that collection.The lectures are true to the intent. Unlike a typical physics lecture, where complex math and sophisticated jargon reigns supreme, Feynman's discussions have the bare minimum of scientific jargon and almost no math. He gets to the essence of complex concepts with just simple thought experiments and intuitive diagrams. It feels almost as if he is telling a story, when in fact he is explaining a rather complicated concept. Though he primarily focuses on basic concepts, he doesn't shy away from connecting them to more advanced concepts whenever he can. Since it was set in the 60s, some parts of the text pertaining to modern physics is a bit outdated. But those aside the text is truly remarkable.If there is any text on physics at all that I would gladly recommend to any fellow non-physicist, it has to be this series of lectures. The text's usage of simple language and the deliberate omission of math lends itself to a very wide audience. Anyone with basic high school level math and science background should be able to follow through easily."
711,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1848040-gabriella-gricius,4,"Why Read: I love physics. I honestly really truly adore learning about physics. The small caveat is that I'm absolutely horrid at it. Learning about how the universe works (not really why, as Feynman points out) is something that I am not particularly gifted in. But nonetheless, I love reading about it. Review: I picked up Six Easy Pieces an age ago. I thought that it would be a great book for me because as previously mentioned, I'm not good at the subject. The basics are most definitely something that I could use a hand in. Everyone has heard of Feynman's lectures, they're practically famous and so reading the first six ""easy"" pieces felt like something doable.Let me disabuse you of that notion. Much as I enjoyed reading this book, I didn't find it doable or easy to comprehend. The first couple chapters are okay, when you learn about gravity and about the magnetic pulls between atoms and planets - but then... then comes the quantum mechanics. Then comes the simple act that physic researchers are just trying to figure out ""how"" things work, rather than ""why."" Before reading this book, I hadn't considered that physics as a science is a bit of a test of experimentation. On one hand, we learn new rules by experimenting and assume they are true until something goes horribly wrong. On the other one, however, we just exist in a state of chaos - never truly knowing about why rules are the way they are. Talk about frustrating.I admit that in reading this book, I was frustrated. I wanted to know about why certain particles acted in the ways they did and... the answers weren't provided to me. Granted, no scientist has the answer so I shouldn't expect a ""Physics for Dummies"" book to help me. Still. It's a fascinating read, and it's not particularly easy. But give it a whirl, and you will be proud of yourself. Rating: 4/5 Stars"

The only reason it doesn’t get five stars is due to my own limitations of absorbing the material put forth. Feynman is a fantastic educator and communicator, and even my poor excuse for a brain was able to glean a much better understanding of the subject.I didn’t do well with Science in school. Looking back, I can honestly say it was an equal mix of my not trying hard enough, and my writing off scientists as ‘evil people against my religion’; a detrimental state of mind inherited from my family. I’ve never studied Physics at all, and still enjoyed this book immensely.I would suggest only reading this if you truly have a longing to understand the universe more. It’s not something to pick up as a ‘light, entertaining read’ for a vacation or airplane ride... And be prepared for SO many equations.I’ll admit, I’m definitely a Feynman fangirl now. I never paid nearly as much attention to any other science than Biology, and I’m glad I’ve found more areas of interest to expand my horizons. I have Mr. Feynman to thank for that. His words have lit up a passion in me similar to how I felt when I read Darwin and Dawkins. I’m not a scientist, a teacher, or particularly clever by any means, but having people who are all of those things; and that are able to explain mind-boggling things to me so succinctly; is a truly marvelous feat. I am forever grateful to the great minds of this world."

Feynman is a brilliant teacher and, he’s arguably one of the smartest scientists in the 19th century next to Prof. Hawking and Einstein. People also believe that Feynman would have discovered “The General Relativity Theory” if Einstein had not done so. I’ve watched some of his lectures & interviews online and i was very impressed, which is why i’ve decided to invest my money & time in buying and reading one of his books. I have to be honest and say that the book is not as easy to understand as one might think. It is not for those that have no physics background at all. I had difficulties when Feynman talked about basic physics and chemistry facts, it was too dry & somehow really complicated. It was not easy to follow up and to understand the content. But, maybe, i lack the minimum knowledge one must have in order to start listening to a great scientist like Feynman in the first place, that is a very good argument indeed.

I was completely lost at some point after the atomic deep dive though, but for good reason according to Feynman, for “Things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale.” and we have to use our imagination when it comes to the quantum. I’m more interested to see how physics can be stretched to philosophy like the incessant movement of atoms and how our body is continually changing even if there are no outward manifestations.I added this book to my reading list after Naval cited it in a podcast I was listening to, walking towards City Super buying a perk me up afternoon drink.***Quotes:What looks like a dead, uninteresting thing — a glass of water with a cover, that has been sitting there for perhaps twenty years — really contains a dynamic and interesting phenomenon which is going on all the time.

Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces speaks about six basic topics involved in Physics in a good, enjoyable and yes in a basic yet comprehensive way. The first chapter describes atoms in detailed, their functionality. The second and the third chapter describe physics and its relation to other sciences, good stuff. To be honest, I think the fourth (Conservation of Energy), fifth (The Theory of Gravitation) and sixth (Quantum Behavior - undoubtedly the heart of the book) were the best chapters in the book. I will not go into details as I don't want my review to be a complete spoiler.Just about the last chapter - It speaks and describes ""The Double Slit"" experiment beautifully like I have never understood it before, very detailed. This one chapter is undoubtedly the gem of the book.I'd definitely recommend this book to starters in Physics as well as to the experienced people in Physics (though you'd have known most of it - you can enjoy Feynman's deep insights).I am looking forward to getting hold of Six not-so Easy Pieces but not anytime soon..."

Accessible does not mean easy, and the book finds a delicate balance to discuss the complex topics+ Very well written or lectured. This was an enjoyable read start to finish as I enjoy Feynman's unique way of explaining things. + Honest and sincere. Where we haven't explored theory enough Feynman will quickly conclude ""we don't know"" and ""we must then find out""Cons- Definitely have to be interested in the topic (duh) but this isn't a book to take a risk on. If physics and the way our universe works is not interesting to you, you will get lost in this book and be unable to follow along- the first half of the book is the real ""easy"" bit and therefore it's critical to consider what easy really means. In this context, easy for students of physics at university level. - very minor gripe, but the formatting of the book.

If you're expecting the jovial, self-aggrandizing Feynman of ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character, you're not going to get him here. This is Professor Feynman cleaned up for the classroom, and cleaned up further for mass ""respectable"" publication.The most illuminating part of this book was by far the quantum mechanics chapter, followed by the very basic chapters on basic molecular structure and physical states. Weirdly, the most obtuse chapters for me were on basic principles of force and energy. The diagrams did nothing for me there. I think a static medium of printed words and diagrams is maybe not the best for that subject."

I had had it recommended to me via a Youtube video by Simon Clark. Anyway, I read it while on vacation and it was really, really good. It presents physics in a way that makes it easy to understand without hiding the details. I must admit that some parts were a little hard to understand and concepts were harder to grasp at some parts of the book. I think this is mainly due to my then younger age and the fact that I am a non-native speaker. I do still recommend it to everyone though. The book is perfect for anyone who thinks that they might enjoy physics and wants a first glance over the concepts. It introduces the concepts of basic principles such as conservation of energy all the way to more modern, advanced concepts such as quantum physics (although briefly and graspable). This book has been really important to me. I've only read it once, but the thought concepts presented in that book has been with me ever since I read it and helped me a lot in school to understand new concepts."

I consider myself to be a little bit more of a history or math oriented person, and I am even more confident about that now after reading the book. Not to say that the book didn't do a good job of simplifying some of Feynman's key points in physics- I believe it does just that. I understand that I am not part of the ""target audience"" from the book, which is why I feel like I didn't retain a whole lot of the more complicated parts. 	The lectures were definitely geared for the top tier science students. Also, at times, I found it a tad difficult to maintain a consistent level of interest through the passages with more data-heavy detail, as you might expect from a science lecture book.

Really inspiring stuff from this point of view.But, as someone also interested in the actual content of the book, it was a great read.

It is really interesting!!!If you want to read this book, please just keep in mind that its chapters are extracted from the first volume of Feynman lectures on Physics ( that has 3 volumes and 52 chapters just in the first one ), and from different spots. So for example, in the last chapter "" Quantum Behavior "", I had to explain some technical words and/or watch some Youtube videos to get the idea and be able to understand what the author is saying. And that's because sometimes he referred to chapters that I haven't read yet or used some words that I didn't understand. But I think that it's a great way to start!Anyways, it is indeed a wonderful book. But if you are unfamiliar with physics, don't feel bad for reading a paragraph more than once and defining words that you don't understand. When you'll keep building your understanding slowly, you'll definitely ENJOY the book and be AMAZED by its content!"
728,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77962764-ishan,4,"Billed as a layman's guide, but more complicated than that in reality. It is, after all, an abridged version of lectures given to university level physics students, and Feynman thus assumes some understanding of advanced maths and some scientific principles. This can make it occasionally impenetrable for the average reader. For the most part, however, Feynman's explanations are enchantingly lucid and occasionally even poetic, and the reader is sure to come away understanding just a little bit more about how the laws of the universe work, even if baffled by the formulas. I certainly did. It might even make you believe in a higher power - though not necessarily in any religious sense. I found myself awed by some of the truths Feynman uncovered, and the explanations (or lack of them) that he provided. This is certainly a brilliant primer for anyone looking to understand something about physics."

(Oh, how I wish he could have had access to what we have available today! If he could've studied Hubble images! ) As stated in the preface, Feynman wondered if there was a way to expose undergraduate students of physics with the excitement of the frontier instead of boring them for their first two years. He wondered why if there was way to bring the excitement of relativity and quantum mechanics to incoming freshman. His experiment, these lectures, was a failure, in his opinion, but someone had to try. I loved reading these and will definitely incorporate some of these connections into my own teaching. My favorite quote, from page 103,""That the law of gravitation is true even at bigger distances is indicated in Fig. 5-8. If one cannot see gravitation acting here, he has no soul."""

But, don't be fooled by how easy things look in the book. In the real world, the ones who attended these lectures were not beginners who want to learn Physics. It was his peers and Graduates who wanted to get his perspective. That's his speciality. You know how Chemistry works and how we smell. But, when he explains the concept, we can visualize everything in a completely different way. The last chapter about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle was the best of the lot. I am pretty sure that even if I wanted to , I can never forget how Quantum Mechanics originated. The real life ELI5. Worth reading it again and again till you understand.

The chapter on quantum physics gives one of the best explanations of the process, not trivial and some knowledge of imaginary numbers would be useful too, but still one of the best pieces explaining whats going on down there. Still to figure out/review, relationship of the Schrodinger's cat paradox and the uncertainty principle, the uncertainty principle at a macroscopic level, imaginary numbers, try to start observations on planetary orbits and figure out the math behind to compute trajectories, speed, mass, etc. Review the math behind pulleys and other simple machines.

All reports of him being an excellent lecturer ring true.I tried to think about how to review this for non-scientists. This is a selection of six chapters chosen from the larger set of Feynman lectures - seemingly chosen for relative simplicity. But they're all over the place. I didn't remember there being a discussion of biology in one, and the quantum mechanics piece is (as they admit) more complex than the rest. I will admit, though, some of his double-slit experiment discussion was freshly insightful to me.I can't get it out of my head how these lectures succeeded and failed simultaneously. It felt like he just went up there and (in a clear and interesting way) talked. As a window into his thinking, it's interesting. I couldn't picture these pieces being a coherent part of a class."

That doesn't mean his wit and enthusiasm don't come across in these lectures, and the photographs of him teaching practically vibrate with his excitement. As one of the critics of Feynman's lectures on physics wrote, reading his lectures ""is like trying to drink from a fire hose."" Still, just because it's hard work, and because they're are portions of the book where I needed more explanation, doesn't mean that there isn't something exhilarating about going through the very start of physics with the best American physicist of the twentieth century as a guide. There's also something to be said for getting something of a glimpse into real brilliance. I learned some physics, though I've learned more from other authors, but this was more exciting."
734,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88199233-rick,4,"A really good introduction to physics throughout the particular, original and unique style of R.P. Feynman. It is easily understandable for who is familiar with the most concepts of science and physics in particular, but there are no great barriers for those who just don't have some primary base concepts. That's because Feynman writes not just about science, but about the humans behind it.And in doing so he manages to take out science from - literally - a glass of water.And this is the ability of a wise and valuable man, not just that of a super clever scientist (even if in this case both the two option corresponds to him and describe him).I advise everyone flow in the magnificent World Feynman is able to describe: it is just about some Beauty that can not be unrevealed.

The diagrams are a bit outdated, but that is to be expected from a book that pulls its body from lectures that took place in the 1960s. While the introductory chapter does a great job, it is quickly undone midway through chapter two. However, I encourage readers to trudge on as the book does recover slowly in chapters three and four before ultimately redeeming itself in chapters five and six. As stated in the books introduction, this work is targeted toward a selected audience, that audience being those that are truly interested in pursuing physics and/or other sciences. This is not something you would want to read if you're just looking to dabble. This book has encouraged me to check out the Feynman lectures in their entirety."

Like many incredibly intelligent people, he can often present ideas as obvious when a mere mortal like me cannot immediately grab them.As university lectures, these six easy pieces do create a foundation but I found often it was too high level and had to be taken on faith. Surprisingly, I found his description of quantum physics to be the most accessible of the six pieces taking very complex ideas and explaining them as well as illuminating the reasons for fundamental doubt. Frustratingly, he refers to future lectures which do not appear in the book.It is however a valuable publication showing a viewpoint drawn from extreme intellect."

Though it is adviced to have at least high school level knowledge of maths, physics and chemistry. Otherwise it might seem like he's going too fast through certain topics. It's usefull to be comfortable with these subjects. Especially around the final two chapters when he gets into the good stuff (law of gravitation and quantum mechanics).Overall I'd recommend this book to anyone curious enough to get a basic view of the world from a physics perspective without all the technical jargon (though it has some. But they're properly explained) and maths. This is a must read for aspiring STEM majors."

It covers physics without resorting to mathematical formulae. This is the strength of Dr Feynmans knack for breaking things down and explaining it in the easiest terms possible for the audience. This definitely sparked the imagination and made me want to learn more. However, the lack of math is also this books weakness. Six easy pieces are taken from lectures and some of them presuppose previous knowledge that the reader might not necessarily have. At times I felt that I needed that extra bit of math with couple easy problems to solve myself to grasp the concepts a little quicker. If you are interested in science and thinking of pursuing physics this book would get my wholehearted recommendation."

Reading the first chapter of Six Easy Pieces guided my decision making and I shortly enrolled myself into a science and engineering program. I revisited this book recently after recommending it to my girlfriend (a liberal arts student aspiring to switch to science) and realized how foundational the writing in this book is to anyone wanting to understand science. To the kids of the future, this should be made essential reading to grok that science is not about memorization and solving equations but about reasoning first principles. Richard Feynman is the greatest teacher and then a Nobel Laureate."

It attempts to present Physics in an intuitive way, with little or no maths involved. It contains great pieces of intuition (the conservation of energy and its applications are brilliant, and the linking of physics with other disciplines is superb). However, there are other parts where one perceives it shows a bit of its age. For example, the quantum physics part doesn't mention the Standard Model nor its problem (obviously since the standard model is from the 70s). But again, this is a brilliant piece and very easy to read."

It provides an intuitive approach to the physic, very useful especially to understand the gravitational theory, demonstrating that with logic and reasoning it is possible to deduct the very basic pillar of the physic without recurring to formulas and equations (actually there are few equations here and there, but no rocket science involved).I will keep it on my shelf and I will read it again now and then as a refresher.

In any case, if you would like to learn basic intuition of how atoms work, how quantum mechanics came to be, or what the uncertainty principle is, this is the book for you. Some intuitions and images that are talked about in the book are very useful in visualizing the concepts.

By really difficult I mean it's practically impossible to imagine all the things that should happen when an experiment is done. It's better to watch this somewhere instead of reading it. That's why I though some of the lectures in this book are better to be done in a video format.Other than that, I learned quite a few things throughout the book so there were parts I enjoyed a lot.

I had already read a few books about Feynman himself, and thought it would be worthwhile to read from these famous lectures of his. Of course, if what's said is true, the man was a performer in front of a classroom, and little justice can be done from simply reading his lectures. It was still nice to get a small glimpse into his teaching style. "

I quite enjoyed this, the only problem was that it was first published in 1963, which means some of the information in the book was a little out of date or behind the modern standards. There were also a number of references to 'recent discoveries' which were, of course, from the late 50s and early 60s, which held little interest for me at all.

Really inspiring stuff from this point of view.But, as someone also interested in the actual content of the book, it was a great read. I've given it 3 stars simply because I was too ignorant of the basics to actually make any real sense of the chemistry parts of the book and much of the mathematical stuff."
757,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96185483-haytam,5,"This book is a great introduction to the world of physics!! It is really interesting!!!If you want to read this book, please just keep in mind that its chapters are extracted from the first volume of Feynman lectures on Physics ( that has 3 volumes and 52 chapters just in the first one ), and from different spots. So for example, in the last chapter "" Quantum Behavior "", I had to explain some technical words and/or watch some Youtube videos to get the idea and be able to understand what the author is saying. And that's because sometimes he referred to chapters that I haven't read yet or used some words that I didn't understand. But I think that it's a great way to start!Anyways, it is indeed a wonderful book. But if you are unfamiliar with physics, don't feel bad for reading a paragraph more than once and defining words that you don't understand. When you'll keep building your understanding slowly, you'll definitely ENJOY the book and be AMAZED by its content!"
758,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77962764-ishan,4,"Billed as a layman's guide, but more complicated than that in reality. It is, after all, an abridged version of lectures given to university level physics students, and Feynman thus assumes some understanding of advanced maths and some scientific principles. This can make it occasionally impenetrable for the average reader. For the most part, however, Feynman's explanations are enchantingly lucid and occasionally even poetic, and the reader is sure to come away understanding just a little bit more about how the laws of the universe work, even if baffled by the formulas. I certainly did. It might even make you believe in a higher power - though not necessarily in any religious sense. I found myself awed by some of the truths Feynman uncovered, and the explanations (or lack of them) that he provided. This is certainly a brilliant primer for anyone looking to understand something about physics."
759,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2539789-lisa-manske,5,"As always, Feynman is a delight. I thoroughly enjoyed this ""conversation"" with theoretical physics of the 1960s. (Oh, how I wish he could have had access to what we have available today! If he could've studied Hubble images! ) As stated in the preface, Feynman wondered if there was a way to expose undergraduate students of physics with the excitement of the frontier instead of boring them for their first two years. He wondered why if there was way to bring the excitement of relativity and quantum mechanics to incoming freshman. His experiment, these lectures, was a failure, in his opinion, but someone had to try. I loved reading these and will definitely incorporate some of these connections into my own teaching. My favorite quote, from page 103,""That the law of gravitation is true even at bigger distances is indicated in Fig. 5-8. If one cannot see gravitation acting here, he has no soul."""

But, don't be fooled by how easy things look in the book. In the real world, the ones who attended these lectures were not beginners who want to learn Physics. It was his peers and Graduates who wanted to get his perspective. That's his speciality. You know how Chemistry works and how we smell. But, when he explains the concept, we can visualize everything in a completely different way. The last chapter about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle was the best of the lot. I am pretty sure that even if I wanted to , I can never forget how Quantum Mechanics originated. The real life ELI5. Worth reading it again and again till you understand.

His description of the principle of conservation of energy and its relationship to potential/kinetic/electromagnetic attraction computation is beautiful. The chapter on quantum physics gives one of the best explanations of the process, not trivial and some knowledge of imaginary numbers would be useful too, but still one of the best pieces explaining whats going on down there. Still to figure out/review, relationship of the Schrodinger's cat paradox and the uncertainty principle, the uncertainty principle at a macroscopic level, imaginary numbers, try to start observations on planetary orbits and figure out the math behind to compute trajectories, speed, mass, etc. Review the math behind pulleys and other simple machines.

All reports of him being an excellent lecturer ring true.I tried to think about how to review this for non-scientists. This is a selection of six chapters chosen from the larger set of Feynman lectures - seemingly chosen for relative simplicity. But they're all over the place. I didn't remember there being a discussion of biology in one, and the quantum mechanics piece is (as they admit) more complex than the rest. I will admit, though, some of his double-slit experiment discussion was freshly insightful to me.I can't get it out of my head how these lectures succeeded and failed simultaneously. It felt like he just went up there and (in a clear and interesting way) talked. As a window into his thinking, it's interesting. I couldn't picture these pieces being a coherent part of a class."

That doesn't mean his wit and enthusiasm don't come across in these lectures, and the photographs of him teaching practically vibrate with his excitement. As one of the critics of Feynman's lectures on physics wrote, reading his lectures ""is like trying to drink from a fire hose."" Still, just because it's hard work, and because they're are portions of the book where I needed more explanation, doesn't mean that there isn't something exhilarating about going through the very start of physics with the best American physicist of the twentieth century as a guide. There's also something to be said for getting something of a glimpse into real brilliance. I learned some physics, though I've learned more from other authors, but this was more exciting."
764,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88199233-rick,4,"A really good introduction to physics throughout the particular, original and unique style of R.P. Feynman. It is easily understandable for who is familiar with the most concepts of science and physics in particular, but there are no great barriers for those who just don't have some primary base concepts. That's because Feynman writes not just about science, but about the humans behind it.And in doing so he manages to take out science from - literally - a glass of water.And this is the ability of a wise and valuable man, not just that of a super clever scientist (even if in this case both the two option corresponds to him and describe him).I advise everyone flow in the magnificent World Feynman is able to describe: it is just about some Beauty that can not be unrevealed.

The diagrams are a bit outdated, but that is to be expected from a book that pulls its body from lectures that took place in the 1960s. While the introductory chapter does a great job, it is quickly undone midway through chapter two. However, I encourage readers to trudge on as the book does recover slowly in chapters three and four before ultimately redeeming itself in chapters five and six. As stated in the books introduction, this work is targeted toward a selected audience, that audience being those that are truly interested in pursuing physics and/or other sciences. This is not something you would want to read if you're just looking to dabble. This book has encouraged me to check out the Feynman lectures in their entirety."
766,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49435353-john-s,3,"""Easy"" is a subjective term. There is no doubt about Feynman's depth of knowledge and willingness to explain ideas. Like many incredibly intelligent people, he can often present ideas as obvious when a mere mortal like me cannot immediately grab them.As university lectures, these six easy pieces do create a foundation but I found often it was too high level and had to be taken on faith. Surprisingly, I found his description of quantum physics to be the most accessible of the six pieces taking very complex ideas and explaining them as well as illuminating the reasons for fundamental doubt. Frustratingly, he refers to future lectures which do not appear in the book.It is however a valuable publication showing a viewpoint drawn from extreme intellect."
767,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58618743-nazir,5,"Amazing, clear and concise book to introduce some of the pure physics concepts to the common reader. Though it is adviced to have at least high school level knowledge of maths, physics and chemistry. Otherwise it might seem like he's going too fast through certain topics. It's usefull to be comfortable with these subjects. Especially around the final two chapters when he gets into the good stuff (law of gravitation and quantum mechanics).Overall I'd recommend this book to anyone curious enough to get a basic view of the world from a physics perspective without all the technical jargon (though it has some. But they're properly explained) and maths. This is a must read for aspiring STEM majors."
768,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38008473-odyssey,4,"I feel that this book straddles the line between popular science and a physics lesson. It covers physics without resorting to mathematical formulae. This is the strength of Dr Feynmans knack for breaking things down and explaining it in the easiest terms possible for the audience. This definitely sparked the imagination and made me want to learn more. However, the lack of math is also this books weakness. Six easy pieces are taken from lectures and some of them presuppose previous knowledge that the reader might not necessarily have. At times I felt that I needed that extra bit of math with couple easy problems to solve myself to grasp the concepts a little quicker. If you are interested in science and thinking of pursuing physics this book would get my wholehearted recommendation."

Reading the first chapter of Six Easy Pieces guided my decision making and I shortly enrolled myself into a science and engineering program. I revisited this book recently after recommending it to my girlfriend (a liberal arts student aspiring to switch to science) and realized how foundational the writing in this book is to anyone wanting to understand science. To the kids of the future, this should be made essential reading to grok that science is not about memorization and solving equations but about reasoning first principles. Richard Feynman is the greatest teacher and then a Nobel Laureate."

It attempts to present Physics in an intuitive way, with little or no maths involved. It contains great pieces of intuition (the conservation of energy and its applications are brilliant, and the linking of physics with other disciplines is superb). However, there are other parts where one perceives it shows a bit of its age. For example, the quantum physics part doesn't mention the Standard Model nor its problem (obviously since the standard model is from the 70s). But again, this is a brilliant piece and very easy to read."

It provides an intuitive approach to the physic, very useful especially to understand the gravitational theory, demonstrating that with logic and reasoning it is possible to deduct the very basic pillar of the physic without recurring to formulas and equations (actually there are few equations here and there, but no rocket science involved).I will keep it on my shelf and I will read it again now and then as a refresher.

In any case, if you would like to learn basic intuition of how atoms work, how quantum mechanics came to be, or what the uncertainty principle is, this is the book for you. Some intuitions and images that are talked about in the book are very useful in visualizing the concepts. The next day after I read this book, I saw water vapor and I started thinking about how heat is causing the molecules to bounce from the surface of water. "

By really difficult I mean it's practically impossible to imagine all the things that should happen when an experiment is done. It's better to watch this somewhere instead of reading it. That's why I though some of the lectures in this book are better to be done in a video format.Other than that, I learned quite a few things throughout the book so there were parts I enjoyed a lot. Just a book is not the ideal format for these lectures, in my opinion."

With that said, physics boasts a long history of some of the most interesting scientists, and Feynman is a personal favorite. I had already read a few books about Feynman himself, and thought it would be worthwhile to read from these famous lectures of his. Of course, if what's said is true, the man was a performer in front of a classroom, and little justice can be done from simply reading his lectures. It was still nice to get a small glimpse into his teaching style. "

I quite enjoyed this, the only problem was that it was first published in 1963, which means some of the information in the book was a little out of date or behind the modern standards. There were also a number of references to 'recent discoveries' which were, of course, from the late 50s and early 60s, which held little interest for me at all. However, certainly in its day it would have been a brilliant book, and that it still mostly holds up now is a testament to Feynman."

793,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6470362-jean-tessier,5,"I while back, I bought a book that introduced math topics to the lay person. This looked like it could do the same for physics. And by none other than Richard Feynman himself.Feynman goes for a more intuitive approach and avoids any complex mathematics. His explanations and examples are strikingly clear. The jiggling of atoms explain the difference between solid, liquid, and gaseous states. Changing arrangements explain chemical reactions, like burning carbon. Everything is made out of atoms, with patterns that defy the imagination.I struggled through the chapter on the conservation of energy. One take-away is that we can explain limits in nature using reversible machines, even though there are no reversible machines in nature. The chapters on gravitation and quantum mechanics were exceedingly clear. The chapter on how physics relates to the other sciences was a lot of fun. So, too, the chapter on gravitation.Tycho Brahe had an idea that was different from anything proposed by the ancients [...] that to find something out, it is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophical arguments. (p. 90) Tycho Brahe took measurements, Kepler deduced laws from these measurements, Galileo figured out inertia, and Newton formulated the law of gravitation (which was later refined by Einstein).I really like how Feynman repeatedly states the limits of science. There are many things that we simply do not know. For now. There may be things we will never know, but many phenomena in the past were deemed inexplicable, only to be explained later.It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. (p. 71) the principle of inertia — if something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.) (p. 93) All we have done is to describe how the earth moves around the sun, but we have not said what makes it go. (p. 107) No one has since given any machinery. (p. 107) Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. (p. 116) Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. (p. 117) According to Feynman, the fact that there are things we do not know does not mean that we are ignorant. We can explain the limits of how things operate with great precision, even though we cannot explain why.About the conservation of energy:There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law -- it is exact so far as we know. (p. 69) As I was reading the book, I often found myself wondering how much progress we've made since it had been written. For instance, in last year's Outgrowing God, Richard Dawkins makes a case for complex chemistry inevitably leads to self-replicating molecules like RNA and DNA, and eventually living organisms.Feynman does not reduce everything to physics. He acknowledges that there are areas of human knowledge outside of science.If something is said not to be a science, it does not mean that there something wrong with it; it just means that it is not a science. (p. 47) "

I'm not a fan of the paper and the typeface size, and well to me, it takes away from the smooth flow of the much bigger pages of the original book.It just gives me a claustrophobic feeling.---I need those lectures with the pages extra three inches wider, and four inches taller!!---I was given the whole set, since i had trouble trying to find the original red hardcovers in good shape [they always seemed to be warped], and I found them somewhat rough going when I faced Heisenberg's Uncertainity Principle for the first time, I took a break...

He couldn't remember his other textbooks, but i really appreciated his insight 20 years later]It really bums me out since Feynman's writing really is beautiful and deep, and i see a lot of slightly unhappy folks picking up this book and having a hard time with it.I totally sympathize, because i felt let down that my concentration didn't flow with the page as easily, as I thought it might with a neat little hardcover.All I can say is that lots of people who experienced the Lectures in the day, some people were frustrated, and some people were blown away, and some experienced both.----All i can say is that reread the book very slowly and patiently, or borrow a copy of Volume One of the full lectures at the library and browse through them, an read the first 30 pages.and please please please READ, Feynman's autobiography firstSurely You're Joking Mister Feynman [Part I]What Do You Care What Other People Think?

The writing is easy, likeable, and clear, I really wish I'd been able to sit in on one of his lectures, those must have been incredible.

Clippingsphilosophically we are completely wrong with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws. Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas.From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics. This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric field and charges,The masses given here are the masses of the particles at rest. The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot be at rest.it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth.When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun.

I started to read it on the recommendation of a professor in Computer Science and because I wanted to ""like"" physics more, as opposed to thinking it's this hard, scary thing. To that end, it's worked, I like physics more than when I started. On the ""Easy"" in the title: The premise of the book is that, of Feyman's lectures on physics, these are the 6 easiest, digestable for a layman with little to no background in the sciences. So I listened to the first couple chapters as an audiobook. The audiobook uses the recordings from the real lectures and are awesome. The written version drops some of his character and jokes in exchange for clarity so it's nice to get both. Feynman waxes poetry about rocks and moons and atoms and how physics relates to other sciences and it's pretty marvelous. However, once at chapter 4, on the conservation of energy, just listening becomes untenable. There are diagrams and equations and concepts that required my full attention to grasp. I switched from listening to reading, to listening and reading at the same time, to asking myself ""at this point why don't I just watch the lectures on YouTube?"". I did that, and all was good. The explanation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics in particular would be pretty hard to get without looking at the diagrams but with them it makes sense, or rather, explains the consistent way in which quantum doesn't make sense. One thing I noticed from perusing all these mediums is that Amazon keeps track of ""popular"" highlights in books and shows them to you. These were far more prevalent in the first three chapters. I wish they made available (but understand why they don't) other stats because I would guess that chapter 4 is where people might have given up on the book. The title says these pieces are ""easy"", but the last few chapters require your full attention and some quantitative reasoning skills to grasp. It's not so easy that I could fully digest the ideas half paying attention while doing the dishes, as was closer to the case with the earlier chapters. Feynman also uses imaginary ""reversible"" machines to explain energy concepts and I'm still not sure I like that or really get what those are about."
797,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97017413-john,3,"This is quite difficult to review. I knew of Feynman (obviously) but hadn't read or seen his famous early 60s lectures before. This book exists as an introduction to the man and his teaching methods but I'm not convinced it does a particularly good job.Definitely don't read this if you want to learn anything about physics, some of the material is very dated (a lot has happened in the world of physics in the last 56 years). Some of it is still relevant but if you didn't know what how would you pick this out from the irrelevant? The blurb on the book says ""the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics"" and I would strongly dispute that.The book gets off to a decent start, the prefaces and introduction set the scene, they tell us that the lecture series wasn't actually that successful with only a few students present targetted by the material so it's hardly surprising only a few stuck with them. Lecture One (Atoms in Motion) is good, a nice introduction to Feynman's method and the subject matter is gentle and well described. But Lecture Two (Basic Physics) is a disaster IMHO, it's a complete mess with Feynman jumping all over the place and not really explaining anything properly and leaving the reader totally confused. Lecture Three (Relationship of Physics to Other Sciences) is very biology biased and spends a lot of time on enzymes. Other sciences are briefly mentioned or pretty much dismissed, geology and meteorology get very short shrift and only go to emphasise how dated the material is. Lecture Four (Conservation of Energy) is better and thank goodness for Lecture Five (Gravitation) and Lecture Six (Quantum Behaviour) which save this book as they are easily the best two and the best advertisement for Feynman. These last two lectures have the most interesting content and we can see how Feynman excels in explaining these difficult concepts.Overall the book hasn't inspired me to tackle more of Feynman's lectures although the final two lectures came close. There are better and more up to date explanations of many of the concepts tackled in this book. I think it's worth reading, it's a very short and quick read, but don't go in to it expecting to learn much physics."
798,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18566696-nitin-dangwal,4,"Richard Feynman was on my to-read list for a long time. I have heard a lot about his teaching methods. His crystal-clear thought that made him teach the most difficult subjects in the most easiest of methods. Given this, I had a lot of expectations from this book. And I was not disappointed.The book is a primer to anyone who wants to brush up their understanding of the basics in Physics. But unlike the books that we have studied, this book is not a bland narration of the concepts. Rather in your hand, this book is alive, with one of the best teachers of the physics speaking to you. Not one page of this short book is boring. And like a thriller, you turn page by page, trying to know what happens next. Almost every chapter of this gem of a book is amazing. But if asked my favorite, it has to be the chapter on Quantum Physics, and the explanation of dual nature of matter and the inherent uncertainty of the quantum world. I find Quantum Physics for one simple reason. It has confounded both physics and religious alike. So weird is the world of quantum that it makes sense to neither of them. For physicists Quantum Physics provide observation that throw everything they have learnt and beliefs down to gutter. For religious person, the quanta world is nothing short than work of devil, where the world has no order - something that they attribute to the god. And what can they so, so astonishingly is the world of quantum. Particles behave likes waves. But when you take a light source to see what is happening, they start behaving like particles again. Nothing is 'is' there. It is always they could be 60% here, and 40% there. Nothing is certain. Everything is probabilistic. Quantum world apart, I love the book majorly for one reason. It sews everything from the concept of heat to the concept of planetary motion in one single narrative. I think this is the major thing that the science education lacks in today's world. So much we have divided physics from chemistry that we don't realize they are the part of one whole story. This book fills this gap. Must read for a light and entertaining read about basic physics"
799,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89960099-john-doe,4,"Yes, it's very much an introduction. Mainly provide a ""big picture"" which chronologically connected scattered topics of modern physics, and most contents are basically high school physics stuff.But still, it's nice to intuitively connecting the dots in your mind. It's a quick read for me 😁 since I was kinda boost on physics in high school period, literally top grades in physics, favorite part was electric circuits design.If it wasn't for something random I would be the kid who loves physics and studied physics all the way up to uni, gradschool, and PhD maybe. Nevertheless I was a kid came across book with words like nuclear physics at age 5. Anyway, reading felt like a breeze after so many years literally disconnected with any physics stuff. Why I picked up physics again, because I need to understand quantum mechanics, and need to understand higher level mathematics in a physics way not merely arithmetics way. There was a lack of visual intuition in advanced pure mathematics area, I think catching up with the area of physics may be the key to develop intuitions.Another interesting point, why Mr.Feynman had a subtle distaste for philosophy?I think Mr.Feynman simply adopted the uncomformist attitude for both personal life and academic breakthrough, and most of the times the reasonings of the majority of philosophers were kind of absolute, which is the very core against what science at the age often adopted, uncertainty or statistical or probabilistic thinking, in other words, everything is by chance not that absolute as philosophers usually argued. However I think that's not a very fair judgement for philosophy the subject in general, nevertheless, the founding father of probability theory Pascal was himself a great philosopher, had profound work not just about mathematics but about thoughts for life in general. Besides, the very thought or intuition of every mathematics breakthrough IS philosophical. Therefore you can not be both anti philosophy and chasing revolutionary breakthrough in whatever area, instead you have to be kinda of philosophical."
800,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110560654-samen-yasar,5,"In the early 60s at Caltech, student interest in physics started declining sharply among undergraduates. Years of rigorous training in the basics meant undergraduates largely weren't able to engage directly with the most recent advancements in the field. To restore motivation in students, the faculty asked Feynman, already quite famous by then, to teach a course on introductory physics to the freshman and sophomore classes. The result was a wonderful series of lectures that was later transcribed and became what is known today as ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". This book contains only six of the easiest and most accessible pieces from that collection.The lectures are true to the intent. Unlike a typical physics lecture, where complex math and sophisticated jargon reigns supreme, Feynman's discussions have the bare minimum of scientific jargon and almost no math. He gets to the essence of complex concepts with just simple thought experiments and intuitive diagrams. It feels almost as if he is telling a story, when in fact he is explaining a rather complicated concept. Though he primarily focuses on basic concepts, he doesn't shy away from connecting them to more advanced concepts whenever he can. Since it was set in the 60s, some parts of the text pertaining to modern physics is a bit outdated. But those aside the text is truly remarkable.If there is any text on physics at all that I would gladly recommend to any fellow non-physicist, it has to be this series of lectures. The text's usage of simple language and the deliberate omission of math lends itself to a very wide audience. Anyone with basic high school level math and science background should be able to follow through easily."
801,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1848040-gabriella-gricius,4,"Why Read: I love physics. I honestly really truly adore learning about physics. The small caveat is that I'm absolutely horrid at it. Learning about how the universe works (not really why, as Feynman points out) is something that I am not particularly gifted in. But nonetheless, I love reading about it. Review: I picked up Six Easy Pieces an age ago. I thought that it would be a great book for me because as previously mentioned, I'm not good at the subject. The basics are most definitely something that I could use a hand in. Everyone has heard of Feynman's lectures, they're practically famous and so reading the first six ""easy"" pieces felt like something doable.Let me disabuse you of that notion. Much as I enjoyed reading this book, I didn't find it doable or easy to comprehend. The first couple chapters are okay, when you learn about gravity and about the magnetic pulls between atoms and planets - but then... then comes the quantum mechanics. Then comes the simple act that physic researchers are just trying to figure out ""how"" things work, rather than ""why."" Before reading this book, I hadn't considered that physics as a science is a bit of a test of experimentation. On one hand, we learn new rules by experimenting and assume they are true until something goes horribly wrong. On the other one, however, we just exist in a state of chaos - never truly knowing about why rules are the way they are. Talk about frustrating.I admit that in reading this book, I was frustrated. I wanted to know about why certain particles acted in the ways they did and... the answers weren't provided to me. Granted, no scientist has the answer so I shouldn't expect a ""Physics for Dummies"" book to help me. Still. It's a fascinating read, and it's not particularly easy. But give it a whirl, and you will be proud of yourself. Rating: 4/5 Stars"

The only reason it doesn’t get five stars is due to my own limitations of absorbing the material put forth. Feynman is a fantastic educator and communicator, and even my poor excuse for a brain was able to glean a much better understanding of the subject.I didn’t do well with Science in school. Looking back, I can honestly say it was an equal mix of my not trying hard enough, and my writing off scientists as ‘evil people against my religion’; a detrimental state of mind inherited from my family. I’ve never studied Physics at all, and still enjoyed this book immensely.I would suggest only reading this if you truly have a longing to understand the universe more. It’s not something to pick up as a ‘light, entertaining read’ for a vacation or airplane ride... And be prepared for SO many equations.I’ll admit, I’m definitely a Feynman fangirl now. I never paid nearly as much attention to any other science than Biology, and I’m glad I’ve found more areas of interest to expand my horizons. I have Mr. Feynman to thank for that. His words have lit up a passion in me similar to how I felt when I read Darwin and Dawkins. I’m not a scientist, a teacher, or particularly clever by any means, but having people who are all of those things; and that are able to explain mind-boggling things to me so succinctly; is a truly marvelous feat. I am forever grateful to the great minds of this world."

Feynman is a brilliant teacher and, he’s arguably one of the smartest scientists in the 19th century next to Prof. Hawking and Einstein. People also believe that Feynman would have discovered “The General Relativity Theory” if Einstein had not done so. I’ve watched some of his lectures & interviews online and i was very impressed, which is why i’ve decided to invest my money & time in buying and reading one of his books. I have to be honest and say that the book is not as easy to understand as one might think. It is not for those that have no physics background at all. I had difficulties when Feynman talked about basic physics and chemistry facts, it was too dry & somehow really complicated. It was not easy to follow up and to understand the content. But, maybe, i lack the minimum knowledge one must have in order to start listening to a great scientist like Feynman in the first place, that is a very good argument indeed. On the contrary, there’re beautiful examples in this book. His ways of explaining complex subjects with simple examples is phenomenal. - Moe xx..."

I was completely lost at some point after the atomic deep dive though, but for good reason according to Feynman, for “Things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale.” and we have to use our imagination when it comes to the quantum. I’m more interested to see how physics can be stretched to philosophy like the incessant movement of atoms and how our body is continually changing even if there are no outward manifestations.I added this book to my reading list after Naval cited it in a podcast I was listening to, walking towards City Super buying a perk me up afternoon drink.***Quotes:What looks like a dead, uninteresting thing — a glass of water with a cover, that has been sitting there for perhaps twenty years — really contains a dynamic and interesting phenomenon which is going on all the time.

Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces speaks about six basic topics involved in Physics in a good, enjoyable and yes in a basic yet comprehensive way. The first chapter describes atoms in detailed, their functionality. The second and the third chapter describe physics and its relation to other sciences, good stuff. To be honest, I think the fourth (Conservation of Energy), fifth (The Theory of Gravitation) and sixth (Quantum Behavior - undoubtedly the heart of the book) were the best chapters in the book. I will not go into details as I don't want my review to be a complete spoiler.Just about the last chapter - It speaks and describes ""The Double Slit"" experiment beautifully like I have never understood it before, very detailed. This one chapter is undoubtedly the gem of the book.I'd definitely recommend this book to starters in Physics as well as to the experienced people in Physics (though you'd have known most of it - you can enjoy Feynman's deep insights).I am looking forward to getting hold of Six not-so Easy Pieces but not anytime soon..."

Accessible does not mean easy, and the book finds a delicate balance to discuss the complex topics+ Very well written or lectured. This was an enjoyable read start to finish as I enjoy Feynman's unique way of explaining things. + Honest and sincere. Where we haven't explored theory enough Feynman will quickly conclude ""we don't know"" and ""we must then find out""Cons- Definitely have to be interested in the topic (duh) but this isn't a book to take a risk on. If physics and the way our universe works is not interesting to you, you will get lost in this book and be unable to follow along- the first half of the book is the real ""easy"" bit and therefore it's critical to consider what easy really means. In this context, easy for students of physics at university level. - very minor gripe, but the formatting of the book. Feynman will discuss topics and the related figure or diagram won't be until the next page; frustrating if you're genuinely interested in pursuing this as a learning resource."

If you're expecting the jovial, self-aggrandizing Feynman of ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character, you're not going to get him here. This is Professor Feynman cleaned up for the classroom, and cleaned up further for mass ""respectable"" publication.The most illuminating part of this book was by far the quantum mechanics chapter, followed by the very basic chapters on basic molecular structure and physical states. Weirdly, the most obtuse chapters for me were on basic principles of force and energy. The diagrams did nothing for me there. I think a static medium of printed words and diagrams is maybe not the best for that subject."
808,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115451775-melvin,5,"This was a great book to read. I read it about three or four years ago as I started to become interested in physics. I had had it recommended to me via a Youtube video by Simon Clark. Anyway, I read it while on vacation and it was really, really good. It presents physics in a way that makes it easy to understand without hiding the details. I must admit that some parts were a little hard to understand and concepts were harder to grasp at some parts of the book. I think this is mainly due to my then younger age and the fact that I am a non-native speaker. I do still recommend it to everyone though. The book is perfect for anyone who thinks that they might enjoy physics and wants a first glance over the concepts. It introduces the concepts of basic principles such as conservation of energy all the way to more modern, advanced concepts such as quantum physics (although briefly and graspable). This book has been really important to me. I've only read it once, but the thought concepts presented in that book has been with me ever since I read it and helped me a lot in school to understand new concepts."
809,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67149971-elizabeth-saunders,3,"	In reading the book, ""Six Easy Pieces"" by Richard Feynman, there was one primary thing that I noticed. I consider myself to be a little bit more of a history or math oriented person, and I am even more confident about that now after reading the book. Not to say that the book didn't do a good job of simplifying some of Feynman's key points in physics- I believe it does just that. I understand that I am not part of the ""target audience"" from the book, which is why I feel like I didn't retain a whole lot of the more complicated parts. 	The lectures were definitely geared for the top tier science students. Also, at times, I found it a tad difficult to maintain a consistent level of interest through the passages with more data-heavy detail, as you might expect from a science lecture book. As a whole, though, I would say the book was very informative and an interesting read throughout. My feelings for Physics haven't changed, but at least I understand a little better about what the science of Physics actually is. -Duncan Hicks"

Mr Feynman's arguably legendary way of explaining physics is enjoyably succinct, my only complaint would be that I felt it could have been a bit more detailed, say with the inclusion of more equations while still taking into account the introductory theme of this book. However, this is it and those who wish to know more will certainly take a look at the Lectures themselves.Highly recommended to everyone who is interested in an introduction to physics in general - this is a light read and Mr Feynman is indeed a special person to teach us! However, if you do already have a gist of the basics, a more detailed book might be a better option for you. It is still a worthy read though, because there is some magic to 
how
 Mr Feynman explains physics, uses associations and makes physics intelligible."
811,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5676383-krishna-sundarram,4,"Feynman gave a series of lectures to first year students in the 1960s and the ones in this book are the 6 easiest topics. I was already familiar with these because I elected to study physics in school, so what I really after was understanding what made Feynman such a good teacher. After all, I had been taught the same matter by different teachers, some of whom taught in the conventional way, one of whom was heavily inspired by Feynman (shoutout to Prof Raavi!) and had also read 2-3 different texts on my own. So I hoped that I'd be able to contrast their approach to Feynman's and see if I could learn the techniques that made Feynman such a great teacher.Sadly, I couldn't. I know nothing more about teaching than I did before I started reading this (I didn't know much to begin with). That's not to say I got nothing out of it. I have a better intuitive grasp of escape velocity (should come in handy if I ever play Kerbal Space Program) and I finally understand the significance of the double slit experiment and the Uncertainty Principle. Its a fun read, even if you're already familiar with the matter.I still think its possible to become a great teacher by reading all the lectures repeatedly. Someday, I might look into that."
812,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45118733-eduardo-montiel,4,"Interesting read, the examples where a bit more complicated than expected. However, I have terrible spatial intelligence in order to accurately visualize them. My favorite section was where Feynman describes the relationship between physics and other branches of science: chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy, and even psychology. All these fields can be described in terms of physics and he goes through the main findings of each field and how they advanced different areas of scientific research in terms of physics. It was really helpful for mental filing. Especially since he separates the categories. The examples on energy and the uncertainty principle were particularly difficult for me to visualize. However, the examples are a bit clearer when Feynman starts to summarize and synthesize the points at the end of the chapters. I would have liked a bit more information on relativity, apart from the tie in to gravitation and the speed of light. The uncertainty principle is fascinating, but I’ve read easier interpretations on the subject. "

Feynman does a great job of not getting lost in the weeds of mathematical proofs and uses examples that people can understand to help us comprehend phenomena that are difficult to wrap our heads around because the aren't observable. This is a great introductory series of lectures, I have listened to them a few times now and it has really helped me get a better grasp on several basic physics concepts. Definitely recommend this to anyone interested in physics that doesn't have a post-secondary education in physics (otherwise this will be review, which could also be beneficial) if you do have post-secondary background in physics then ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"" which encompass these ones but also go much further might be a better choice, this may just leaving you thirsting for more which the complete set may be able to quench."
814,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,5,"In particle physics, there is an elementary sub-atomic particle called neutrino with zero mass. But what does it mean for a natural object to have zero mass? In order to answer this question one needs to first understand what mass is and what it abstracts. On the one hand, mass represents a property of a natural object within the context of the space-time continuum; a kind of constant that determines the strength of attraction of an object in the presence of a gravitational field (or another mass). On the other hand, we have the uncertainty principle that stipulates inherent uncertainty in the simultaneous knowledge of location and speed; and thus, if an object has zero mass it then means its location is absolutely unknown and therefore it must always be moving. Thus, if an object has zero mass then it can never be at rest.Feynman uses these kinds of questions to explain things we tend to incorrectly assume to be obvious. It is in those questions where the essential knowledge lies."

Professor Feynman is careful to elucidate all the shortcomings of our knowledge, leaving many doors wide open for discovery and new information to guide what we know to be true.A short read, yet very dense as he weaves the tale of how important physics really is. I took three physics classes in high school and two in college, yet I feel like I am learning all these things for the first time. Feynman has this wonderful way of helping you see what is going on, to understand something rather than just be able to name it. The final chapter began to stretch my ability to follow his explanations, but I feel as though I now have a better basis for quantum mechanics (no matter how minuscule it may actually be). I hope to return to this book periodically as we discover more and more, to reflect on what he/we knew then compared to now and the future."

Really inspiring stuff from this point of view.But, as someone also interested in the actual content of the book, it was a great read. I've given it 3 stars simply because I was too ignorant of the basics to actually make any real sense of the chemistry parts of the book and much of the mathematical stuff."

It is really interesting!!!If you want to read this book, please just keep in mind that its chapters are extracted from the first volume of Feynman lectures on Physics ( that has 3 volumes and 52 chapters just in the first one ), and from different spots. So for example, in the last chapter "" Quantum Behavior "", I had to explain some technical words and/or watch some Youtube videos to get the idea and be able to understand what the author is saying. And that's because sometimes he referred to chapters that I haven't read yet or used some words that I didn't understand. But I think that it's a great way to start!Anyways, it is indeed a wonderful book. But if you are unfamiliar with physics, don't feel bad for reading a paragraph more than once and defining words that you don't understand. When you'll keep building your understanding slowly, you'll definitely ENJOY the book and be AMAZED by its content!"
818,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77962764-ishan,4,"Billed as a layman's guide, but more complicated than that in reality. It is, after all, an abridged version of lectures given to university level physics students, and Feynman thus assumes some understanding of advanced maths and some scientific principles. This can make it occasionally impenetrable for the average reader. For the most part, however, Feynman's explanations are enchantingly lucid and occasionally even poetic, and the reader is sure to come away understanding just a little bit more about how the laws of the universe work, even if baffled by the formulas. I certainly did. It might even make you believe in a higher power - though not necessarily in any religious sense. I found myself awed by some of the truths Feynman uncovered, and the explanations (or lack of them) that he provided. This is certainly a brilliant primer for anyone looking to understand something about physics."

(Oh, how I wish he could have had access to what we have available today! If he could've studied Hubble images! ) As stated in the preface, Feynman wondered if there was a way to expose undergraduate students of physics with the excitement of the frontier instead of boring them for their first two years. He wondered why if there was way to bring the excitement of relativity and quantum mechanics to incoming freshman. His experiment, these lectures, was a failure, in his opinion, but someone had to try. I loved reading these and will definitely incorporate some of these connections into my own teaching. My favorite quote, from page 103,""That the law of gravitation is true even at bigger distances is indicated in Fig. 5-8. If one cannot see gravitation acting here, he has no soul."""

But, don't be fooled by how easy things look in the book. In the real world, the ones who attended these lectures were not beginners who want to learn Physics. It was his peers and Graduates who wanted to get his perspective. That's his speciality. You know how Chemistry works and how we smell. But, when he explains the concept, we can visualize everything in a completely different way. The last chapter about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle was the best of the lot. I am pretty sure that even if I wanted to , I can never forget how Quantum Mechanics originated. The real life ELI5. Worth reading it again and again till you understand. But, you can ignore Chapter 3 a little bit. Missed his magic there. Overall, what do you care what other people think ? ;)"
821,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27677000-mariano,5,"Great overview of the core principles. A great job at unifying concepts that are usually thought as different things. His description of the principle of conservation of energy and its relationship to potential/kinetic/electromagnetic attraction computation is beautiful. The chapter on quantum physics gives one of the best explanations of the process, not trivial and some knowledge of imaginary numbers would be useful too, but still one of the best pieces explaining whats going on down there. Still to figure out/review, relationship of the Schrodinger's cat paradox and the uncertainty principle, the uncertainty principle at a macroscopic level, imaginary numbers, try to start observations on planetary orbits and figure out the math behind to compute trajectories, speed, mass, etc. Review the math behind pulleys and other simple machines. Review the Krebs cycle."
822,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15513160-tim-mccaskey,3,"I am a physics professor and had read parts of the Feynman lectures before. All reports of him being an excellent lecturer ring true.I tried to think about how to review this for non-scientists. This is a selection of six chapters chosen from the larger set of Feynman lectures - seemingly chosen for relative simplicity. But they're all over the place. I didn't remember there being a discussion of biology in one, and the quantum mechanics piece is (as they admit) more complex than the rest. I will admit, though, some of his double-slit experiment discussion was freshly insightful to me.I can't get it out of my head how these lectures succeeded and failed simultaneously. It felt like he just went up there and (in a clear and interesting way) talked. As a window into his thinking, it's interesting. I couldn't picture these pieces being a coherent part of a class."
823,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5126957-ted-young,4,"The title is misleading. The pieces are not easy, and Feynman considered his attempt to teach undergraduates a failure. That doesn't mean his wit and enthusiasm don't come across in these lectures, and the photographs of him teaching practically vibrate with his excitement. As one of the critics of Feynman's lectures on physics wrote, reading his lectures ""is like trying to drink from a fire hose."" Still, just because it's hard work, and because they're are portions of the book where I needed more explanation, doesn't mean that there isn't something exhilarating about going through the very start of physics with the best American physicist of the twentieth century as a guide. There's also something to be said for getting something of a glimpse into real brilliance. I learned some physics, though I've learned more from other authors, but this was more exciting."
824,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88199233-rick,4,"A really good introduction to physics throughout the particular, original and unique style of R.P. Feynman. It is easily understandable for who is familiar with the most concepts of science and physics in particular, but there are no great barriers for those who just don't have some primary base concepts. That's because Feynman writes not just about science, but about the humans behind it.And in doing so he manages to take out science from - literally - a glass of water.And this is the ability of a wise and valuable man, not just that of a super clever scientist (even if in this case both the two option corresponds to him and describe him).I advise everyone flow in the magnificent World Feynman is able to describe: it is just about some Beauty that can not be unrevealed. Everyone should know how wonderful is the world around us. Let YOU be free to get to know it."
825,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69411959-aaron,4,"Feynman's gift for explaining complex physics in a simple & entertaining way is on display with this fairly quick read. The diagrams are a bit outdated, but that is to be expected from a book that pulls its body from lectures that took place in the 1960s. While the introductory chapter does a great job, it is quickly undone midway through chapter two. However, I encourage readers to trudge on as the book does recover slowly in chapters three and four before ultimately redeeming itself in chapters five and six. As stated in the books introduction, this work is targeted toward a selected audience, that audience being those that are truly interested in pursuing physics and/or other sciences. This is not something you would want to read if you're just looking to dabble. This book has encouraged me to check out the Feynman lectures in their entirety."
826,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49435353-john-s,3,"""Easy"" is a subjective term. There is no doubt about Feynman's depth of knowledge and willingness to explain ideas. Like many incredibly intelligent people, he can often present ideas as obvious when a mere mortal like me cannot immediately grab them.As university lectures, these six easy pieces do create a foundation but I found often it was too high level and had to be taken on faith. Surprisingly, I found his description of quantum physics to be the most accessible of the six pieces taking very complex ideas and explaining them as well as illuminating the reasons for fundamental doubt. Frustratingly, he refers to future lectures which do not appear in the book.It is however a valuable publication showing a viewpoint drawn from extreme intellect."
827,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58618743-nazir,5,"Amazing, clear and concise book to introduce some of the pure physics concepts to the common reader. Though it is adviced to have at least high school level knowledge of maths, physics and chemistry. Otherwise it might seem like he's going too fast through certain topics. It's usefull to be comfortable with these subjects. Especially around the final two chapters when he gets into the good stuff (law of gravitation and quantum mechanics).Overall I'd recommend this book to anyone curious enough to get a basic view of the world from a physics perspective without all the technical jargon (though it has some. But they're properly explained) and maths. This is a must read for aspiring STEM majors."
828,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38008473-odyssey,4,"I feel that this book straddles the line between popular science and a physics lesson. It covers physics without resorting to mathematical formulae. This is the strength of Dr Feynmans knack for breaking things down and explaining it in the easiest terms possible for the audience. This definitely sparked the imagination and made me want to learn more. However, the lack of math is also this books weakness. Six easy pieces are taken from lectures and some of them presuppose previous knowledge that the reader might not necessarily have. At times I felt that I needed that extra bit of math with couple easy problems to solve myself to grasp the concepts a little quicker. If you are interested in science and thinking of pursuing physics this book would get my wholehearted recommendation."
829,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60965151-siddharth,4,"I was fortunate to be introduced to Richard Feynman at the age of 13 by my cousin who was an aspiring nuclear physicist. Reading the first chapter of Six Easy Pieces guided my decision making and I shortly enrolled myself into a science and engineering program. I revisited this book recently after recommending it to my girlfriend (a liberal arts student aspiring to switch to science) and realized how foundational the writing in this book is to anyone wanting to understand science. To the kids of the future, this should be made essential reading to grok that science is not about memorization and solving equations but about reasoning first principles. Richard Feynman is the greatest teacher and then a Nobel Laureate."
830,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63755245-gonzalo-fern-ndez-victorio,5,"The book contains some of the easiest/foundational chapters in ""Lectures on Physics"" which itself was prepared based on the lectures that Richard Feynaman gave in the 60s. It attempts to present Physics in an intuitive way, with little or no maths involved. It contains great pieces of intuition (the conservation of energy and its applications are brilliant, and the linking of physics with other disciplines is superb). However, there are other parts where one perceives it shows a bit of its age. For example, the quantum physics part doesn't mention the Standard Model nor its problem (obviously since the standard model is from the 70s). But again, this is a brilliant piece and very easy to read."
831,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55820401-massi,5,"It's not that easy as the title might suggest, because unless you have a great memory able to visualize everything, few chapters require to sketch drawings at least and to be re-read carefully. It provides an intuitive approach to the physic, very useful especially to understand the gravitational theory, demonstrating that with logic and reasoning it is possible to deduct the very basic pillar of the physic without recurring to formulas and equations (actually there are few equations here and there, but no rocket science involved).I will keep it on my shelf and I will read it again now and then as a refresher. "
832,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18211158-sughanthan,3,"This is a good book to create basic intuition for some physics principles. But I would have liked a little more clarifications on certain things. At various points in the book, I felt like I could use a little more explanation. In any case, if you would like to learn basic intuition of how atoms work, how quantum mechanics came to be, or what the uncertainty principle is, this is the book for you. Some intuitions and images that are talked about in the book are very useful in visualizing the concepts. The next day after I read this book, I saw water vapor and I started thinking about how heat is causing the molecules to bounce from the surface of water. "
833,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51229868-borislav-itskov,3,"I have no arguments against the genius of Mr. Feynman, nor I doubt his expert skills in teaching.My only problem with the book is that it's filled with experiments which are really difficult to comprehend by reading. By really difficult I mean it's practically impossible to imagine all the things that should happen when an experiment is done. It's better to watch this somewhere instead of reading it. That's why I though some of the lectures in this book are better to be done in a video format.Other than that, I learned quite a few things throughout the book so there were parts I enjoyed a lot. Just a book is not the ideal format for these lectures, in my opinion."
834,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4075352-pluton,3,"These ""six easy pieces"" are selected chapters from Richard Feynman's more serious The Feynman Lectures on Physics. As I'm not very proficient in physics, the ""easy"" pieces weren't that easy to understand. The beginning with everything made of atoms is still mostly clear, but the end doesn't help much with the understanding of quantum mechanics, even with Feynman's good explanation style. I guess there is no shortcut to learning physics seriously if you're on that path. :)"
835,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72636435-shane-orr,4,"Feynman was asked to teach some physics courses to freshman and sophomores at Caltech in the early 60s. This book represents six of the ""easiest"" chapters of those lectures, covering atoms, basic physics, the relation of physics to other sciences, conservation of energy, gravitational theory, and an introduction to quantum mechanics. Feynman uses great analogies and examples to make the material accessible, but it was probably still good that I remembered some of my basic science heading into this."
836,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29573615-gary-street,3,"I read this book on an e reader (Kobo). Big mistake. There are many graphic illustrations that are referred to but were far to small to be readable on my Kobo. If you read the book, buy the paper copy!With a MS in engineering I found much of what the book said to be a repeat of my college courses. In a few cases, where that was not the case, I could not decipher the related illustrations and was left somewhat in the dark. Potentially a good book for those that have an interest in this field. But don't do it it on an e reader!!"
837,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1723377-david-meyer,3,"Physics has long been the branch of science I've most struggled to understand, and this book did little to change that. With that said, physics boasts a long history of some of the most interesting scientists, and Feynman is a personal favorite. I had already read a few books about Feynman himself, and thought it would be worthwhile to read from these famous lectures of his. Of course, if what's said is true, the man was a performer in front of a classroom, and little justice can be done from simply reading his lectures. It was still nice to get a small glimpse into his teaching style. "
838,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10966492-ella,4,"A really interesting and entertaining lecture on the basis of physics. I quite enjoyed this, the only problem was that it was first published in 1963, which means some of the information in the book was a little out of date or behind the modern standards. There were also a number of references to 'recent discoveries' which were, of course, from the late 50s and early 60s, which held little interest for me at all. However, certainly in its day it would have been a brilliant book, and that it still mostly holds up now is a testament to Feynman."
839,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35461072-rayfes-mondal,5,My dad was a physicist briefly before becoming a teacher and I'm an electrical engineer with a more casual interest in physics that took AP physics in high school and engineering physics in college a few decades ago. I really enjoyed Richard's descriptions as several were not ones that I'd heard before. A few places got a bit dense even for me but this was a really enjoyable book. It's a little deep for the casual reader but still worthwhile especially the first half of the book. Feyman was a remarkable man.
