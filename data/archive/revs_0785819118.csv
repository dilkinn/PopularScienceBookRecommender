I hate it when I hear someone say that Darwin says, ""we come from monkeys."" because that is not the case.his theory is on EVOLUTION, not monkeys. all he wanted people to understand was adaptation and survival of the fittest is really a simple concept, and daily life- proves just that.his theories don't have to impede on your beliefs in God. he was a Christian man, himself, but could still see the science before his very eyes. give it a shot if you are intrigued by species changing, growing, dying, extinction, over time..."

2,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,3,"Charles Darwin changed the world when he wrote this book.I mean if you think about it logically, no other book has had such a powerful impact on the way humanity views the earth; yes, we have countless religious doctrine, but never before had there been a book that so drastically alternated our perceptions of the mechanisms that are behind our existence. I’m not talking about on a spiritual level, a level of ideas that cannot be scientifically proven or unproven, but on an actual physical level. These ideas weren’t accepted overnight, few things are, but over time they began to be more and more accepted. Even today we still refer to Darwin’s ideas as “the theory of Evolution” despite the fact that it is now empirically proven as to how we got where we are. It is, generally speaking, a culturally accepted idea. The fact that we still refer to something most accept to be fact as a theory is a phenomenon. It’s unusual. Contrary to popular belief, Darwin did not seek to debunk any religious beliefs. In fact, the research he carried out put him in constant confusion about his own Christianity. For a time he believed religion and science could work together; he believed that science helped to explain some of the ideas in creation stories, but eventually he stopped believing. He lost his faith and embraced the logical mind of the scientist; again, he didn’t seek to counter religion. It was just a simple case that over time he could no longer personally and logically believe in it: it could not be proved rationally. As a student of literature, as a lover of stories, history, nature and narrative, I find myself drawn to ideas of religion and science. For anybody to call religion groundless (I say this from my own agnostically driven perspective) is to divulge a massive lack of judgment. Without wanting to offend any atheists, or anybody of faith, we will never know either way which is ultimately right. But, I do most ardently think that we can only begin to understand what it is to be human by reading and exploring the ideas of both religion and science. They have both been perpetuated by man, so I think we owe it to ourselves to try and understand why. Some of you may have noticed how eclectic my reading tastes have become. I pretty much read anything. I have many reading lists-both shortlists and longlists- but four works I simply need to read in my lifetime are The Qur'an (I have a beautiful edition I picked up from a used book store- a late 19th Century edition), The King James Bible (I’ve recently finished genesis), Relativity: The Special and the General Theory by Einstein and A Brief History of Time by Hawkins. The point is, I think in today’s world we need to understand both religion and science. Both parts form a larger part of our society. Well, anyway, that was a rather large digression. I read the origin of species back in 2013 for the first time. My second reading was more of a gloss over of certain key ideas, and a revisit of passages that I flagged down before. The ideas in the book are obviously ground-breaking, though not the first historical example of them. But, for me, this book is more of a slog than leisure driven reading. The writing isn’t great and it is terribly repetitive at times, but I suppose that’s what comes with observing the natural world in such scientific detail. From the findings here Darwin would eventually go on to lay down his full arguments in  The Decent of Man,  a read that sounds more compelling and all encompassing. So it’s another one to add to my list!"
3,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dear Carol,Thank you for your mail, and of course I remember meeting you on the flight last month! It was a very interesting discussion and I'm still thinking about it. The semester has now started here at Creationist U and I am working hard, but I found time to read the book you recommended. And I'm glad I did, because it was really a lot better than I thought it would be.I guess I was expecting Darwin to be like Richard Dawkins, but he was respectful of religious ideas. And it was great that he liked Paley's Natural Theology so much... he says he almost knew it by heart! We read Paley last year in History of Creation Science, and I also thought it was a terrific book. So I could see Darwin was an open-minded person who was prepared to look at both sides of the question. Richard Dawkins could learn a lot from that!The way he sets up his argument is smart. He starts off talking about how stockbreeders can improve their breed - well, I'm a country boy, and I could see he knew his stuff. This is someone who's spent time down at the farm and understands how country people feel about livestock. And I liked that he'd done all that work raising pigeons. Not the kind of scientist who just hangs out at the lab all day. After that, he introduces his Big Idea about the survival of the fittest and he almost made evolution sound sensible. He's a good writer. And then he was honest when he explained all the problems with the theory. He really got me - I was wondering if he was going to mention any of that stuff, and a page later he came out and said just what I was thinking! Nice work, Mr. Darwin. But I did wonder what he was doing, cutting out the ground from under his own feet. He said he could explain things like the eye and how bees could evolve to make honeycombs, but even if he was real good at making his case, I wasn't buying any.So by the halfway mark, I figured he was done, but like ol' Dubya used to say, I misunderestimated him - he'd saved all his best stuff for last. He had some good shots! I got to admit, he made me think. Why does God put the species that look alike in the same place? Like he says, it is weird how you have a mountain range, and there's one kind of animals and plants on one side, and a different kind on the other side. God's ways are inscrutable to us, but why does He care about those mountains? And the islands, they were even worse. He says if you look at the species on a lot of islands, you don't have any mammals there, except you do have bats. Why? I could see where he was going with this one - the bats could blow in off the mainland and evolve, but other mammals couldn't do that. I admit it, I don't have an answer, except maybe God's testing our faith again. But I can see not everyone will like that. I'm still wondering about those bats! Okay Mr. Darwin, I said it already but I'll say it again, you were a smart guy. So how's life at MIT? And I hope you read the book I recommended to you. A Canticle for Leibowitz will show you that faith and science have more in common than you might think!Take care,Bob"
4,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3712181-stephen-m,4,"Edits for NR because I love him that much. This:""This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful not injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic.""We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change, and some species might become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would most seriously affect many of the others. If the country were open on its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. Let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up, if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area been open immigration, these same places would have been seized on by intruders. In such case, ever slight modification, which in the course of ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of improvement. ""We have reason to believe, as stated in the first chapter, that a change in the conditions of life, by specially acting on the reproductive systems, cause or increases variability; and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a changes, and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by giving a better chance of profitable variations occurring; and unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing."" (I DIDN'T WRITE THIS. DARWIN DID IN THIS BOOK.)Or This."

I'm surprised at how adapted we have become (or at least the segment of those people on the planet who don't reject Darwin's theory of natural selection as counter to their own idea of the way God makes and shakes) to Darwin's revolutionary idea(s). Like with many of the pantheon of scientific geniuses (Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, etc) there was a bit of random chance involved. The ground was ready for Darwin's adapted seed. There were enough scholars and scientists and rationalists around to carry his idea(s) hither and his theory thither. So while this book, and Darwin himself, were both stellar examples of scientific restraint, the force and momentum of OftS can't be under appreciated. It was just the right time and right place for a scientific revolution. Darwin and his little book walked by a labour of scientific mouldywarps who happened to find themselves on the chalk cliffs of science, pushed those sterile hybrids off, and never looked back. Evolve bitches!"

It's almost complete transcended its role as a seminal scientific tome and become a legitimate historic artefact. You can't review a historic artefact.This is a fantastic read, even viewed in a completely different way to how it would have been read at the time. It really is amazing how much evolutionary biology Darwin was able to formulate almost a century before Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA. It boggles the mind what Darwin could have been capable of if he'd had access to the last 150 years of genetic research."

It was sometimes a bit tough to read because of the depth into detail. If I were an anthropologist I'm sure I would more appreciate that detail, but as a layman it did at times seem too thick. If I were lost in an uncivilized world and had only two books, I would want a Webster's dictionary and this Origin of Species. The dictionary to learn word definitions and this book to learn about the flora and fauna around me. For all those people who get upset because you think this book may contradict another one you are so fond of, just be very careful not to fall off the edge of the flat 6,ooo year old earth......mgc "
8,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"Too much to unpack here and not an easy read as it was written 150 years ago. Despite all of the knocks against reading Origin for enjoyment, I can only express extreme awe and state the obvious - how much of a genius Darwin was. From his theory of natural selection to glacier theory, to hybrid plants, to fossil theory and a dozen other biological and geological theories that he developed or contributed to, it is remarkable to me how very little Darwin got wrong in a book that was 600 pages long. We live in a science based world, or at least we like to think so, and this man manages to remain so relevant. It is the scientific method at its best, one part rigorous logic, one part observation, and one part intuition. The recipe works."
9,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,4,"Decry or applaud it, there's no question this work has had a profound effect not just on science, but the culture at large. What I wouldn't read this book for is the science, or in an effort to either defend or refute the argument for evolution. The core of Darwin's argument certainly is still what was taught in my Catholic high school biology class (taught by a nun). In a nutshell, the theory is that given there are wide-ranging subtle Variations among organisms, the Malthusian Struggle for Existence causes by means of Natural Selection of the inheritable traits that are the best Adaptations to the environment the Origin of Species or as Darwin calls it, the ""theory of descent with modification.""But, after all, this book is now over 150 years old. Science is about explaining natural phenomenon and correcting mistakes through observation, experimentation and falsification--not dogma--and so is always a moving target. I know that. But I still raised an eyebrow when in the first chapter of the book Darwin said he believed the ""most frequent cause of variability"" was caused by the experiences of the parents before conception--such as cows' udders being larger in countries where they're milked because the habit of milking by itself alters in the reproductive organs what is inherited by the next generation. WTF Darwin? When Darwin first propounded his theory of evolution (a word never used in the book by the way) through natural selection, Mendel had yet to discover the basic principles of genetics in his experiments with peas and Watson and Crick had yet to unravel the structure of DNA. Nor was continental drift known and understood, so there were notable gaps in Darwin's reasoning that has since been filled. Stephen Jay Gould, one of the staunchest defenders and popularizers of evolution is famous within science particularly for where he differs from Darwin. Darwin thought changes in species were very gradual. Gould favors ""punctuated equilibrium"" where there are rapid changes followed by long periods of stability. That's why scientists today talk of the ""theory of evolution,"" not of ""Darwinism"" as if a scientific principle is an unchanging creed and Origin of Species scripture.So, the book is dated and filled with lots of details I'm sure are just plain wrong and might be onerous to unlearn. That does make me reluctant to give this book top marks despite its profound impact. Someone interested in modern evolutionary science would be better off picking up a copy of a book by Jared Diamond, Richard Dawkins, Carl Sagan (although by now I suppose his very readable Dragons of Eden is dated) or Stephen Jay Gould. So, was there no value in reading On the Origin of Species? I wouldn't say that. It's surprisingly readable--or at least understandable. There are definitely dry passages that were a slog to get through, my eyes glazing over as Darwin gave example after exhaustive example to make his points. However, I couldn't help but be impressed by the knowledge of nature shown by his wide-ranging examples from every continent from ants and bees and algae to pigeons to zebras. Given the way he cited various authorities and spoke about his own experiments, I definitely felt that here was a master generalist and enthusiast on nature. Moreover Darwin does have a gift for metaphor and illustrative examples. I was particularly taken by his explanation of ""inter-crossing"" and the function of sex in creating biological diversity. I also was struck by how cautious and civil in tone Darwin is in his arguments, devoting an entire chapter on what he saw could be the flaws and holes in his theory--particularly the issues of transitions between species and intermediate forms. Bottom line? Arguably this specific book had as much influence on the literature and politics of the next century as Freud or Marx, so I think there is historical value in reading this, preferably in the first edition (which is what I read) that exploded upon the world in 1859."

""If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from feeling the benefit of this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third stage.""
On the Origin of Species is one of the most important books ever written. Although a lot of people-scientists, naturalists and the like-were coming to the same kind of conclusions, Darwin was one of the first who wrote it all down in a profound and concise manner and used his influence and friends to make it a well-known theory: the theory of evolution.There is only one thing you need to know before you read this, and that is that Charles Darwin was a very religious man. This is a five-star worthy book, but my ignorance of this fact caused me to be so infuriated by the end that I couldn't bring myself to rate it higher. It is written exquisitely: if you've read anything particularly science-related in this day and age you will notice how science-related it is. The words, the terms, they're all very much science-related and it can be so difficult to really understand and comprehend what you're reading because it's almost in another language.This is written very much in the way any Victorian novel would have been written. There is a smattering of Latin terms, but for the most part it is easy to understand if you get in the right frame of mind as you would a Classic. It can be heavy going, however, as the paragraphs are long and often repetitive, but his thoughts on pigeons are the most endearing things I've come across: this is Victorian science and it's all about pigeons.To go back to why I only rated it three stars: throughout at no point did Darwin mention God or the creation of the world, except perhaps in very subtle reference and the theory of evolution and instinct reigns supreme, until the very end when he concludes that God did not create the world 1859 years, but millions of years ago, instead, and that all current flora and fauna are descended from the original God-created animals. I should have expected something like this but I did not and that annoyed me more than it should have. Of course, it makes the entire thing that much more impressive, though the horrific experience Darwin must have gone through as he tried to make a religious-belief co-live with a scientific frame of mind would have been supremely agonising. It's wholly my fault for this ignorance, but I still can't bring myself to heighten it.It's still one of the most important books ever written and its legacy will never become diminished, but it is often repetitive and sometimes out-dated with quite a lengthy part about geology which is fairly unremarkable, but his amusing and enjoyable experiments with flowers and his views on pigeons are just a delight.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy"
11,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"My book group selected this book for discussion probably because of the historic impact it has had on the field of science. However, I found it to be very worthy of respect from a literary viewpoint. Charles Darwin's writing comes across as a methodical thinker and patient explainer to many recalcitrant readers who are determined not to believe a word he says. He had me convinced after only a couple dozen pages, but he kept doing what seemed to me to be piling on observation after observation, explanation after explanation, until after a while I felt like crying out, ""Enough already, I believe!"" Frankly, I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge about the natural world already accumulated by the middle of the 19th century as demonstrated by this book. There are obvious things poor old Darwin didn't know about, one of them being the laws of genealogy discovered by Gregor Johann Mendel. Mendel was a contemporary of Darwin, and I have heard that a published copy of Mendel's study was on Darwin's book shelves but it hadn't been opened or read. Of course Darwin wasn't the only person who ignored Mendel. Mendel's work wasn't appreciated for its contribution to understanding of inherited traits until after his death. Meanwhile Darwin is writing this book giving many observations regarding the variability of crossings of various plants and animals, but doesn't understand why.Also, Darwin was plagued with physicists of the time who calculated that earth couldn't be as old as needed for Darwin's theory of natural selection to accomplish all the required changes. The physicists were basing their calculations of the rate cooling of the core of the earth. Of course they were wrong; what they didn't know about was radioactive decay which gives off heat they weren't making allowances for. It turns out the earth is even older than Darwin would have guessed.And of course the really big advance of science that Darwin didn't know about was the DNA double helix. Darwin insists that life forms need to be classed according to genealogy, and he speculates that in the future scientists will be able to classify life forms more accurately as more knowledge is obtained about them. Darwin would be amazed to know how precisely genealogy can be determined these days. For example, it can be determined that humans are more closely related to fungi than to photosynthetic plants.I listened to the audio version of this book. This is an example of a book that is much easier to listen to than to read because of all the big Latin words used in describing species. Having the words read aloud made them fit into the context of the sentence much better than if I were trying to read (and probably skip over) those unfamiliar words. There were six editions of ""Origin of Species"" in Darwin's life time. It could be argued that the 1859 edition is the second best version of this book with the 1860 British edition being slightly better in that it contains some insignificant, but non-substantive, corrections. The editions of 1861, 1866, 1869, and 1872 are all inferior. In them Darwin made changes and expansions in an effort to meet the objections that arose during those times. The modifications expanded the book and clouded the argument. Since most of the objections that were raised would be regarded as silly today, Darwin's arguments against them are of interest for social history, but not for Darwin's theory. I think that most published copies today are based on the 1872 edition. If you have an earlier edition you will find that it is shorter and, as indicated above, is probably better.The following quotation is from the sixth edition and not in the earlier editions. It is from a section of the book on instincts and follows a couple paragraphs discussing the habit of some birds to lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species. Mr. Darwin has just sighted some of the observations of the nesting habits of a type of cowbird [Molothrus Bonariensis] written by a naturalist colleague. ""Mr. Hudson is a strong disbeliever in evolution, but he appears to have been much struck by the imperfect instincts of the Molothrus Bonariensis that he quotes my words and asks, 'must we consider these habits not as an especially endowed or created instincts but as small consequences of one general law, namely transitions?' ""I take from the above that Darwin was enjoying the irony of a naturalist from the creationist camp finding it difficult to attribute to God the endowment of the slothful nest making habits to the cowbird. Since the behavior is repugnant it must have been caused by that old nasty evolution stuff (i.e. the work of the devil)."

Or, perhaps you are a student participating in one of nation's modern and progressive science classes, learning about the Origins of Man, but confused by the lack of scientifically observable studies missing from your text books.

13,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48327873-markus,5,"On The Origin of SpeciesDarwin (1809-1882)Darwin published this book in 1859. It is his scientific treaty based on the idea of all organism living on the earth to be descendants from one or several original progenitors.The work is mostly a transcription of the author’s notes throughout his years of study and his famous voyage on the HMS Beagle to the Southern Hemisphere. It had likely been addressed to the quite sceptic scientific community of his time, to demonstrate his idea and to bring supporting material enough to convince and to proof its validity. Apart from the excessively rich scientific vocabulary, the book is pleasant reading. A few quotations will give some insight: ""This Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements, and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence into my accuracy. No doubt errors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone. In considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryonic relations, their geographical distribution, geological successions, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties from other species.”The work is developed in chapters:Variations under Domestications,Variations in Nature,Struggle for existence,Natural selection; or Survival of the fittest,Laws of variation,Difficulties of the theory, Miscellaneous objections to the theory of Natural Selection,Instinct,Hybridism,On the imperfection of the Geological Record,On the Geological Succession of Organic Beings Geographical distribution,Mutual affinities of organic beings, Embryology,Quotations from Recapitulation and Conclusion: ""I see no good reason why the view given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of anyone. It could be just as noble a conception for a Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws. The belief that species were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was believed to be of short duration; and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are apt to assume, that the geological record would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species. Now, things are wholly changed, and almost every naturalist admits the great principle of evolution, over the old belief in the creation of species from the dust of the earth. The laws of Nature, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to the struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural selection, and the Extinction of less-improved forms. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one.”I have much enjoyed reading this book and am glad not to have missed it. I recommend it to anyone interested in Natural History or just in knowledge as such."

At times, it was hard getting through this book, mainly because it's dense and sometimes Darwin tended to drag and not get to the point, but I'm glad I finally read it. However, I think I should have read this at another point of my life - I mean, it was exasperating to read something I had just studied at a biology course I was taking. I still don't regret reading this. If you're considering on whether picking this book or not (yeah, I'm actually recommending it), I suggest you do it between your leisure reading because it can get tedious if you swallow it all at once."

I was never taught the Theory of Natural Selection in school but only heard it mentioned when some adults scoffed at it. Thankfully, my natural talents steered me away from a career in Biology or Genetics, so this lack of knowledge didn’t affect my career prospects. It just affected my understanding of the world. I learned years later the basics of the theory but this just piqued my interest about reading the actual book. I always have problems with Victorian authors (very long sentences) so the print version gave me some difficulty. If it weren’t for Richard Dawkins' excellent narration, I don’t know that I could have enjoyed this book as much.I’m almost shocked that I was able to follow the concepts herein as well as I did. I am amazed that Mr. Darwin could write this book (one of the most important in the history of science and the whole world) in such clear, concise way, that a person with minimal understanding of the topic in general could follow along so well. The concepts are explained logically with tons of examples so the reader is not left dangling wondering what he meant. Not only that, but he also writes beautifully and the prose is sometimes as poetic as it is instructive:As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.From the beginning, I understood this wasn’t a book I could listen in one sitting or while doing other things. I took it slowly and that allowed me to think things through. It made me think a lot about our place in the world and how sometimes we think we are above the system when in fact, we are just one creature among millions and not the most important in the grand scheme of nature (if we were to go extinct, the planet will continue merrily along.) It made reflect in our attempts to control nature, to see change as a bad thing, and our hubris that we can keep in check a process that has moved relentlessly forward for millions of years.Darwin was certainly cognizant that his theory wouldn’t be accepted immediately: “Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory.”  But I think he would be surprised by how much discussion there is still going on about the subject, specially given that DNA evidence has already proven he was correct in thinking that every living being sprouted from a single progenitor (mind staggering as it seems.)As I already mentioned, Richard Dawkins is the narrator for this audiobook and he did an amazing job - you could tell he's probably read this book a million times and knows it like the back of his hand. His diction was very precise and clear; and his enthusiasm for the subject was contagious. It almost feels like Darwin is the one speaking. Overall, a must read for anybody with an interest in learning how we came into being. "

Not because it’s poorly written, archaically worded, or just a boring topic- all untrue- but because the ideas were so influential that the entire book is just one big “duh, yeah, I’m already on board with this, you don’t need to harp on so much, I see what you’re getting at and I agree it makes sense.” (I remember a similar feeling with Singer’s Animal Liberation, for example.)  This is obviously one of those books. If you’ve got a high school diploma, you already understand natural selection, and if you’re interested in biology at all, you probably also understand the evidentiary support/finer tunings of the theory.  Essentially this is like, 700 pages of Darwin giving evidence for his theory by listing out different animals or plants and discussing how the variations imply a common ancestor/his theory and how they disprove his opponents’ arguments. Pigeons with X number of tail feathers, horses with leg stripes, radishes versus rutabagas. Lots and lots and lots of details about things like this.  I’m glad I read it because Darwin is clearly anxious nobody will believe his wild new theory, since he throws so much evidence at the reader. This serves, to me, as a fantastic reminder that this was, in fact, a radical kooky theory at the time and nothing in science should be taken for granted as truth because there is always, always always, a shakeup on the horizon that will make us question everything. And no era is immune to that- every era has thought itself “finally at the truth” and every time we’ve been wrong. As we are now, in ways we can’t even imagine yet."
18,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29868756-katie-bananas,5,"Celebratory 2:00 am review, just great!!! When I finished this, I was definitely clapping my hands!! This is not a story if you are one of those who are mad excited to read it. It's a tome of its size that is equivalent to an encyclopedia with depth, width, and value. It's the densest nonfiction I have read. It is an attempt to read a genre I really wasn't familiar with. Since I got into reading, I believe that nonfiction is one of the genres that is most daunting to me. In 2016, I definitely attempted a few; yet, I never really expected to grab this one off the shelves like that and just read it. It has an encyclopedia feel and it definitely reads like one as well. Charles Darwin is quite the familiar science genius known to students studying biology everywhere. He along with Mendel, the father of genetics, are the monsters for biology making it seemingly hard. As I mentioned above it's not a story, and it's not a simple read or a book for enjoyment. It is also not a list of drone. It's a rather valuable read of its size with historical touches and very good research on animals and all their genres with density and heaviness. The theory of natural selection as studied in class is not well explained by mere professors. I bet these clowns never came to attempt reading this. I'm repeating it's not a novel and a story you read for leisure time. Professors want to finish curricula, and that's why that's the part that's rushed at the end. I dreaded the study of kingdoms and phyla and Darwinism, because it was never properly explained.After reading this, I think my self respect and self esteem both grew at sheer, personal will while experiencing this book. Before reading, my imagination was always centered around the fact that this book is boring and I'll never find it on ebook. Now, I come to say that I was really thankful to my library for providing it online. Natural selection as emphasized, is the pure fact that all animals are picked out in accordance of their strengths and most intricate and distinguishable characteristics to build the up and coming generations. With this critical focus and specific selection comes variability. Variability is the guy who screams so loud, that for instance, a rose and an orchid are not the same, even though they are both very well known beautiful flowers to the sight of our eyes. Different species of dogs and bees evolve to not be the same. Each animal evolves to have their varied kinds and characteristics. I think of it as myself reading a book and loving it at the end. Did I necessarily love each page? Not necessarily, which presents myself as selective; however, I may have liked the book for its content or flow of a story, even though I didn't like a character or two, or even three. This book is my dense pride of 2016. It will mark my last nonfiction of the year, not because I had enough and finished a book; but rather, because of its mere volume, density, and pure heaviness. I intentionally took long breaks to go back and think what I learned, it really was a ton of material!!! This doesn't make it a textbook. It's an awesome encyclopedia full of potential with long lists of animals who were very well researched down to the hairs on their skin to state their merest and very specified difference, as to say: ""We are both redheads, but you specifically have this characteristic pimple or bump, which makes you slightly different"". Natural selection is a dense concept to attain and learn, because of how variability in the varieties are sincerely observed. I had mentioned that I skipped a whole chapter, which I ended up reading at the very end. It was the chapter on the objections against the theory. I was wondering why is this in the middle of the book, rather than at the end? I skipped it at first to first learn about the theory and various research along with all the researchers who helped Darwin writing this book with insights on their research. Objections, I thought came later. The reason why they came in the middle, I later on discovered is for the fact that these particular objections were not covering the whole book, but rather the first few chapters.It was very good, very dense, and a very important scientific classic. It needs a good amount of patience and belief in your progress. I have a different appreciation for animals and plants knowing that the best of its kind supplant all the others, making it really significant and absolutely striking. Seriously? Yes, absolute genius of a volume!! :)"
19,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1496261-cora-judd,5,"Richard Dawkins' narration of this book is excellent -- I enjoyed it immensely, however, without my semester of physical anthropology, the essential points would have required much more mental attention. Dawkins inserts clarifying information throughout the book and while Darwin's writing is wonderfully clear, I think more of Dawkins' notes and updates would have been an enhancement.I was surprised to see how diverse Darwin's background research was and how elegantly he wrote. He anticipated counter-arguments to his ideas and cleanly, systematically eliminated them. As he concluded each level of his argument, the gaps in his knowledge (due to gaps in scientific progress at the time of his being published) required that he make certain logical leaps and assumptions. These were especially interesting because he was invariably correct, as time has shown.Dawkins abridged the book to some degree which makes me leary - I want to know what the author intended the reader to know. And because the subject is still (astoundingly) controversial, abridging anything of this nature will likely invite criticism."
20,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2345961-pollopicu,2,"What in the world made me want to read this Goliath of a science book? My goodness! I guess if I had to search deep within myself I would have to say I wanted to read anything Darwin, just to see what all the fuss was about, but mostly because of the reviews I read on Goodreads. I thought The Origin of Species would turn me into the science-loving person I always thought lurked inside me.The main reason I finished it is because any science book that has had this much publicity deserves to be read and finished.First of all, it contained a considerable amount of text for a study which was only suppose to be a treatise. This book wasn't difficult to read, as many would have you think. It's not. In fact, it's pretty straight forward. But are you interested in reading 700 pages of things having to do with birds, aquatic mammals, cattle, beaks, gills, bills, plumage, fauna, fowl, pollen, eggs, and embryos? Don't get me wrong, I'm as interested to hear where we might have originated from as much as the next person, but if you take the book at face value, who would be interested in reading page after page of detailed observations of animals most of us will live a lifetime without even having encountered and if we do, so what. I say that as a lover of nature. I mean a LOVER of all things outdoors that have to do with looking at stuff, not reading about it. Where I live we often see herons, and gorgeous owls, foxes, snakes, etc, but I don't want to read 700 pages about them. I want to admire them for a while, but then keep it moving.From what I gathered, it seems to me that scientists and naturalists can't even agree on the differences between species and varieties to begin with. A lot of these studies aren't even conclusive, which makes a lot of sense now since it's a book on the THEORY of evolution. I didn't stop to think of the literal definition of the word ""theory"". Had I paused for a moment to give it thought, I would've realized I would be committing weeks to a treatise that is basically speculation. To me that's a huge waste of time when there are so many other books out there to read. Give me history or give me straight up fiction by topics on theory seem pointless to me. Also, the idea that Darwin's theory of evolution was indirectly responsible for the genocide of so many people during the Nazi era is simply horrific. I had no clue when I began reading this book that Hitler was a follower of Darwin's theory, taking it to heart (a bit too much) the supposed superiority of the white race, hence, making all other races inferior, and therefore extinguishing them. The Subtitle of The Species of Origin was suppose to be “The Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life.” Darwin referred to inferior races as ""savages"", and by savages he meant people with darker skin, such as Native Americans and Africans. Darwin, being the prolific and respected scientist he was, influenced many people (through his work) to practice prejudice, racism and oppression. Hitler believed that the human gene pool could be improved by selective breeding, very much like that of cattle in farm breeding, thus protecting the ""superior"" race. This is simply horrifying.In the end I'm glad I read this book, although I hated the actual reading part. Not so much because of what it contains, but because of the role it has played in our history, of which I was clueless about. In the frustration of reading this book, I made the effort to dig for more information about why so many modern day people are still fascinated by it, still not sure, but I did learn a lot from it, and it did inspire me to dig deep into other genocides that have been committed around the world in which this book may or may not have been indirectly responsible for. However, the book was absolutely tedious. It's like reading about a subject you absolutely loath, like sports, or construction. The part of the book that actually cracked me up was chapter XII (Geographical Distribution) because after having read what seemed like 200 pages of that, the next chapter (XIII) was called ""Geographical Distribution continued"", lol. At that point I was delirious and might have lost it. It's very rare for me to purposely not recommend reading what people consider a ""required read"", but this was a tough one. If you want to read it to add it to your library, go ahead, but I'm giving you fair warning, it's laborious like nothing you've ever read. You will have to see for yourself. "
21,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen,3,"3.0 to 3.5 stars. Not anything like what I would call a ""fun"" read, but I am really happy that I finally read this book given the tremendous influence it has had on the history on modern scientific thinking. The book itself, while dry, is fairly accessible and is not bogged down with overly complex scientific jargon. I would read a couple of chapters a day in between my ""pleasure"" reading and it made the book much easier to absorb. Definitely worth reading. "

And we should be proud that we are the only species that has figured out how we came to be."" ~Jerry A. Coyne, Ph.D., University of ChicagoOn the Origin of Species is Darwin laying out his theory of natural selection in precise, laborious detail. He knew quite well many of the objections and arguments this supposition would invoke, and he counters every anticipated antagonism with a barrage of evidence gained from detailed observation and/or astute experimentation. The idea that plant and animal species evolved from common ancestry was an affront to 1859 sensibilities and the courage required to challenge widespread, ingrained superstition and misinformation must have been enormous. And yet, here it is. The imperfect but substantial cornerstone of biology, biochemistry, psychology, genetics, anthropology, neurology, primatology, embryology... the list is immense.

23,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17891225-karnika-kapoor,5,"Not to my surprise, many questions that are thrown at Richard Dawkins by the creationist on debate panels have been answered as it is in this book. If only people read this by themselves!It was fascinating how the ""missing links"" was explained by Darwin in a context of geology. Most importantly he was indicating towards Tectonics (that was brought into light many years after darwin's time by Alfred Wegener). Clearly, Darwin was way ahead of his contemporaries. I knew it took him years to publish his work (arguably, partially because of psychosomatic dissonance), but the intense work on gathering information and years of research bolsters his point. He indeed wanted to be very sure of the theory. I am amazed by darwin's thought process that seems very instinctive to anyone who grew up studying about evolution ... however, being the forerunner in joining the dots on the same is very nonintuitive which marks his brilliance. Highly recommended to the Creationists. "
24,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21797839-rafael,4,"im just rating this 4 stars because of its complexity, but not for the contents of the book, witch can rightfully be called a piece of art, this has to be the most complex read i had in years, it's a beutifully explained book on evoulution of especies by natural and human selection, it is incredibly detail and meticulously explained, for maximum enjoyment you must know selections and natural order to fully understand this book as well as geography and different science studies, the variety of especies mentioned in this book is very wide and unless you have a picture of each especies or variety you would be fairly lost, this not a book to take easily as i wrongly did at first but it's an stupendous read if you love science, it is very heavy and will challenge you to finish it and is up to you if you do it, for me it is a really complex read but a fulfilling one in the name of science."
25,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"It took me awhile to drag myself into reading this one. People have always commented that it was so dull and that it was convoluted and hard to follow and I have always believed in evolution and found modern books very accessible on the subject so I thought why bother? Then again I have a thing for classics, and as my list of books on evolution grew I started to chide myself that I still had not even read from Darwin's own hand. So I bent to the grain and pulled it out. This book was nothing like what I expected. Absolutely NOTHING like what I expected. If you read this with an open mind, slowly and take each of his points into consideration you find an absolute flawless logic to his argument. It is well presented and actually I find that compared to many scientific articles it is clearly written for the wider audience. Darwin wants you to get it. He wrote as plainly and carefully as he could. He did not propose his idea half assed or hurriedly. I was floored to find that all of my favorite arguments for evolution came straight from the horses mouth as it were. Darwin got it. He really really got it. He went at it from every angle he could, geological time scales, fossils, birds, plants, animals, interactions, sexual selection, selection on islands, selection in various terrains. He broke it down bit by bit and said: Look guys, I hardly wanted to buy this myself but this is how it is. Just look! See for yourself. Make up your own mind. His methodical manner is hard to shy away from. He did not come up with an idea and let others run with it. He did the research, he talked to people, he took it from all angles and presented it in the clearest manner possible. Yes I have to admit that the writing was a bit dry, but the river of content was overflowing, and the proposal was elegant and clear. What a wonderful contribution. I am honored to have read this work and chide myself yet again for my hesitation. "
26,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22315959-morgan,1,"I can now truly say that, having read the Origin of Species, I find the theory of evolution to be complete and utter hogwash. Darwin never truly gives an explanation for how microevolution can realistically extrapolated into macroevolution. Also, when he brings up objections against his theory, he gives an elaborate excuse for why he cannot prove his point rather than proving it. I am still a firm believer in Creation. It is a lot more logical than evolution."

28,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6051061-t-d-whittle,5,"I know the world has not been waiting with bated breath for 160 years to hear my opinion of this marvelous book, but I wanted to add my praise anyway. This is such a beautiful read. Darwin makes his argument for descent through modification of all organic life with such patience, eloquence, and clarity that it's awe inspiring, especially when one bears in mind that DNA and its sure-fire evidence of descent had not been discovered yet. It's truly remarkable that Darwin was right about almost every detail, using only the tools he had to work with in the nineteenth century, his formidable intelligence, and his sparkling intuition. I understand completely now why he is considered one of the few dozen greatest minds of all time, since recorded history.Darwin writes like a dream. He is gracious to and appreciative of his fellow naturalists. He's honest about the limits of what could be known with certainty, and what could be only guessed at. This style of writing in science is a breath of fresh air from a bygone era. I found Darwin's exuberance regarding his subject contagious, and am including a some of my favourite passages below, so that I can remember them.One thing that made the reading a bit tricky is that I do not speak Latin and, even if I did, would not necessarily know the names of plants and animals by their scientific labels; thus, I did not even recognise the names of common animals in my own country: the kangaroo and the platypus! Given that this book was written for Darwin's contemporaries who were laypersons, I wonder how they would have known these names, or if they read Darwin whilst having editions of botanical and zoological binomial nomenclature nearby? I had Google, of course, but found it also helpful to keep charts of geological eras at hand, an excellent globe, and maps of the world reflecting things as they were at the time of Darwin's writing. ""It is a truly wonderful fact—the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity—that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group, in the manner which we everywhere behold—namely, varieties of the same species most closely related together, species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together, forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct genera much less closely related, and genera related in different degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and classes. "" (pps. 170-171)""All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together or separating objects more or less alike.But I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe the arrangement of the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to the other groups, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but that the amount of difference in the several branches or groups, though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which they have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera, families, sections, or orders."" (p. 404)""As all organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived on this earth have to be classed together, and as all have been connected by the finest gradations, the best, or indeed, if our collections were nearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical. Descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the natural system."" (p. 427)""On the view of each organic being and each separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable it is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we wilfully will not understand."" (p. 452)""But the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate steps. The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been formed, and great valleys excavated, by the slow action of the coast-waves., The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations, accumulated during and almost infinite number of generations."" (p.453)On the imperfection of the geological record: ""The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record. The crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made at hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on and unusual concurrence of circumstances, and the blank intervals between the sucdessive stages as having been of vast duration. But we shall be able to gauget with some security the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeeding organic forms. ... "" (p. 457)This passage is so eloquent, and yet I do not believe mankind, at least, has continued to evolve towards perfection. So sadly optimistic: ""Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction fo the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual. When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the past, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity. And of the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species of each genus, and all the species of many genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. We can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to fortell that it will be the common and widely-spread species, belonging to the larger and dominant groups, which will ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Silurian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection."" (p. 459)""Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."" (p. 460)"
29,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1528196-joe,3,"Having finished Origin, I am taking the liberty of adding a few comments at the top of what I posted when I first added it to my ""currently-reading shelf."" To the would-be classics reader who is a bit daunted at the notion of tackling a fourteen chapter science book written in 19th Century technical terms I offer the suggestion that the back half of Origin is purely optional and can be let go. The first six chapters are the most enjoyable. Four is the big one, where Darwin presents the big pitch, with One through Three being the wind-up to prep the audience. Six is fairly unusual in science literature, being an effort to admit problems with the theory and making efforts to address them. Chapter Seven, on instinct, is aumsing but not vital to the core of the work if your attention is already starting to wander. The rest that follow involve technical arguments that may be pointless to most modern readers. To follow why Darwin makes them one would have to conversant in the state of the art in zoology, botany and geology as it was 150 years ago. I skipped much of it.A few points readers with only a casual knowledge of science may take from this book- Evolution predates Darwin, whose contribution is actually the mechanism of natural selection which explains how it works. He also contributed another mechanism, sexual selection, for traits inherited for their value in obtaining mates. Darwin offers an unexpected chuckle in a quote from Aristotle which suggestive of an understanding of something very much like natural selection.>What follows is old commentary.I am reading this one for the historical value, not the science. A big joke is that people of a certain outlook do try to read it for the science so they can refute it. Silly. Origin is as about as state of the art on evolution science as Newton is on 21st Century string theory. Ah, well.What I have found interesting so far is the struggle Darwin goes through to make his argument in the absence of the kind of modern scientific language or terminology that would have made things simple and clear to his readers. Even more interesting is that Darwin had no clue as to the mechanics of inheritance and admitted as much (the discovery of DNA was a long way off in the future), and yet was able to work out so much on his own without that knowledge.Cool factoid: Darwin took his time pondering his theories for many years before suddenly rushing to get them into print. It seems that while he was taking his time another naturalist named Wallace worked out natural selection too...and then wrote to Darwin for help in placing his findings in front of the right experts! You know how the science establishment is about giving credit to the first one to publish and forgetting the also-rans who came to the same conclusions just a tad too late. One party gets into the textbooks of future generations, while the other is lucky to become a footnote.I'll post some stars when I'm done reading."

32,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,3,"Charles Darwin changed the world when he wrote this book.I mean if you think about it logically, no other book has had such a powerful impact on the way humanity views the earth; yes, we have countless religious doctrine, but never before had there been a book that so drastically alternated our perceptions of the mechanisms that are behind our existence. I’m not talking about on a spiritual level, a level of ideas that cannot be scientifically proven or unproven, but on an actual physical level. These ideas weren’t accepted overnight, few things are, but over time they began to be more and more accepted. Even today we still refer to Darwin’s ideas as “the theory of Evolution” despite the fact that it is now empirically proven as to how we got where we are. It is, generally speaking, a culturally accepted idea. The fact that we still refer to something most accept to be fact as a theory is a phenomenon. It’s unusual. Contrary to popular belief, Darwin did not seek to debunk any religious beliefs. In fact, the research he carried out put him in constant confusion about his own Christianity. For a time he believed religion and science could work together; he believed that science helped to explain some of the ideas in creation stories, but eventually he stopped believing. He lost his faith and embraced the logical mind of the scientist; again, he didn’t seek to counter religion. It was just a simple case that over time he could no longer personally and logically believe in it: it could not be proved rationally. As a student of literature, as a lover of stories, history, nature and narrative, I find myself drawn to ideas of religion and science. For anybody to call religion groundless (I say this from my own agnostically driven perspective) is to divulge a massive lack of judgment. Without wanting to offend any atheists, or anybody of faith, we will never know either way which is ultimately right. But, I do most ardently think that we can only begin to understand what it is to be human by reading and exploring the ideas of both religion and science. They have both been perpetuated by man, so I think we owe it to ourselves to try and understand why. Some of you may have noticed how eclectic my reading tastes have become. I pretty much read anything. I have many reading lists-both shortlists and longlists- but four works I simply need to read in my lifetime are The Qur'an (I have a beautiful edition I picked up from a used book store- a late 19th Century edition), The King James Bible (I’ve recently finished genesis), Relativity: The Special and the General Theory by Einstein and A Brief History of Time by Hawkins. The point is, I think in today’s world we need to understand both religion and science. Both parts form a larger part of our society. Well, anyway, that was a rather large digression. I read the origin of species back in 2013 for the first time. My second reading was more of a gloss over of certain key ideas, and a revisit of passages that I flagged down before. The ideas in the book are obviously ground-breaking, though not the first historical example of them. But, for me, this book is more of a slog than leisure driven reading. The writing isn’t great and it is terribly repetitive at times, but I suppose that’s what comes with observing the natural world in such scientific detail. From the findings here Darwin would eventually go on to lay down his full arguments in  The Decent of Man,  a read that sounds more compelling and all encompassing. So it’s another one to add to my list!"
33,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dear Carol,Thank you for your mail, and of course I remember meeting you on the flight last month! It was a very interesting discussion and I'm still thinking about it. The semester has now started here at Creationist U and I am working hard, but I found time to read the book you recommended. And I'm glad I did, because it was really a lot better than I thought it would be.I guess I was expecting Darwin to be like Richard Dawkins, but he was respectful of religious ideas. And it was great that he liked Paley's Natural Theology so much... he says he almost knew it by heart! We read Paley last year in History of Creation Science, and I also thought it was a terrific book. So I could see Darwin was an open-minded person who was prepared to look at both sides of the question. Richard Dawkins could learn a lot from that!The way he sets up his argument is smart. He starts off talking about how stockbreeders can improve their breed - well, I'm a country boy, and I could see he knew his stuff. This is someone who's spent time down at the farm and understands how country people feel about livestock. And I liked that he'd done all that work raising pigeons. Not the kind of scientist who just hangs out at the lab all day. After that, he introduces his Big Idea about the survival of the fittest and he almost made evolution sound sensible. He's a good writer. And then he was honest when he explained all the problems with the theory. He really got me - I was wondering if he was going to mention any of that stuff, and a page later he came out and said just what I was thinking! Nice work, Mr. Darwin. But I did wonder what he was doing, cutting out the ground from under his own feet. He said he could explain things like the eye and how bees could evolve to make honeycombs, but even if he was real good at making his case, I wasn't buying any.So by the halfway mark, I figured he was done, but like ol' Dubya used to say, I misunderestimated him - he'd saved all his best stuff for last. He had some good shots! I got to admit, he made me think. Why does God put the species that look alike in the same place? Like he says, it is weird how you have a mountain range, and there's one kind of animals and plants on one side, and a different kind on the other side. God's ways are inscrutable to us, but why does He care about those mountains? And the islands, they were even worse. He says if you look at the species on a lot of islands, you don't have any mammals there, except you do have bats. Why? I could see where he was going with this one - the bats could blow in off the mainland and evolve, but other mammals couldn't do that. I admit it, I don't have an answer, except maybe God's testing our faith again. But I can see not everyone will like that. I'm still wondering about those bats! Okay Mr. Darwin, I said it already but I'll say it again, you were a smart guy. So how's life at MIT? And I hope you read the book I recommended to you. A Canticle for Leibowitz will show you that faith and science have more in common than you might think!Take care,Bob"

This:""This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful not injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic.""We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change, and some species might become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would most seriously affect many of the others. If the country were open on its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. Let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up, if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area been open immigration, these same places would have been seized on by intruders. In such case, ever slight modification, which in the course of ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of improvement. ""We have reason to believe, as stated in the first chapter, that a change in the conditions of life, by specially acting on the reproductive systems, cause or increases variability; and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a changes, and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by giving a better chance of profitable variations occurring; and unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing.""

I'm surprised at how adapted we have become (or at least the segment of those people on the planet who don't reject Darwin's theory of natural selection as counter to their own idea of the way God makes and shakes) to Darwin's revolutionary idea(s). Like with many of the pantheon of scientific geniuses (Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, etc) there was a bit of random chance involved. The ground was ready for Darwin's adapted seed. There were enough scholars and scientists and rationalists around to carry his idea(s) hither and his theory thither. So while this book, and Darwin himself, were both stellar examples of scientific restraint, the force and momentum of OftS can't be under appreciated. It was just the right time and right place for a scientific revolution. Darwin and his little book walked by a labour of scientific mouldywarps who happened to find themselves on the chalk cliffs of science, pushed those sterile hybrids off, and never looked back. Evolve bitches!"

It's almost complete transcended its role as a seminal scientific tome and become a legitimate historic artefact. You can't review a historic artefact.This is a fantastic read, even viewed in a completely different way to how it would have been read at the time. It really is amazing how much evolutionary biology Darwin was able to formulate almost a century before Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA. It boggles the mind what Darwin could have been capable of if he'd had access to the last 150 years of genetic research."

If I were lost in an uncivilized world and had only two books, I would want a Webster's dictionary and this Origin of Species. The dictionary to learn word definitions and this book to learn about the flora and fauna around me. For all those people who get upset because you think this book may contradict another one you are so fond of, just be very careful not to fall off the edge of the flat 6,ooo year old earth......mgc "
38,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"Too much to unpack here and not an easy read as it was written 150 years ago. Despite all of the knocks against reading Origin for enjoyment, I can only express extreme awe and state the obvious - how much of a genius Darwin was. From his theory of natural selection to glacier theory, to hybrid plants, to fossil theory and a dozen other biological and geological theories that he developed or contributed to, it is remarkable to me how very little Darwin got wrong in a book that was 600 pages long. We live in a science based world, or at least we like to think so, and this man manages to remain so relevant. It is the scientific method at its best, one part rigorous logic, one part observation, and one part intuition. The recipe works."
39,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,4,"Decry or applaud it, there's no question this work has had a profound effect not just on science, but the culture at large. What I wouldn't read this book for is the science, or in an effort to either defend or refute the argument for evolution. The core of Darwin's argument certainly is still what was taught in my Catholic high school biology class (taught by a nun). In a nutshell, the theory is that given there are wide-ranging subtle Variations among organisms, the Malthusian Struggle for Existence causes by means of Natural Selection of the inheritable traits that are the best Adaptations to the environment the Origin of Species or as Darwin calls it, the ""theory of descent with modification.""But, after all, this book is now over 150 years old. Science is about explaining natural phenomenon and correcting mistakes through observation, experimentation and falsification--not dogma--and so is always a moving target. I know that. But I still raised an eyebrow when in the first chapter of the book Darwin said he believed the ""most frequent cause of variability"" was caused by the experiences of the parents before conception--such as cows' udders being larger in countries where they're milked because the habit of milking by itself alters in the reproductive organs what is inherited by the next generation. WTF Darwin? When Darwin first propounded his theory of evolution (a word never used in the book by the way) through natural selection, Mendel had yet to discover the basic principles of genetics in his experiments with peas and Watson and Crick had yet to unravel the structure of DNA. Nor was continental drift known and understood, so there were notable gaps in Darwin's reasoning that has since been filled. Stephen Jay Gould, one of the staunchest defenders and popularizers of evolution is famous within science particularly for where he differs from Darwin. Darwin thought changes in species were very gradual. Gould favors ""punctuated equilibrium"" where there are rapid changes followed by long periods of stability. That's why scientists today talk of the ""theory of evolution,"" not of ""Darwinism"" as if a scientific principle is an unchanging creed and Origin of Species scripture.So, the book is dated and filled with lots of details I'm sure are just plain wrong and might be onerous to unlearn. That does make me reluctant to give this book top marks despite its profound impact. Someone interested in modern evolutionary science would be better off picking up a copy of a book by Jared Diamond, Richard Dawkins, Carl Sagan (although by now I suppose his very readable Dragons of Eden is dated) or Stephen Jay Gould. So, was there no value in reading On the Origin of Species? I wouldn't say that. It's surprisingly readable--or at least understandable. There are definitely dry passages that were a slog to get through, my eyes glazing over as Darwin gave example after exhaustive example to make his points. However, I couldn't help but be impressed by the knowledge of nature shown by his wide-ranging examples from every continent from ants and bees and algae to pigeons to zebras. Given the way he cited various authorities and spoke about his own experiments, I definitely felt that here was a master generalist and enthusiast on nature. Moreover Darwin does have a gift for metaphor and illustrative examples. I was particularly taken by his explanation of ""inter-crossing"" and the function of sex in creating biological diversity. I also was struck by how cautious and civil in tone Darwin is in his arguments, devoting an entire chapter on what he saw could be the flaws and holes in his theory--particularly the issues of transitions between species and intermediate forms. Bottom line? Arguably this specific book had as much influence on the literature and politics of the next century as Freud or Marx, so I think there is historical value in reading this, preferably in the first edition (which is what I read) that exploded upon the world in 1859."

""If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from feeling the benefit of this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third stage.""
On the Origin of Species is one of the most important books ever written. Although a lot of people-scientists, naturalists and the like-were coming to the same kind of conclusions, Darwin was one of the first who wrote it all down in a profound and concise manner and used his influence and friends to make it a well-known theory: the theory of evolution.There is only one thing you need to know before you read this, and that is that Charles Darwin was a very religious man. This is a five-star worthy book, but my ignorance of this fact caused me to be so infuriated by the end that I couldn't bring myself to rate it higher. It is written exquisitely: if you've read anything particularly science-related in this day and age you will notice how science-related it is. The words, the terms, they're all very much science-related and it can be so difficult to really understand and comprehend what you're reading because it's almost in another language.This is written very much in the way any Victorian novel would have been written. There is a smattering of Latin terms, but for the most part it is easy to understand if you get in the right frame of mind as you would a Classic. It can be heavy going, however, as the paragraphs are long and often repetitive, but his thoughts on pigeons are the most endearing things I've come across: this is Victorian science and it's all about pigeons.To go back to why I only rated it three stars: throughout at no point did Darwin mention God or the creation of the world, except perhaps in very subtle reference and the theory of evolution and instinct reigns supreme, until the very end when he concludes that God did not create the world 1859 years, but millions of years ago, instead, and that all current flora and fauna are descended from the original God-created animals. I should have expected something like this but I did not and that annoyed me more than it should have. Of course, it makes the entire thing that much more impressive, though the horrific experience Darwin must have gone through as he tried to make a religious-belief co-live with a scientific frame of mind would have been supremely agonising. It's wholly my fault for this ignorance, but I still can't bring myself to heighten it.It's still one of the most important books ever written and its legacy will never become diminished, but it is often repetitive and sometimes out-dated with quite a lengthy part about geology which is fairly unremarkable, but his amusing and enjoyable experiments with flowers and his views on pigeons are just a delight.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy"
41,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"My book group selected this book for discussion probably because of the historic impact it has had on the field of science. However, I found it to be very worthy of respect from a literary viewpoint. Charles Darwin's writing comes across as a methodical thinker and patient explainer to many recalcitrant readers who are determined not to believe a word he says. He had me convinced after only a couple dozen pages, but he kept doing what seemed to me to be piling on observation after observation, explanation after explanation, until after a while I felt like crying out, ""Enough already, I believe!"" Frankly, I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge about the natural world already accumulated by the middle of the 19th century as demonstrated by this book. There are obvious things poor old Darwin didn't know about, one of them being the laws of genealogy discovered by Gregor Johann Mendel. Mendel was a contemporary of Darwin, and I have heard that a published copy of Mendel's study was on Darwin's book shelves but it hadn't been opened or read. Of course Darwin wasn't the only person who ignored Mendel. Mendel's work wasn't appreciated for its contribution to understanding of inherited traits until after his death. Meanwhile Darwin is writing this book giving many observations regarding the variability of crossings of various plants and animals, but doesn't understand why.Also, Darwin was plagued with physicists of the time who calculated that earth couldn't be as old as needed for Darwin's theory of natural selection to accomplish all the required changes. The physicists were basing their calculations of the rate cooling of the core of the earth. Of course they were wrong; what they didn't know about was radioactive decay which gives off heat they weren't making allowances for. It turns out the earth is even older than Darwin would have guessed.And of course the really big advance of science that Darwin didn't know about was the DNA double helix. Darwin insists that life forms need to be classed according to genealogy, and he speculates that in the future scientists will be able to classify life forms more accurately as more knowledge is obtained about them. Darwin would be amazed to know how precisely genealogy can be determined these days. For example, it can be determined that humans are more closely related to fungi than to photosynthetic plants.I listened to the audio version of this book. This is an example of a book that is much easier to listen to than to read because of all the big Latin words used in describing species. Having the words read aloud made them fit into the context of the sentence much better than if I were trying to read (and probably skip over) those unfamiliar words. There were six editions of ""Origin of Species"" in Darwin's life time. It could be argued that the 1859 edition is the second best version of this book with the 1860 British edition being slightly better in that it contains some insignificant, but non-substantive, corrections. The editions of 1861, 1866, 1869, and 1872 are all inferior. In them Darwin made changes and expansions in an effort to meet the objections that arose during those times. The modifications expanded the book and clouded the argument. Since most of the objections that were raised would be regarded as silly today, Darwin's arguments against them are of interest for social history, but not for Darwin's theory. I think that most published copies today are based on the 1872 edition. If you have an earlier edition you will find that it is shorter and, as indicated above, is probably better.The following quotation is from the sixth edition and not in the earlier editions. It is from a section of the book on instincts and follows a couple paragraphs discussing the habit of some birds to lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species. Mr. Darwin has just sighted some of the observations of the nesting habits of a type of cowbird [Molothrus Bonariensis] written by a naturalist colleague. ""Mr. Hudson is a strong disbeliever in evolution, but he appears to have been much struck by the imperfect instincts of the Molothrus Bonariensis that he quotes my words and asks, 'must we consider these habits not as an especially endowed or created instincts but as small consequences of one general law, namely transitions?' ""I take from the above that Darwin was enjoying the irony of a naturalist from the creationist camp finding it difficult to attribute to God the endowment of the slothful nest making habits to the cowbird. Since the behavior is repugnant it must have been caused by that old nasty evolution stuff (i.e. the work of the devil)."

Or, perhaps you are a student participating in one of nation's modern and progressive science classes, learning about the Origins of Man, but confused by the lack of scientifically observable studies missing from your text books.

It is his scientific treaty based on the idea of all organism living on the earth to be descendants from one or several original progenitors.The work is mostly a transcription of the author’s notes throughout his years of study and his famous voyage on the HMS Beagle to the Southern Hemisphere. It had likely been addressed to the quite sceptic scientific community of his time, to demonstrate his idea and to bring supporting material enough to convince and to proof its validity. Apart from the excessively rich scientific vocabulary, the book is pleasant reading. A few quotations will give some insight: ""This Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements, and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence into my accuracy. No doubt errors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone. In considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryonic relations, their geographical distribution, geological successions, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties from other species.”The work is developed in chapters:Variations under Domestications,Variations in Nature,Struggle for existence,Natural selection; or Survival of the fittest,Laws of variation,Difficulties of the theory, Miscellaneous objections to the theory of Natural Selection,Instinct,Hybridism,On the imperfection of the Geological Record,On the Geological Succession of Organic Beings Geographical distribution,Mutual affinities of organic beings, Embryology,Quotations from Recapitulation and Conclusion: ""I see no good reason why the view given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of anyone. It could be just as noble a conception for a Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws. The belief that species were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was believed to be of short duration; and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are apt to assume, that the geological record would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species. Now, things are wholly changed, and almost every naturalist admits the great principle of evolution, over the old belief in the creation of species from the dust of the earth. The laws of Nature, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to the struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural selection, and the Extinction of less-improved forms. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one.”I have much enjoyed reading this book and am glad not to have missed it. I recommend it to anyone interested in Natural History or just in knowledge as such."

At times, it was hard getting through this book, mainly because it's dense and sometimes Darwin tended to drag and not get to the point, but I'm glad I finally read it. However, I think I should have read this at another point of my life - I mean, it was exasperating to read something I had just studied at a biology course I was taking. I still don't regret reading this. If you're considering on whether picking this book or not (yeah, I'm actually recommending it), I suggest you do it between your leisure reading because it can get tedious if you swallow it all at once."

46,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/210123-d-g,5,"My science education left a lot to be desired. I was never taught the Theory of Natural Selection in school but only heard it mentioned when some adults scoffed at it. Thankfully, my natural talents steered me away from a career in Biology or Genetics, so this lack of knowledge didn’t affect my career prospects. It just affected my understanding of the world. I learned years later the basics of the theory but this just piqued my interest about reading the actual book. I always have problems with Victorian authors (very long sentences) so the print version gave me some difficulty. If it weren’t for Richard Dawkins' excellent narration, I don’t know that I could have enjoyed this book as much.I’m almost shocked that I was able to follow the concepts herein as well as I did. I am amazed that Mr. Darwin could write this book (one of the most important in the history of science and the whole world) in such clear, concise way, that a person with minimal understanding of the topic in general could follow along so well. The concepts are explained logically with tons of examples so the reader is not left dangling wondering what he meant. Not only that, but he also writes beautifully and the prose is sometimes as poetic as it is instructive:As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.From the beginning, I understood this wasn’t a book I could listen in one sitting or while doing other things. I took it slowly and that allowed me to think things through. It made me think a lot about our place in the world and how sometimes we think we are above the system when in fact, we are just one creature among millions and not the most important in the grand scheme of nature (if we were to go extinct, the planet will continue merrily along.) It made reflect in our attempts to control nature, to see change as a bad thing, and our hubris that we can keep in check a process that has moved relentlessly forward for millions of years.Darwin was certainly cognizant that his theory wouldn’t be accepted immediately: “Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory.”  But I think he would be surprised by how much discussion there is still going on about the subject, specially given that DNA evidence has already proven he was correct in thinking that every living being sprouted from a single progenitor (mind staggering as it seems.)As I already mentioned, Richard Dawkins is the narrator for this audiobook and he did an amazing job - you could tell he's probably read this book a million times and knows it like the back of his hand. His diction was very precise and clear; and his enthusiasm for the subject was contagious. It almost feels like Darwin is the one speaking. Overall, a must read for anybody with an interest in learning how we came into being. "

Not because it’s poorly written, archaically worded, or just a boring topic- all untrue- but because the ideas were so influential that the entire book is just one big “duh, yeah, I’m already on board with this, you don’t need to harp on so much, I see what you’re getting at and I agree it makes sense.” (I remember a similar feeling with Singer’s Animal Liberation, for example.)  This is obviously one of those books. If you’ve got a high school diploma, you already understand natural selection, and if you’re interested in biology at all, you probably also understand the evidentiary support/finer tunings of the theory.  Essentially this is like, 700 pages of Darwin giving evidence for his theory by listing out different animals or plants and discussing how the variations imply a common ancestor/his theory and how they disprove his opponents’ arguments. Pigeons with X number of tail feathers, horses with leg stripes, radishes versus rutabagas. Lots and lots and lots of details about things like this.  I’m glad I read it because Darwin is clearly anxious nobody will believe his wild new theory, since he throws so much evidence at the reader. This serves, to me, as a fantastic reminder that this was, in fact, a radical kooky theory at the time and nothing in science should be taken for granted as truth because there is always, always always, a shakeup on the horizon that will make us question everything. And no era is immune to that- every era has thought itself “finally at the truth” and every time we’ve been wrong. As we are now, in ways we can’t even imagine yet."
48,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29868756-katie-bananas,5,"Celebratory 2:00 am review, just great!!! When I finished this, I was definitely clapping my hands!! This is not a story if you are one of those who are mad excited to read it. It's a tome of its size that is equivalent to an encyclopedia with depth, width, and value. It's the densest nonfiction I have read. It is an attempt to read a genre I really wasn't familiar with. Since I got into reading, I believe that nonfiction is one of the genres that is most daunting to me. In 2016, I definitely attempted a few; yet, I never really expected to grab this one off the shelves like that and just read it. It has an encyclopedia feel and it definitely reads like one as well. Charles Darwin is quite the familiar science genius known to students studying biology everywhere. He along with Mendel, the father of genetics, are the monsters for biology making it seemingly hard. As I mentioned above it's not a story, and it's not a simple read or a book for enjoyment. It is also not a list of drone. It's a rather valuable read of its size with historical touches and very good research on animals and all their genres with density and heaviness. The theory of natural selection as studied in class is not well explained by mere professors. I bet these clowns never came to attempt reading this. I'm repeating it's not a novel and a story you read for leisure time. Professors want to finish curricula, and that's why that's the part that's rushed at the end. I dreaded the study of kingdoms and phyla and Darwinism, because it was never properly explained.After reading this, I think my self respect and self esteem both grew at sheer, personal will while experiencing this book. Before reading, my imagination was always centered around the fact that this book is boring and I'll never find it on ebook. Now, I come to say that I was really thankful to my library for providing it online. Natural selection as emphasized, is the pure fact that all animals are picked out in accordance of their strengths and most intricate and distinguishable characteristics to build the up and coming generations. With this critical focus and specific selection comes variability. Variability is the guy who screams so loud, that for instance, a rose and an orchid are not the same, even though they are both very well known beautiful flowers to the sight of our eyes. Different species of dogs and bees evolve to not be the same. Each animal evolves to have their varied kinds and characteristics. I think of it as myself reading a book and loving it at the end. Did I necessarily love each page? Not necessarily, which presents myself as selective; however, I may have liked the book for its content or flow of a story, even though I didn't like a character or two, or even three. This book is my dense pride of 2016. It will mark my last nonfiction of the year, not because I had enough and finished a book; but rather, because of its mere volume, density, and pure heaviness. I intentionally took long breaks to go back and think what I learned, it really was a ton of material!!! This doesn't make it a textbook. It's an awesome encyclopedia full of potential with long lists of animals who were very well researched down to the hairs on their skin to state their merest and very specified difference, as to say: ""We are both redheads, but you specifically have this characteristic pimple or bump, which makes you slightly different"". Natural selection is a dense concept to attain and learn, because of how variability in the varieties are sincerely observed. I had mentioned that I skipped a whole chapter, which I ended up reading at the very end. It was the chapter on the objections against the theory. I was wondering why is this in the middle of the book, rather than at the end? I skipped it at first to first learn about the theory and various research along with all the researchers who helped Darwin writing this book with insights on their research. Objections, I thought came later. The reason why they came in the middle, I later on discovered is for the fact that these particular objections were not covering the whole book, but rather the first few chapters.It was very good, very dense, and a very important scientific classic. It needs a good amount of patience and belief in your progress. I have a different appreciation for animals and plants knowing that the best of its kind supplant all the others, making it really significant and absolutely striking. Seriously? Yes, absolute genius of a volume!! :)"
49,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1496261-cora-judd,5,"Richard Dawkins' narration of this book is excellent -- I enjoyed it immensely, however, without my semester of physical anthropology, the essential points would have required much more mental attention. Dawkins inserts clarifying information throughout the book and while Darwin's writing is wonderfully clear, I think more of Dawkins' notes and updates would have been an enhancement.I was surprised to see how diverse Darwin's background research was and how elegantly he wrote. He anticipated counter-arguments to his ideas and cleanly, systematically eliminated them. As he concluded each level of his argument, the gaps in his knowledge (due to gaps in scientific progress at the time of his being published) required that he make certain logical leaps and assumptions. These were especially interesting because he was invariably correct, as time has shown.Dawkins abridged the book to some degree which makes me leary - I want to know what the author intended the reader to know. And because the subject is still (astoundingly) controversial, abridging anything of this nature will likely invite criticism."
50,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2345961-pollopicu,2,"What in the world made me want to read this Goliath of a science book? My goodness! I guess if I had to search deep within myself I would have to say I wanted to read anything Darwin, just to see what all the fuss was about, but mostly because of the reviews I read on Goodreads. I thought The Origin of Species would turn me into the science-loving person I always thought lurked inside me.The main reason I finished it is because any science book that has had this much publicity deserves to be read and finished.First of all, it contained a considerable amount of text for a study which was only suppose to be a treatise. This book wasn't difficult to read, as many would have you think. It's not. In fact, it's pretty straight forward. But are you interested in reading 700 pages of things having to do with birds, aquatic mammals, cattle, beaks, gills, bills, plumage, fauna, fowl, pollen, eggs, and embryos? Don't get me wrong, I'm as interested to hear where we might have originated from as much as the next person, but if you take the book at face value, who would be interested in reading page after page of detailed observations of animals most of us will live a lifetime without even having encountered and if we do, so what. I say that as a lover of nature. I mean a LOVER of all things outdoors that have to do with looking at stuff, not reading about it. Where I live we often see herons, and gorgeous owls, foxes, snakes, etc, but I don't want to read 700 pages about them. I want to admire them for a while, but then keep it moving.From what I gathered, it seems to me that scientists and naturalists can't even agree on the differences between species and varieties to begin with. A lot of these studies aren't even conclusive, which makes a lot of sense now since it's a book on the THEORY of evolution. I didn't stop to think of the literal definition of the word ""theory"". Had I paused for a moment to give it thought, I would've realized I would be committing weeks to a treatise that is basically speculation. To me that's a huge waste of time when there are so many other books out there to read. Give me history or give me straight up fiction by topics on theory seem pointless to me. Also, the idea that Darwin's theory of evolution was indirectly responsible for the genocide of so many people during the Nazi era is simply horrific. I had no clue when I began reading this book that Hitler was a follower of Darwin's theory, taking it to heart (a bit too much) the supposed superiority of the white race, hence, making all other races inferior, and therefore extinguishing them. The Subtitle of The Species of Origin was suppose to be “The Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life.” Darwin referred to inferior races as ""savages"", and by savages he meant people with darker skin, such as Native Americans and Africans. Darwin, being the prolific and respected scientist he was, influenced many people (through his work) to practice prejudice, racism and oppression. Hitler believed that the human gene pool could be improved by selective breeding, very much like that of cattle in farm breeding, thus protecting the ""superior"" race. This is simply horrifying.In the end I'm glad I read this book, although I hated the actual reading part. Not so much because of what it contains, but because of the role it has played in our history, of which I was clueless about. In the frustration of reading this book, I made the effort to dig for more information about why so many modern day people are still fascinated by it, still not sure, but I did learn a lot from it, and it did inspire me to dig deep into other genocides that have been committed around the world in which this book may or may not have been indirectly responsible for. However, the book was absolutely tedious. It's like reading about a subject you absolutely loath, like sports, or construction. The part of the book that actually cracked me up was chapter XII (Geographical Distribution) because after having read what seemed like 200 pages of that, the next chapter (XIII) was called ""Geographical Distribution continued"", lol. At that point I was delirious and might have lost it. It's very rare for me to purposely not recommend reading what people consider a ""required read"", but this was a tough one. If you want to read it to add it to your library, go ahead, but I'm giving you fair warning, it's laborious like nothing you've ever read. You will have to see for yourself. "
51,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen,3,"3.0 to 3.5 stars. Not anything like what I would call a ""fun"" read, but I am really happy that I finally read this book given the tremendous influence it has had on the history on modern scientific thinking. The book itself, while dry, is fairly accessible and is not bogged down with overly complex scientific jargon. I would read a couple of chapters a day in between my ""pleasure"" reading and it made the book much easier to absorb. Definitely worth reading. "

And we should be proud that we are the only species that has figured out how we came to be."" ~Jerry A. Coyne, Ph.D., University of ChicagoOn the Origin of Species is Darwin laying out his theory of natural selection in precise, laborious detail. He knew quite well many of the objections and arguments this supposition would invoke, and he counters every anticipated antagonism with a barrage of evidence gained from detailed observation and/or astute experimentation. The idea that plant and animal species evolved from common ancestry was an affront to 1859 sensibilities and the courage required to challenge widespread, ingrained superstition and misinformation must have been enormous. And yet, here it is. The imperfect but substantial cornerstone of biology, biochemistry, psychology, genetics, anthropology, neurology, primatology, embryology... the list is immense.

53,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17891225-karnika-kapoor,5,"Not to my surprise, many questions that are thrown at Richard Dawkins by the creationist on debate panels have been answered as it is in this book. If only people read this by themselves!It was fascinating how the ""missing links"" was explained by Darwin in a context of geology. Most importantly he was indicating towards Tectonics (that was brought into light many years after darwin's time by Alfred Wegener). Clearly, Darwin was way ahead of his contemporaries. I knew it took him years to publish his work (arguably, partially because of psychosomatic dissonance), but the intense work on gathering information and years of research bolsters his point. He indeed wanted to be very sure of the theory. I am amazed by darwin's thought process that seems very instinctive to anyone who grew up studying about evolution ... however, being the forerunner in joining the dots on the same is very nonintuitive which marks his brilliance. Highly recommended to the Creationists. "
54,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21797839-rafael,4,"im just rating this 4 stars because of its complexity, but not for the contents of the book, witch can rightfully be called a piece of art, this has to be the most complex read i had in years, it's a beutifully explained book on evoulution of especies by natural and human selection, it is incredibly detail and meticulously explained, for maximum enjoyment you must know selections and natural order to fully understand this book as well as geography and different science studies, the variety of especies mentioned in this book is very wide and unless you have a picture of each especies or variety you would be fairly lost, this not a book to take easily as i wrongly did at first but it's an stupendous read if you love science, it is very heavy and will challenge you to finish it and is up to you if you do it, for me it is a really complex read but a fulfilling one in the name of science."
55,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"It took me awhile to drag myself into reading this one. People have always commented that it was so dull and that it was convoluted and hard to follow and I have always believed in evolution and found modern books very accessible on the subject so I thought why bother? Then again I have a thing for classics, and as my list of books on evolution grew I started to chide myself that I still had not even read from Darwin's own hand. So I bent to the grain and pulled it out. This book was nothing like what I expected. Absolutely NOTHING like what I expected. If you read this with an open mind, slowly and take each of his points into consideration you find an absolute flawless logic to his argument. It is well presented and actually I find that compared to many scientific articles it is clearly written for the wider audience. Darwin wants you to get it. He wrote as plainly and carefully as he could. He did not propose his idea half assed or hurriedly. I was floored to find that all of my favorite arguments for evolution came straight from the horses mouth as it were. Darwin got it. He really really got it. He went at it from every angle he could, geological time scales, fossils, birds, plants, animals, interactions, sexual selection, selection on islands, selection in various terrains. He broke it down bit by bit and said: Look guys, I hardly wanted to buy this myself but this is how it is. Just look! See for yourself. Make up your own mind. His methodical manner is hard to shy away from. He did not come up with an idea and let others run with it. He did the research, he talked to people, he took it from all angles and presented it in the clearest manner possible. Yes I have to admit that the writing was a bit dry, but the river of content was overflowing, and the proposal was elegant and clear. What a wonderful contribution. I am honored to have read this work and chide myself yet again for my hesitation. "
56,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22315959-morgan,1,"I can now truly say that, having read the Origin of Species, I find the theory of evolution to be complete and utter hogwash. Darwin never truly gives an explanation for how microevolution can realistically extrapolated into macroevolution. Also, when he brings up objections against his theory, he gives an elaborate excuse for why he cannot prove his point rather than proving it. I am still a firm believer in Creation. It is a lot more logical than evolution."

58,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6051061-t-d-whittle,5,"I know the world has not been waiting with bated breath for 160 years to hear my opinion of this marvelous book, but I wanted to add my praise anyway. This is such a beautiful read. Darwin makes his argument for descent through modification of all organic life with such patience, eloquence, and clarity that it's awe inspiring, especially when one bears in mind that DNA and its sure-fire evidence of descent had not been discovered yet. It's truly remarkable that Darwin was right about almost every detail, using only the tools he had to work with in the nineteenth century, his formidable intelligence, and his sparkling intuition. I understand completely now why he is considered one of the few dozen greatest minds of all time, since recorded history.Darwin writes like a dream. He is gracious to and appreciative of his fellow naturalists. He's honest about the limits of what could be known with certainty, and what could be only guessed at. This style of writing in science is a breath of fresh air from a bygone era. I found Darwin's exuberance regarding his subject contagious, and am including a some of my favourite passages below, so that I can remember them.One thing that made the reading a bit tricky is that I do not speak Latin and, even if I did, would not necessarily know the names of plants and animals by their scientific labels; thus, I did not even recognise the names of common animals in my own country: the kangaroo and the platypus! Given that this book was written for Darwin's contemporaries who were laypersons, I wonder how they would have known these names, or if they read Darwin whilst having editions of botanical and zoological binomial nomenclature nearby? I had Google, of course, but found it also helpful to keep charts of geological eras at hand, an excellent globe, and maps of the world reflecting things as they were at the time of Darwin's writing. ""It is a truly wonderful fact—the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity—that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group, in the manner which we everywhere behold—namely, varieties of the same species most closely related together, species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together, forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct genera much less closely related, and genera related in different degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and classes. "" (pps. 170-171)""All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together or separating objects more or less alike.But I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe the arrangement of the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to the other groups, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but that the amount of difference in the several branches or groups, though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which they have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera, families, sections, or orders."" (p. 404)""As all organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived on this earth have to be classed together, and as all have been connected by the finest gradations, the best, or indeed, if our collections were nearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical. Descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the natural system."" (p. 427)""On the view of each organic being and each separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable it is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we wilfully will not understand."" (p. 452)""But the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate steps. The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been formed, and great valleys excavated, by the slow action of the coast-waves., The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations, accumulated during and almost infinite number of generations."" (p.453)On the imperfection of the geological record: ""The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record. The crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made at hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on and unusual concurrence of circumstances, and the blank intervals between the sucdessive stages as having been of vast duration. But we shall be able to gauget with some security the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeeding organic forms. ... "" (p. 457)This passage is so eloquent, and yet I do not believe mankind, at least, has continued to evolve towards perfection. So sadly optimistic: ""Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction fo the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual. When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the past, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity. And of the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species of each genus, and all the species of many genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. We can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to fortell that it will be the common and widely-spread species, belonging to the larger and dominant groups, which will ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Silurian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection."" (p. 459)""Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."" (p. 460)"

To the would-be classics reader who is a bit daunted at the notion of tackling a fourteen chapter science book written in 19th Century technical terms I offer the suggestion that the back half of Origin is purely optional and can be let go. The first six chapters are the most enjoyable. Four is the big one, where Darwin presents the big pitch, with One through Three being the wind-up to prep the audience. Six is fairly unusual in science literature, being an effort to admit problems with the theory and making efforts to address them. Chapter Seven, on instinct, is aumsing but not vital to the core of the work if your attention is already starting to wander. The rest that follow involve technical arguments that may be pointless to most modern readers. To follow why Darwin makes them one would have to conversant in the state of the art in zoology, botany and geology as it was 150 years ago. I skipped much of it.A few points readers with only a casual knowledge of science may take from this book- Evolution predates Darwin, whose contribution is actually the mechanism of natural selection which explains how it works. He also contributed another mechanism, sexual selection, for traits inherited for their value in obtaining mates. Darwin offers an unexpected chuckle in a quote from Aristotle which suggestive of an understanding of something very much like natural selection.>What follows is old commentary.I am reading this one for the historical value, not the science. A big joke is that people of a certain outlook do try to read it for the science so they can refute it. Silly. Origin is as about as state of the art on evolution science as Newton is on 21st Century string theory. Ah, well.What I have found interesting so far is the struggle Darwin goes through to make his argument in the absence of the kind of modern scientific language or terminology that would have made things simple and clear to his readers. Even more interesting is that Darwin had no clue as to the mechanics of inheritance and admitted as much (the discovery of DNA was a long way off in the future), and yet was able to work out so much on his own without that knowledge.Cool factoid: Darwin took his time pondering his theories for many years before suddenly rushing to get them into print. It seems that while he was taking his time another naturalist named Wallace worked out natural selection too...and then wrote to Darwin for help in placing his findings in front of the right experts! You know how the science establishment is about giving credit to the first one to publish and forgetting the also-rans who came to the same conclusions just a tad too late. One party gets into the textbooks of future generations, while the other is lucky to become a footnote.I'll post some stars when I'm done reading."

62,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,3,"Charles Darwin changed the world when he wrote this book.I mean if you think about it logically, no other book has had such a powerful impact on the way humanity views the earth; yes, we have countless religious doctrine, but never before had there been a book that so drastically alternated our perceptions of the mechanisms that are behind our existence. I’m not talking about on a spiritual level, a level of ideas that cannot be scientifically proven or unproven, but on an actual physical level. These ideas weren’t accepted overnight, few things are, but over time they began to be more and more accepted. Even today we still refer to Darwin’s ideas as “the theory of Evolution” despite the fact that it is now empirically proven as to how we got where we are. It is, generally speaking, a culturally accepted idea. The fact that we still refer to something most accept to be fact as a theory is a phenomenon. It’s unusual. Contrary to popular belief, Darwin did not seek to debunk any religious beliefs. In fact, the research he carried out put him in constant confusion about his own Christianity. For a time he believed religion and science could work together; he believed that science helped to explain some of the ideas in creation stories, but eventually he stopped believing. He lost his faith and embraced the logical mind of the scientist; again, he didn’t seek to counter religion. It was just a simple case that over time he could no longer personally and logically believe in it: it could not be proved rationally. As a student of literature, as a lover of stories, history, nature and narrative, I find myself drawn to ideas of religion and science. For anybody to call religion groundless (I say this from my own agnostically driven perspective) is to divulge a massive lack of judgment. Without wanting to offend any atheists, or anybody of faith, we will never know either way which is ultimately right. But, I do most ardently think that we can only begin to understand what it is to be human by reading and exploring the ideas of both religion and science. They have both been perpetuated by man, so I think we owe it to ourselves to try and understand why. Some of you may have noticed how eclectic my reading tastes have become. I pretty much read anything. I have many reading lists-both shortlists and longlists- but four works I simply need to read in my lifetime are The Qur'an (I have a beautiful edition I picked up from a used book store- a late 19th Century edition), The King James Bible (I’ve recently finished genesis), Relativity: The Special and the General Theory by Einstein and A Brief History of Time by Hawkins. The point is, I think in today’s world we need to understand both religion and science. Both parts form a larger part of our society. Well, anyway, that was a rather large digression. I read the origin of species back in 2013 for the first time. My second reading was more of a gloss over of certain key ideas, and a revisit of passages that I flagged down before. The ideas in the book are obviously ground-breaking, though not the first historical example of them. But, for me, this book is more of a slog than leisure driven reading. The writing isn’t great and it is terribly repetitive at times, but I suppose that’s what comes with observing the natural world in such scientific detail. From the findings here Darwin would eventually go on to lay down his full arguments in  The Decent of Man,  a read that sounds more compelling and all encompassing. So it’s another one to add to my list!"
63,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dear Carol,Thank you for your mail, and of course I remember meeting you on the flight last month! It was a very interesting discussion and I'm still thinking about it. The semester has now started here at Creationist U and I am working hard, but I found time to read the book you recommended. And I'm glad I did, because it was really a lot better than I thought it would be.I guess I was expecting Darwin to be like Richard Dawkins, but he was respectful of religious ideas. And it was great that he liked Paley's Natural Theology so much... he says he almost knew it by heart! We read Paley last year in History of Creation Science, and I also thought it was a terrific book. So I could see Darwin was an open-minded person who was prepared to look at both sides of the question. Richard Dawkins could learn a lot from that!The way he sets up his argument is smart. He starts off talking about how stockbreeders can improve their breed - well, I'm a country boy, and I could see he knew his stuff. This is someone who's spent time down at the farm and understands how country people feel about livestock. And I liked that he'd done all that work raising pigeons. Not the kind of scientist who just hangs out at the lab all day. After that, he introduces his Big Idea about the survival of the fittest and he almost made evolution sound sensible. He's a good writer. And then he was honest when he explained all the problems with the theory. He really got me - I was wondering if he was going to mention any of that stuff, and a page later he came out and said just what I was thinking! Nice work, Mr. Darwin. But I did wonder what he was doing, cutting out the ground from under his own feet. He said he could explain things like the eye and how bees could evolve to make honeycombs, but even if he was real good at making his case, I wasn't buying any.So by the halfway mark, I figured he was done, but like ol' Dubya used to say, I misunderestimated him - he'd saved all his best stuff for last. He had some good shots! I got to admit, he made me think. Why does God put the species that look alike in the same place? Like he says, it is weird how you have a mountain range, and there's one kind of animals and plants on one side, and a different kind on the other side. God's ways are inscrutable to us, but why does He care about those mountains? And the islands, they were even worse. He says if you look at the species on a lot of islands, you don't have any mammals there, except you do have bats. Why? I could see where he was going with this one - the bats could blow in off the mainland and evolve, but other mammals couldn't do that. I admit it, I don't have an answer, except maybe God's testing our faith again. But I can see not everyone will like that. I'm still wondering about those bats! Okay Mr. Darwin, I said it already but I'll say it again, you were a smart guy. So how's life at MIT? And I hope you read the book I recommended to you. A Canticle for Leibowitz will show you that faith and science have more in common than you might think!Take care,Bob"

This:""This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful not injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic.""We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change, and some species might become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would most seriously affect many of the others. If the country were open on its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. Let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up, if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area been open immigration, these same places would have been seized on by intruders. In such case, ever slight modification, which in the course of ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of improvement. ""We have reason to believe, as stated in the first chapter, that a change in the conditions of life, by specially acting on the reproductive systems, cause or increases variability; and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a changes, and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by giving a better chance of profitable variations occurring; and unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing.""

I'm surprised at how adapted we have become (or at least the segment of those people on the planet who don't reject Darwin's theory of natural selection as counter to their own idea of the way God makes and shakes) to Darwin's revolutionary idea(s). Like with many of the pantheon of scientific geniuses (Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, etc) there was a bit of random chance involved. The ground was ready for Darwin's adapted seed. There were enough scholars and scientists and rationalists around to carry his idea(s) hither and his theory thither. So while this book, and Darwin himself, were both stellar examples of scientific restraint, the force and momentum of OftS can't be under appreciated. It was just the right time and right place for a scientific revolution. Darwin and his little book walked by a labour of scientific mouldywarps who happened to find themselves on the chalk cliffs of science, pushed those sterile hybrids off, and never looked back. Evolve bitches!"

It's almost complete transcended its role as a seminal scientific tome and become a legitimate historic artefact. You can't review a historic artefact.This is a fantastic read, even viewed in a completely different way to how it would have been read at the time. It really is amazing how much evolutionary biology Darwin was able to formulate almost a century before Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA. It boggles the mind what Darwin could have been capable of if he'd had access to the last 150 years of genetic research."

If I were lost in an uncivilized world and had only two books, I would want a Webster's dictionary and this Origin of Species. The dictionary to learn word definitions and this book to learn about the flora and fauna around me. For all those people who get upset because you think this book may contradict another one you are so fond of, just be very careful not to fall off the edge of the flat 6,ooo year old earth......mgc "
68,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"Too much to unpack here and not an easy read as it was written 150 years ago. Despite all of the knocks against reading Origin for enjoyment, I can only express extreme awe and state the obvious - how much of a genius Darwin was. From his theory of natural selection to glacier theory, to hybrid plants, to fossil theory and a dozen other biological and geological theories that he developed or contributed to, it is remarkable to me how very little Darwin got wrong in a book that was 600 pages long. We live in a science based world, or at least we like to think so, and this man manages to remain so relevant. It is the scientific method at its best, one part rigorous logic, one part observation, and one part intuition. The recipe works."
69,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,4,"Decry or applaud it, there's no question this work has had a profound effect not just on science, but the culture at large. What I wouldn't read this book for is the science, or in an effort to either defend or refute the argument for evolution. The core of Darwin's argument certainly is still what was taught in my Catholic high school biology class (taught by a nun). In a nutshell, the theory is that given there are wide-ranging subtle Variations among organisms, the Malthusian Struggle for Existence causes by means of Natural Selection of the inheritable traits that are the best Adaptations to the environment the Origin of Species or as Darwin calls it, the ""theory of descent with modification.""But, after all, this book is now over 150 years old. Science is about explaining natural phenomenon and correcting mistakes through observation, experimentation and falsification--not dogma--and so is always a moving target. I know that. But I still raised an eyebrow when in the first chapter of the book Darwin said he believed the ""most frequent cause of variability"" was caused by the experiences of the parents before conception--such as cows' udders being larger in countries where they're milked because the habit of milking by itself alters in the reproductive organs what is inherited by the next generation. WTF Darwin? When Darwin first propounded his theory of evolution (a word never used in the book by the way) through natural selection, Mendel had yet to discover the basic principles of genetics in his experiments with peas and Watson and Crick had yet to unravel the structure of DNA. Nor was continental drift known and understood, so there were notable gaps in Darwin's reasoning that has since been filled. Stephen Jay Gould, one of the staunchest defenders and popularizers of evolution is famous within science particularly for where he differs from Darwin. Darwin thought changes in species were very gradual. Gould favors ""punctuated equilibrium"" where there are rapid changes followed by long periods of stability. That's why scientists today talk of the ""theory of evolution,"" not of ""Darwinism"" as if a scientific principle is an unchanging creed and Origin of Species scripture.So, the book is dated and filled with lots of details I'm sure are just plain wrong and might be onerous to unlearn. That does make me reluctant to give this book top marks despite its profound impact. Someone interested in modern evolutionary science would be better off picking up a copy of a book by Jared Diamond, Richard Dawkins, Carl Sagan (although by now I suppose his very readable Dragons of Eden is dated) or Stephen Jay Gould. So, was there no value in reading On the Origin of Species? I wouldn't say that. It's surprisingly readable--or at least understandable. There are definitely dry passages that were a slog to get through, my eyes glazing over as Darwin gave example after exhaustive example to make his points. However, I couldn't help but be impressed by the knowledge of nature shown by his wide-ranging examples from every continent from ants and bees and algae to pigeons to zebras. Given the way he cited various authorities and spoke about his own experiments, I definitely felt that here was a master generalist and enthusiast on nature. Moreover Darwin does have a gift for metaphor and illustrative examples. I was particularly taken by his explanation of ""inter-crossing"" and the function of sex in creating biological diversity. I also was struck by how cautious and civil in tone Darwin is in his arguments, devoting an entire chapter on what he saw could be the flaws and holes in his theory--particularly the issues of transitions between species and intermediate forms. Bottom line? Arguably this specific book had as much influence on the literature and politics of the next century as Freud or Marx, so I think there is historical value in reading this, preferably in the first edition (which is what I read) that exploded upon the world in 1859."

""If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from feeling the benefit of this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third stage.""
On the Origin of Species is one of the most important books ever written. Although a lot of people-scientists, naturalists and the like-were coming to the same kind of conclusions, Darwin was one of the first who wrote it all down in a profound and concise manner and used his influence and friends to make it a well-known theory: the theory of evolution.There is only one thing you need to know before you read this, and that is that Charles Darwin was a very religious man. This is a five-star worthy book, but my ignorance of this fact caused me to be so infuriated by the end that I couldn't bring myself to rate it higher. It is written exquisitely: if you've read anything particularly science-related in this day and age you will notice how science-related it is. The words, the terms, they're all very much science-related and it can be so difficult to really understand and comprehend what you're reading because it's almost in another language.This is written very much in the way any Victorian novel would have been written. There is a smattering of Latin terms, but for the most part it is easy to understand if you get in the right frame of mind as you would a Classic. It can be heavy going, however, as the paragraphs are long and often repetitive, but his thoughts on pigeons are the most endearing things I've come across: this is Victorian science and it's all about pigeons.To go back to why I only rated it three stars: throughout at no point did Darwin mention God or the creation of the world, except perhaps in very subtle reference and the theory of evolution and instinct reigns supreme, until the very end when he concludes that God did not create the world 1859 years, but millions of years ago, instead, and that all current flora and fauna are descended from the original God-created animals. I should have expected something like this but I did not and that annoyed me more than it should have. Of course, it makes the entire thing that much more impressive, though the horrific experience Darwin must have gone through as he tried to make a religious-belief co-live with a scientific frame of mind would have been supremely agonising. It's wholly my fault for this ignorance, but I still can't bring myself to heighten it.It's still one of the most important books ever written and its legacy will never become diminished, but it is often repetitive and sometimes out-dated with quite a lengthy part about geology which is fairly unremarkable, but his amusing and enjoyable experiments with flowers and his views on pigeons are just a delight.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy"
71,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"My book group selected this book for discussion probably because of the historic impact it has had on the field of science. However, I found it to be very worthy of respect from a literary viewpoint. Charles Darwin's writing comes across as a methodical thinker and patient explainer to many recalcitrant readers who are determined not to believe a word he says. He had me convinced after only a couple dozen pages, but he kept doing what seemed to me to be piling on observation after observation, explanation after explanation, until after a while I felt like crying out, ""Enough already, I believe!"" Frankly, I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge about the natural world already accumulated by the middle of the 19th century as demonstrated by this book. There are obvious things poor old Darwin didn't know about, one of them being the laws of genealogy discovered by Gregor Johann Mendel. Mendel was a contemporary of Darwin, and I have heard that a published copy of Mendel's study was on Darwin's book shelves but it hadn't been opened or read. Of course Darwin wasn't the only person who ignored Mendel. Mendel's work wasn't appreciated for its contribution to understanding of inherited traits until after his death. Meanwhile Darwin is writing this book giving many observations regarding the variability of crossings of various plants and animals, but doesn't understand why.Also, Darwin was plagued with physicists of the time who calculated that earth couldn't be as old as needed for Darwin's theory of natural selection to accomplish all the required changes. The physicists were basing their calculations of the rate cooling of the core of the earth. Of course they were wrong; what they didn't know about was radioactive decay which gives off heat they weren't making allowances for. It turns out the earth is even older than Darwin would have guessed.And of course the really big advance of science that Darwin didn't know about was the DNA double helix. Darwin insists that life forms need to be classed according to genealogy, and he speculates that in the future scientists will be able to classify life forms more accurately as more knowledge is obtained about them. Darwin would be amazed to know how precisely genealogy can be determined these days. For example, it can be determined that humans are more closely related to fungi than to photosynthetic plants.I listened to the audio version of this book. This is an example of a book that is much easier to listen to than to read because of all the big Latin words used in describing species. Having the words read aloud made them fit into the context of the sentence much better than if I were trying to read (and probably skip over) those unfamiliar words. There were six editions of ""Origin of Species"" in Darwin's life time. It could be argued that the 1859 edition is the second best version of this book with the 1860 British edition being slightly better in that it contains some insignificant, but non-substantive, corrections. The editions of 1861, 1866, 1869, and 1872 are all inferior. In them Darwin made changes and expansions in an effort to meet the objections that arose during those times. The modifications expanded the book and clouded the argument. Since most of the objections that were raised would be regarded as silly today, Darwin's arguments against them are of interest for social history, but not for Darwin's theory. I think that most published copies today are based on the 1872 edition. If you have an earlier edition you will find that it is shorter and, as indicated above, is probably better.The following quotation is from the sixth edition and not in the earlier editions. It is from a section of the book on instincts and follows a couple paragraphs discussing the habit of some birds to lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species. Mr. Darwin has just sighted some of the observations of the nesting habits of a type of cowbird [Molothrus Bonariensis] written by a naturalist colleague. ""Mr. Hudson is a strong disbeliever in evolution, but he appears to have been much struck by the imperfect instincts of the Molothrus Bonariensis that he quotes my words and asks, 'must we consider these habits not as an especially endowed or created instincts but as small consequences of one general law, namely transitions?' ""I take from the above that Darwin was enjoying the irony of a naturalist from the creationist camp finding it difficult to attribute to God the endowment of the slothful nest making habits to the cowbird. Since the behavior is repugnant it must have been caused by that old nasty evolution stuff (i.e. the work of the devil)."

Or, perhaps you are a student participating in one of nation's modern and progressive science classes, learning about the Origins of Man, but confused by the lack of scientifically observable studies missing from your text books.

It is his scientific treaty based on the idea of all organism living on the earth to be descendants from one or several original progenitors.The work is mostly a transcription of the author’s notes throughout his years of study and his famous voyage on the HMS Beagle to the Southern Hemisphere. It had likely been addressed to the quite sceptic scientific community of his time, to demonstrate his idea and to bring supporting material enough to convince and to proof its validity. Apart from the excessively rich scientific vocabulary, the book is pleasant reading. A few quotations will give some insight: ""This Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements, and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence into my accuracy. No doubt errors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone. In considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryonic relations, their geographical distribution, geological successions, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties from other species.”The work is developed in chapters:Variations under Domestications,Variations in Nature,Struggle for existence,Natural selection; or Survival of the fittest,Laws of variation,Difficulties of the theory, Miscellaneous objections to the theory of Natural Selection,Instinct,Hybridism,On the imperfection of the Geological Record,On the Geological Succession of Organic Beings Geographical distribution,Mutual affinities of organic beings, Embryology,Quotations from Recapitulation and Conclusion: ""I see no good reason why the view given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of anyone. It could be just as noble a conception for a Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws. The belief that species were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was believed to be of short duration; and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are apt to assume, that the geological record would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species. Now, things are wholly changed, and almost every naturalist admits the great principle of evolution, over the old belief in the creation of species from the dust of the earth. The laws of Nature, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to the struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural selection, and the Extinction of less-improved forms. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one.”I have much enjoyed reading this book and am glad not to have missed it. I recommend it to anyone interested in Natural History or just in knowledge as such."

At times, it was hard getting through this book, mainly because it's dense and sometimes Darwin tended to drag and not get to the point, but I'm glad I finally read it. However, I think I should have read this at another point of my life - I mean, it was exasperating to read something I had just studied at a biology course I was taking. I still don't regret reading this. If you're considering on whether picking this book or not (yeah, I'm actually recommending it), I suggest you do it between your leisure reading because it can get tedious if you swallow it all at once."

76,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/210123-d-g,5,"My science education left a lot to be desired. I was never taught the Theory of Natural Selection in school but only heard it mentioned when some adults scoffed at it. Thankfully, my natural talents steered me away from a career in Biology or Genetics, so this lack of knowledge didn’t affect my career prospects. It just affected my understanding of the world. I learned years later the basics of the theory but this just piqued my interest about reading the actual book. I always have problems with Victorian authors (very long sentences) so the print version gave me some difficulty. If it weren’t for Richard Dawkins' excellent narration, I don’t know that I could have enjoyed this book as much.I’m almost shocked that I was able to follow the concepts herein as well as I did. I am amazed that Mr. Darwin could write this book (one of the most important in the history of science and the whole world) in such clear, concise way, that a person with minimal understanding of the topic in general could follow along so well. The concepts are explained logically with tons of examples so the reader is not left dangling wondering what he meant. Not only that, but he also writes beautifully and the prose is sometimes as poetic as it is instructive:As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.From the beginning, I understood this wasn’t a book I could listen in one sitting or while doing other things. I took it slowly and that allowed me to think things through. It made me think a lot about our place in the world and how sometimes we think we are above the system when in fact, we are just one creature among millions and not the most important in the grand scheme of nature (if we were to go extinct, the planet will continue merrily along.) It made reflect in our attempts to control nature, to see change as a bad thing, and our hubris that we can keep in check a process that has moved relentlessly forward for millions of years.Darwin was certainly cognizant that his theory wouldn’t be accepted immediately: “Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory.”  But I think he would be surprised by how much discussion there is still going on about the subject, specially given that DNA evidence has already proven he was correct in thinking that every living being sprouted from a single progenitor (mind staggering as it seems.)As I already mentioned, Richard Dawkins is the narrator for this audiobook and he did an amazing job - you could tell he's probably read this book a million times and knows it like the back of his hand. His diction was very precise and clear; and his enthusiasm for the subject was contagious. It almost feels like Darwin is the one speaking. Overall, a must read for anybody with an interest in learning how we came into being. "

Not because it’s poorly written, archaically worded, or just a boring topic- all untrue- but because the ideas were so influential that the entire book is just one big “duh, yeah, I’m already on board with this, you don’t need to harp on so much, I see what you’re getting at and I agree it makes sense.” (I remember a similar feeling with Singer’s Animal Liberation, for example.)  This is obviously one of those books. If you’ve got a high school diploma, you already understand natural selection, and if you’re interested in biology at all, you probably also understand the evidentiary support/finer tunings of the theory.  Essentially this is like, 700 pages of Darwin giving evidence for his theory by listing out different animals or plants and discussing how the variations imply a common ancestor/his theory and how they disprove his opponents’ arguments. Pigeons with X number of tail feathers, horses with leg stripes, radishes versus rutabagas. Lots and lots and lots of details about things like this.  I’m glad I read it because Darwin is clearly anxious nobody will believe his wild new theory, since he throws so much evidence at the reader. This serves, to me, as a fantastic reminder that this was, in fact, a radical kooky theory at the time and nothing in science should be taken for granted as truth because there is always, always always, a shakeup on the horizon that will make us question everything. And no era is immune to that- every era has thought itself “finally at the truth” and every time we’ve been wrong. As we are now, in ways we can’t even imagine yet."
78,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29868756-katie-bananas,5,"Celebratory 2:00 am review, just great!!! When I finished this, I was definitely clapping my hands!! This is not a story if you are one of those who are mad excited to read it. It's a tome of its size that is equivalent to an encyclopedia with depth, width, and value. It's the densest nonfiction I have read. It is an attempt to read a genre I really wasn't familiar with. Since I got into reading, I believe that nonfiction is one of the genres that is most daunting to me. In 2016, I definitely attempted a few; yet, I never really expected to grab this one off the shelves like that and just read it. It has an encyclopedia feel and it definitely reads like one as well. Charles Darwin is quite the familiar science genius known to students studying biology everywhere. He along with Mendel, the father of genetics, are the monsters for biology making it seemingly hard. As I mentioned above it's not a story, and it's not a simple read or a book for enjoyment. It is also not a list of drone. It's a rather valuable read of its size with historical touches and very good research on animals and all their genres with density and heaviness. The theory of natural selection as studied in class is not well explained by mere professors. I bet these clowns never came to attempt reading this. I'm repeating it's not a novel and a story you read for leisure time. Professors want to finish curricula, and that's why that's the part that's rushed at the end. I dreaded the study of kingdoms and phyla and Darwinism, because it was never properly explained.After reading this, I think my self respect and self esteem both grew at sheer, personal will while experiencing this book. Before reading, my imagination was always centered around the fact that this book is boring and I'll never find it on ebook. Now, I come to say that I was really thankful to my library for providing it online. Natural selection as emphasized, is the pure fact that all animals are picked out in accordance of their strengths and most intricate and distinguishable characteristics to build the up and coming generations. With this critical focus and specific selection comes variability. Variability is the guy who screams so loud, that for instance, a rose and an orchid are not the same, even though they are both very well known beautiful flowers to the sight of our eyes. Different species of dogs and bees evolve to not be the same. Each animal evolves to have their varied kinds and characteristics. I think of it as myself reading a book and loving it at the end. Did I necessarily love each page? Not necessarily, which presents myself as selective; however, I may have liked the book for its content or flow of a story, even though I didn't like a character or two, or even three. This book is my dense pride of 2016. It will mark my last nonfiction of the year, not because I had enough and finished a book; but rather, because of its mere volume, density, and pure heaviness. I intentionally took long breaks to go back and think what I learned, it really was a ton of material!!! This doesn't make it a textbook. It's an awesome encyclopedia full of potential with long lists of animals who were very well researched down to the hairs on their skin to state their merest and very specified difference, as to say: ""We are both redheads, but you specifically have this characteristic pimple or bump, which makes you slightly different"". Natural selection is a dense concept to attain and learn, because of how variability in the varieties are sincerely observed. I had mentioned that I skipped a whole chapter, which I ended up reading at the very end. It was the chapter on the objections against the theory. I was wondering why is this in the middle of the book, rather than at the end? I skipped it at first to first learn about the theory and various research along with all the researchers who helped Darwin writing this book with insights on their research. Objections, I thought came later. The reason why they came in the middle, I later on discovered is for the fact that these particular objections were not covering the whole book, but rather the first few chapters.It was very good, very dense, and a very important scientific classic. It needs a good amount of patience and belief in your progress. I have a different appreciation for animals and plants knowing that the best of its kind supplant all the others, making it really significant and absolutely striking. Seriously? Yes, absolute genius of a volume!! :)"
79,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1496261-cora-judd,5,"Richard Dawkins' narration of this book is excellent -- I enjoyed it immensely, however, without my semester of physical anthropology, the essential points would have required much more mental attention. Dawkins inserts clarifying information throughout the book and while Darwin's writing is wonderfully clear, I think more of Dawkins' notes and updates would have been an enhancement.I was surprised to see how diverse Darwin's background research was and how elegantly he wrote. He anticipated counter-arguments to his ideas and cleanly, systematically eliminated them. As he concluded each level of his argument, the gaps in his knowledge (due to gaps in scientific progress at the time of his being published) required that he make certain logical leaps and assumptions. These were especially interesting because he was invariably correct, as time has shown.Dawkins abridged the book to some degree which makes me leary - I want to know what the author intended the reader to know. And because the subject is still (astoundingly) controversial, abridging anything of this nature will likely invite criticism."
80,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2345961-pollopicu,2,"What in the world made me want to read this Goliath of a science book? My goodness! I guess if I had to search deep within myself I would have to say I wanted to read anything Darwin, just to see what all the fuss was about, but mostly because of the reviews I read on Goodreads. I thought The Origin of Species would turn me into the science-loving person I always thought lurked inside me.The main reason I finished it is because any science book that has had this much publicity deserves to be read and finished.First of all, it contained a considerable amount of text for a study which was only suppose to be a treatise. This book wasn't difficult to read, as many would have you think. It's not. In fact, it's pretty straight forward. But are you interested in reading 700 pages of things having to do with birds, aquatic mammals, cattle, beaks, gills, bills, plumage, fauna, fowl, pollen, eggs, and embryos? Don't get me wrong, I'm as interested to hear where we might have originated from as much as the next person, but if you take the book at face value, who would be interested in reading page after page of detailed observations of animals most of us will live a lifetime without even having encountered and if we do, so what. I say that as a lover of nature. I mean a LOVER of all things outdoors that have to do with looking at stuff, not reading about it. Where I live we often see herons, and gorgeous owls, foxes, snakes, etc, but I don't want to read 700 pages about them. I want to admire them for a while, but then keep it moving.From what I gathered, it seems to me that scientists and naturalists can't even agree on the differences between species and varieties to begin with. A lot of these studies aren't even conclusive, which makes a lot of sense now since it's a book on the THEORY of evolution. I didn't stop to think of the literal definition of the word ""theory"". Had I paused for a moment to give it thought, I would've realized I would be committing weeks to a treatise that is basically speculation. To me that's a huge waste of time when there are so many other books out there to read. Give me history or give me straight up fiction by topics on theory seem pointless to me. Also, the idea that Darwin's theory of evolution was indirectly responsible for the genocide of so many people during the Nazi era is simply horrific. I had no clue when I began reading this book that Hitler was a follower of Darwin's theory, taking it to heart (a bit too much) the supposed superiority of the white race, hence, making all other races inferior, and therefore extinguishing them. The Subtitle of The Species of Origin was suppose to be “The Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life.” Darwin referred to inferior races as ""savages"", and by savages he meant people with darker skin, such as Native Americans and Africans. Darwin, being the prolific and respected scientist he was, influenced many people (through his work) to practice prejudice, racism and oppression. Hitler believed that the human gene pool could be improved by selective breeding, very much like that of cattle in farm breeding, thus protecting the ""superior"" race. This is simply horrifying.In the end I'm glad I read this book, although I hated the actual reading part. Not so much because of what it contains, but because of the role it has played in our history, of which I was clueless about. In the frustration of reading this book, I made the effort to dig for more information about why so many modern day people are still fascinated by it, still not sure, but I did learn a lot from it, and it did inspire me to dig deep into other genocides that have been committed around the world in which this book may or may not have been indirectly responsible for. However, the book was absolutely tedious. It's like reading about a subject you absolutely loath, like sports, or construction. The part of the book that actually cracked me up was chapter XII (Geographical Distribution) because after having read what seemed like 200 pages of that, the next chapter (XIII) was called ""Geographical Distribution continued"", lol. At that point I was delirious and might have lost it. It's very rare for me to purposely not recommend reading what people consider a ""required read"", but this was a tough one. If you want to read it to add it to your library, go ahead, but I'm giving you fair warning, it's laborious like nothing you've ever read. You will have to see for yourself. "
81,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen,3,"3.0 to 3.5 stars. Not anything like what I would call a ""fun"" read, but I am really happy that I finally read this book given the tremendous influence it has had on the history on modern scientific thinking. The book itself, while dry, is fairly accessible and is not bogged down with overly complex scientific jargon. I would read a couple of chapters a day in between my ""pleasure"" reading and it made the book much easier to absorb. Definitely worth reading. "

And we should be proud that we are the only species that has figured out how we came to be."" ~Jerry A. Coyne, Ph.D., University of ChicagoOn the Origin of Species is Darwin laying out his theory of natural selection in precise, laborious detail. He knew quite well many of the objections and arguments this supposition would invoke, and he counters every anticipated antagonism with a barrage of evidence gained from detailed observation and/or astute experimentation. The idea that plant and animal species evolved from common ancestry was an affront to 1859 sensibilities and the courage required to challenge widespread, ingrained superstition and misinformation must have been enormous. And yet, here it is. The imperfect but substantial cornerstone of biology, biochemistry, psychology, genetics, anthropology, neurology, primatology, embryology... the list is immense.

83,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17891225-karnika-kapoor,5,"Not to my surprise, many questions that are thrown at Richard Dawkins by the creationist on debate panels have been answered as it is in this book. If only people read this by themselves!It was fascinating how the ""missing links"" was explained by Darwin in a context of geology. Most importantly he was indicating towards Tectonics (that was brought into light many years after darwin's time by Alfred Wegener). Clearly, Darwin was way ahead of his contemporaries. I knew it took him years to publish his work (arguably, partially because of psychosomatic dissonance), but the intense work on gathering information and years of research bolsters his point. He indeed wanted to be very sure of the theory. I am amazed by darwin's thought process that seems very instinctive to anyone who grew up studying about evolution ... however, being the forerunner in joining the dots on the same is very nonintuitive which marks his brilliance. Highly recommended to the Creationists. "
84,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21797839-rafael,4,"im just rating this 4 stars because of its complexity, but not for the contents of the book, witch can rightfully be called a piece of art, this has to be the most complex read i had in years, it's a beutifully explained book on evoulution of especies by natural and human selection, it is incredibly detail and meticulously explained, for maximum enjoyment you must know selections and natural order to fully understand this book as well as geography and different science studies, the variety of especies mentioned in this book is very wide and unless you have a picture of each especies or variety you would be fairly lost, this not a book to take easily as i wrongly did at first but it's an stupendous read if you love science, it is very heavy and will challenge you to finish it and is up to you if you do it, for me it is a really complex read but a fulfilling one in the name of science."
85,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"It took me awhile to drag myself into reading this one. People have always commented that it was so dull and that it was convoluted and hard to follow and I have always believed in evolution and found modern books very accessible on the subject so I thought why bother? Then again I have a thing for classics, and as my list of books on evolution grew I started to chide myself that I still had not even read from Darwin's own hand. So I bent to the grain and pulled it out. This book was nothing like what I expected. Absolutely NOTHING like what I expected. If you read this with an open mind, slowly and take each of his points into consideration you find an absolute flawless logic to his argument. It is well presented and actually I find that compared to many scientific articles it is clearly written for the wider audience. Darwin wants you to get it. He wrote as plainly and carefully as he could. He did not propose his idea half assed or hurriedly. I was floored to find that all of my favorite arguments for evolution came straight from the horses mouth as it were. Darwin got it. He really really got it. He went at it from every angle he could, geological time scales, fossils, birds, plants, animals, interactions, sexual selection, selection on islands, selection in various terrains. He broke it down bit by bit and said: Look guys, I hardly wanted to buy this myself but this is how it is. Just look! See for yourself. Make up your own mind. His methodical manner is hard to shy away from. He did not come up with an idea and let others run with it. He did the research, he talked to people, he took it from all angles and presented it in the clearest manner possible. Yes I have to admit that the writing was a bit dry, but the river of content was overflowing, and the proposal was elegant and clear. What a wonderful contribution. I am honored to have read this work and chide myself yet again for my hesitation. "
86,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22315959-morgan,1,"I can now truly say that, having read the Origin of Species, I find the theory of evolution to be complete and utter hogwash. Darwin never truly gives an explanation for how microevolution can realistically extrapolated into macroevolution. Also, when he brings up objections against his theory, he gives an elaborate excuse for why he cannot prove his point rather than proving it. I am still a firm believer in Creation. It is a lot more logical than evolution."

88,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6051061-t-d-whittle,5,"I know the world has not been waiting with bated breath for 160 years to hear my opinion of this marvelous book, but I wanted to add my praise anyway. This is such a beautiful read. Darwin makes his argument for descent through modification of all organic life with such patience, eloquence, and clarity that it's awe inspiring, especially when one bears in mind that DNA and its sure-fire evidence of descent had not been discovered yet. It's truly remarkable that Darwin was right about almost every detail, using only the tools he had to work with in the nineteenth century, his formidable intelligence, and his sparkling intuition. I understand completely now why he is considered one of the few dozen greatest minds of all time, since recorded history.Darwin writes like a dream. He is gracious to and appreciative of his fellow naturalists. He's honest about the limits of what could be known with certainty, and what could be only guessed at. This style of writing in science is a breath of fresh air from a bygone era. I found Darwin's exuberance regarding his subject contagious, and am including a some of my favourite passages below, so that I can remember them.One thing that made the reading a bit tricky is that I do not speak Latin and, even if I did, would not necessarily know the names of plants and animals by their scientific labels; thus, I did not even recognise the names of common animals in my own country: the kangaroo and the platypus! Given that this book was written for Darwin's contemporaries who were laypersons, I wonder how they would have known these names, or if they read Darwin whilst having editions of botanical and zoological binomial nomenclature nearby? I had Google, of course, but found it also helpful to keep charts of geological eras at hand, an excellent globe, and maps of the world reflecting things as they were at the time of Darwin's writing. ""It is a truly wonderful fact—the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity—that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group, in the manner which we everywhere behold—namely, varieties of the same species most closely related together, species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together, forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct genera much less closely related, and genera related in different degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and classes. "" (pps. 170-171)""All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together or separating objects more or less alike.But I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe the arrangement of the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to the other groups, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but that the amount of difference in the several branches or groups, though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which they have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera, families, sections, or orders."" (p. 404)""As all organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived on this earth have to be classed together, and as all have been connected by the finest gradations, the best, or indeed, if our collections were nearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical. Descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the natural system."" (p. 427)""On the view of each organic being and each separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable it is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we wilfully will not understand."" (p. 452)""But the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate steps. The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been formed, and great valleys excavated, by the slow action of the coast-waves., The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations, accumulated during and almost infinite number of generations."" (p.453)On the imperfection of the geological record: ""The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record. The crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made at hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on and unusual concurrence of circumstances, and the blank intervals between the sucdessive stages as having been of vast duration. But we shall be able to gauget with some security the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeeding organic forms. ... "" (p. 457)This passage is so eloquent, and yet I do not believe mankind, at least, has continued to evolve towards perfection. So sadly optimistic: ""Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction fo the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual. When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the past, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity. And of the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species of each genus, and all the species of many genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. We can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to fortell that it will be the common and widely-spread species, belonging to the larger and dominant groups, which will ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Silurian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection."" (p. 459)""Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."" (p. 460)"

To the would-be classics reader who is a bit daunted at the notion of tackling a fourteen chapter science book written in 19th Century technical terms I offer the suggestion that the back half of Origin is purely optional and can be let go. The first six chapters are the most enjoyable. Four is the big one, where Darwin presents the big pitch, with One through Three being the wind-up to prep the audience. Six is fairly unusual in science literature, being an effort to admit problems with the theory and making efforts to address them. Chapter Seven, on instinct, is aumsing but not vital to the core of the work if your attention is already starting to wander. The rest that follow involve technical arguments that may be pointless to most modern readers. To follow why Darwin makes them one would have to conversant in the state of the art in zoology, botany and geology as it was 150 years ago. I skipped much of it.A few points readers with only a casual knowledge of science may take from this book- Evolution predates Darwin, whose contribution is actually the mechanism of natural selection which explains how it works. He also contributed another mechanism, sexual selection, for traits inherited for their value in obtaining mates. Darwin offers an unexpected chuckle in a quote from Aristotle which suggestive of an understanding of something very much like natural selection.>What follows is old commentary.I am reading this one for the historical value, not the science. A big joke is that people of a certain outlook do try to read it for the science so they can refute it. Silly. Origin is as about as state of the art on evolution science as Newton is on 21st Century string theory. Ah, well.What I have found interesting so far is the struggle Darwin goes through to make his argument in the absence of the kind of modern scientific language or terminology that would have made things simple and clear to his readers. Even more interesting is that Darwin had no clue as to the mechanics of inheritance and admitted as much (the discovery of DNA was a long way off in the future), and yet was able to work out so much on his own without that knowledge.Cool factoid: Darwin took his time pondering his theories for many years before suddenly rushing to get them into print. It seems that while he was taking his time another naturalist named Wallace worked out natural selection too...and then wrote to Darwin for help in placing his findings in front of the right experts! You know how the science establishment is about giving credit to the first one to publish and forgetting the also-rans who came to the same conclusions just a tad too late. One party gets into the textbooks of future generations, while the other is lucky to become a footnote.I'll post some stars when I'm done reading."

92,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,3,"Charles Darwin changed the world when he wrote this book.I mean if you think about it logically, no other book has had such a powerful impact on the way humanity views the earth; yes, we have countless religious doctrine, but never before had there been a book that so drastically alternated our perceptions of the mechanisms that are behind our existence. I’m not talking about on a spiritual level, a level of ideas that cannot be scientifically proven or unproven, but on an actual physical level. These ideas weren’t accepted overnight, few things are, but over time they began to be more and more accepted. Even today we still refer to Darwin’s ideas as “the theory of Evolution” despite the fact that it is now empirically proven as to how we got where we are. It is, generally speaking, a culturally accepted idea. The fact that we still refer to something most accept to be fact as a theory is a phenomenon. It’s unusual. Contrary to popular belief, Darwin did not seek to debunk any religious beliefs. In fact, the research he carried out put him in constant confusion about his own Christianity. For a time he believed religion and science could work together; he believed that science helped to explain some of the ideas in creation stories, but eventually he stopped believing. He lost his faith and embraced the logical mind of the scientist; again, he didn’t seek to counter religion. It was just a simple case that over time he could no longer personally and logically believe in it: it could not be proved rationally. As a student of literature, as a lover of stories, history, nature and narrative, I find myself drawn to ideas of religion and science. For anybody to call religion groundless (I say this from my own agnostically driven perspective) is to divulge a massive lack of judgment. Without wanting to offend any atheists, or anybody of faith, we will never know either way which is ultimately right. But, I do most ardently think that we can only begin to understand what it is to be human by reading and exploring the ideas of both religion and science. They have both been perpetuated by man, so I think we owe it to ourselves to try and understand why. Some of you may have noticed how eclectic my reading tastes have become. I pretty much read anything. I have many reading lists-both shortlists and longlists- but four works I simply need to read in my lifetime are The Qur'an (I have a beautiful edition I picked up from a used book store- a late 19th Century edition), The King James Bible (I’ve recently finished genesis), Relativity: The Special and the General Theory by Einstein and A Brief History of Time by Hawkins. The point is, I think in today’s world we need to understand both religion and science. Both parts form a larger part of our society. Well, anyway, that was a rather large digression. I read the origin of species back in 2013 for the first time. My second reading was more of a gloss over of certain key ideas, and a revisit of passages that I flagged down before. The ideas in the book are obviously ground-breaking, though not the first historical example of them. But, for me, this book is more of a slog than leisure driven reading. The writing isn’t great and it is terribly repetitive at times, but I suppose that’s what comes with observing the natural world in such scientific detail. From the findings here Darwin would eventually go on to lay down his full arguments in  The Decent of Man,  a read that sounds more compelling and all encompassing. So it’s another one to add to my list!"
93,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dear Carol,Thank you for your mail, and of course I remember meeting you on the flight last month! It was a very interesting discussion and I'm still thinking about it. The semester has now started here at Creationist U and I am working hard, but I found time to read the book you recommended. And I'm glad I did, because it was really a lot better than I thought it would be.I guess I was expecting Darwin to be like Richard Dawkins, but he was respectful of religious ideas. And it was great that he liked Paley's Natural Theology so much... he says he almost knew it by heart! We read Paley last year in History of Creation Science, and I also thought it was a terrific book. So I could see Darwin was an open-minded person who was prepared to look at both sides of the question. Richard Dawkins could learn a lot from that!The way he sets up his argument is smart. He starts off talking about how stockbreeders can improve their breed - well, I'm a country boy, and I could see he knew his stuff. This is someone who's spent time down at the farm and understands how country people feel about livestock. And I liked that he'd done all that work raising pigeons. Not the kind of scientist who just hangs out at the lab all day. After that, he introduces his Big Idea about the survival of the fittest and he almost made evolution sound sensible. He's a good writer. And then he was honest when he explained all the problems with the theory. He really got me - I was wondering if he was going to mention any of that stuff, and a page later he came out and said just what I was thinking! Nice work, Mr. Darwin. But I did wonder what he was doing, cutting out the ground from under his own feet. He said he could explain things like the eye and how bees could evolve to make honeycombs, but even if he was real good at making his case, I wasn't buying any.So by the halfway mark, I figured he was done, but like ol' Dubya used to say, I misunderestimated him - he'd saved all his best stuff for last. He had some good shots! I got to admit, he made me think. Why does God put the species that look alike in the same place? Like he says, it is weird how you have a mountain range, and there's one kind of animals and plants on one side, and a different kind on the other side. God's ways are inscrutable to us, but why does He care about those mountains? And the islands, they were even worse. He says if you look at the species on a lot of islands, you don't have any mammals there, except you do have bats. Why? I could see where he was going with this one - the bats could blow in off the mainland and evolve, but other mammals couldn't do that. I admit it, I don't have an answer, except maybe God's testing our faith again. But I can see not everyone will like that. I'm still wondering about those bats! Okay Mr. Darwin, I said it already but I'll say it again, you were a smart guy. So how's life at MIT? And I hope you read the book I recommended to you. A Canticle for Leibowitz will show you that faith and science have more in common than you might think!Take care,Bob"

This:""This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful not injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic.""We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change, and some species might become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would most seriously affect many of the others. If the country were open on its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. Let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up, if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area been open immigration, these same places would have been seized on by intruders. In such case, ever slight modification, which in the course of ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of improvement. ""We have reason to believe, as stated in the first chapter, that a change in the conditions of life, by specially acting on the reproductive systems, cause or increases variability; and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a changes, and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by giving a better chance of profitable variations occurring; and unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing.""

I'm surprised at how adapted we have become (or at least the segment of those people on the planet who don't reject Darwin's theory of natural selection as counter to their own idea of the way God makes and shakes) to Darwin's revolutionary idea(s). Like with many of the pantheon of scientific geniuses (Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, etc) there was a bit of random chance involved. The ground was ready for Darwin's adapted seed. There were enough scholars and scientists and rationalists around to carry his idea(s) hither and his theory thither. So while this book, and Darwin himself, were both stellar examples of scientific restraint, the force and momentum of OftS can't be under appreciated. It was just the right time and right place for a scientific revolution. Darwin and his little book walked by a labour of scientific mouldywarps who happened to find themselves on the chalk cliffs of science, pushed those sterile hybrids off, and never looked back. Evolve bitches!"

It's almost complete transcended its role as a seminal scientific tome and become a legitimate historic artefact. You can't review a historic artefact.This is a fantastic read, even viewed in a completely different way to how it would have been read at the time. It really is amazing how much evolutionary biology Darwin was able to formulate almost a century before Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA. It boggles the mind what Darwin could have been capable of if he'd had access to the last 150 years of genetic research."

If I were lost in an uncivilized world and had only two books, I would want a Webster's dictionary and this Origin of Species. The dictionary to learn word definitions and this book to learn about the flora and fauna around me.

98,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"Too much to unpack here and not an easy read as it was written 150 years ago. Despite all of the knocks against reading Origin for enjoyment, I can only express extreme awe and state the obvious - how much of a genius Darwin was. From his theory of natural selection to glacier theory, to hybrid plants, to fossil theory and a dozen other biological and geological theories that he developed or contributed to, it is remarkable to me how very little Darwin got wrong in a book that was 600 pages long. We live in a science based world, or at least we like to think so, and this man manages to remain so relevant. It is the scientific method at its best, one part rigorous logic, one part observation, and one part intuition. The recipe works."
99,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,4,"Decry or applaud it, there's no question this work has had a profound effect not just on science, but the culture at large. What I wouldn't read this book for is the science, or in an effort to either defend or refute the argument for evolution. The core of Darwin's argument certainly is still what was taught in my Catholic high school biology class (taught by a nun). In a nutshell, the theory is that given there are wide-ranging subtle Variations among organisms, the Malthusian Struggle for Existence causes by means of Natural Selection of the inheritable traits that are the best Adaptations to the environment the Origin of Species or as Darwin calls it, the ""theory of descent with modification.""But, after all, this book is now over 150 years old. Science is about explaining natural phenomenon and correcting mistakes through observation, experimentation and falsification--not dogma--and so is always a moving target. I know that. But I still raised an eyebrow when in the first chapter of the book Darwin said he believed the ""most frequent cause of variability"" was caused by the experiences of the parents before conception--such as cows' udders being larger in countries where they're milked because the habit of milking by itself alters in the reproductive organs what is inherited by the next generation. WTF Darwin? When Darwin first propounded his theory of evolution (a word never used in the book by the way) through natural selection, Mendel had yet to discover the basic principles of genetics in his experiments with peas and Watson and Crick had yet to unravel the structure of DNA. Nor was continental drift known and understood, so there were notable gaps in Darwin's reasoning that has since been filled. Stephen Jay Gould, one of the staunchest defenders and popularizers of evolution is famous within science particularly for where he differs from Darwin. Darwin thought changes in species were very gradual. Gould favors ""punctuated equilibrium"" where there are rapid changes followed by long periods of stability. That's why scientists today talk of the ""theory of evolution,"" not of ""Darwinism"" as if a scientific principle is an unchanging creed and Origin of Species scripture.So, the book is dated and filled with lots of details I'm sure are just plain wrong and might be onerous to unlearn. That does make me reluctant to give this book top marks despite its profound impact. Someone interested in modern evolutionary science would be better off picking up a copy of a book by Jared Diamond, Richard Dawkins, Carl Sagan (although by now I suppose his very readable Dragons of Eden is dated) or Stephen Jay Gould. So, was there no value in reading On the Origin of Species? I wouldn't say that. It's surprisingly readable--or at least understandable. There are definitely dry passages that were a slog to get through, my eyes glazing over as Darwin gave example after exhaustive example to make his points. However, I couldn't help but be impressed by the knowledge of nature shown by his wide-ranging examples from every continent from ants and bees and algae to pigeons to zebras. Given the way he cited various authorities and spoke about his own experiments, I definitely felt that here was a master generalist and enthusiast on nature. Moreover Darwin does have a gift for metaphor and illustrative examples. I was particularly taken by his explanation of ""inter-crossing"" and the function of sex in creating biological diversity. I also was struck by how cautious and civil in tone Darwin is in his arguments, devoting an entire chapter on what he saw could be the flaws and holes in his theory--particularly the issues of transitions between species and intermediate forms. Bottom line? Arguably this specific book had as much influence on the literature and politics of the next century as Freud or Marx, so I think there is historical value in reading this, preferably in the first edition (which is what I read) that exploded upon the world in 1859."

""If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from feeling the benefit of this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third stage.""
On the Origin of Species is one of the most important books ever written. Although a lot of people-scientists, naturalists and the like-were coming to the same kind of conclusions, Darwin was one of the first who wrote it all down in a profound and concise manner and used his influence and friends to make it a well-known theory: the theory of evolution.There is only one thing you need to know before you read this, and that is that Charles Darwin was a very religious man. This is a five-star worthy book, but my ignorance of this fact caused me to be so infuriated by the end that I couldn't bring myself to rate it higher. It is written exquisitely: if you've read anything particularly science-related in this day and age you will notice how science-related it is. The words, the terms, they're all very much science-related and it can be so difficult to really understand and comprehend what you're reading because it's almost in another language.This is written very much in the way any Victorian novel would have been written. There is a smattering of Latin terms, but for the most part it is easy to understand if you get in the right frame of mind as you would a Classic. It can be heavy going, however, as the paragraphs are long and often repetitive, but his thoughts on pigeons are the most endearing things I've come across: this is Victorian science and it's all about pigeons.To go back to why I only rated it three stars: throughout at no point did Darwin mention God or the creation of the world, except perhaps in very subtle reference and the theory of evolution and instinct reigns supreme, until the very end when he concludes that God did not create the world 1859 years, but millions of years ago, instead, and that all current flora and fauna are descended from the original God-created animals. I should have expected something like this but I did not and that annoyed me more than it should have. Of course, it makes the entire thing that much more impressive, though the horrific experience Darwin must have gone through as he tried to make a religious-belief co-live with a scientific frame of mind would have been supremely agonising. It's wholly my fault for this ignorance, but I still can't bring myself to heighten it.It's still one of the most important books ever written and its legacy will never become diminished, but it is often repetitive and sometimes out-dated with quite a lengthy part about geology which is fairly unremarkable, but his amusing and enjoyable experiments with flowers and his views on pigeons are just a delight.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy"
101,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"My book group selected this book for discussion probably because of the historic impact it has had on the field of science. However, I found it to be very worthy of respect from a literary viewpoint. Charles Darwin's writing comes across as a methodical thinker and patient explainer to many recalcitrant readers who are determined not to believe a word he says. He had me convinced after only a couple dozen pages, but he kept doing what seemed to me to be piling on observation after observation, explanation after explanation, until after a while I felt like crying out, ""Enough already, I believe!"" Frankly, I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge about the natural world already accumulated by the middle of the 19th century as demonstrated by this book. There are obvious things poor old Darwin didn't know about, one of them being the laws of genealogy discovered by Gregor Johann Mendel. Mendel was a contemporary of Darwin, and I have heard that a published copy of Mendel's study was on Darwin's book shelves but it hadn't been opened or read. Of course Darwin wasn't the only person who ignored Mendel. Mendel's work wasn't appreciated for its contribution to understanding of inherited traits until after his death. Meanwhile Darwin is writing this book giving many observations regarding the variability of crossings of various plants and animals, but doesn't understand why.Also, Darwin was plagued with physicists of the time who calculated that earth couldn't be as old as needed for Darwin's theory of natural selection to accomplish all the required changes. The physicists were basing their calculations of the rate cooling of the core of the earth. Of course they were wrong; what they didn't know about was radioactive decay which gives off heat they weren't making allowances for. It turns out the earth is even older than Darwin would have guessed.And of course the really big advance of science that Darwin didn't know about was the DNA double helix. Darwin insists that life forms need to be classed according to genealogy, and he speculates that in the future scientists will be able to classify life forms more accurately as more knowledge is obtained about them. Darwin would be amazed to know how precisely genealogy can be determined these days. For example, it can be determined that humans are more closely related to fungi than to photosynthetic plants.I listened to the audio version of this book. This is an example of a book that is much easier to listen to than to read because of all the big Latin words used in describing species. Having the words read aloud made them fit into the context of the sentence much better than if I were trying to read (and probably skip over) those unfamiliar words. There were six editions of ""Origin of Species"" in Darwin's life time. It could be argued that the 1859 edition is the second best version of this book with the 1860 British edition being slightly better in that it contains some insignificant, but non-substantive, corrections. The editions of 1861, 1866, 1869, and 1872 are all inferior. In them Darwin made changes and expansions in an effort to meet the objections that arose during those times. The modifications expanded the book and clouded the argument. Since most of the objections that were raised would be regarded as silly today, Darwin's arguments against them are of interest for social history, but not for Darwin's theory. I think that most published copies today are based on the 1872 edition. If you have an earlier edition you will find that it is shorter and, as indicated above, is probably better.The following quotation is from the sixth edition and not in the earlier editions. It is from a section of the book on instincts and follows a couple paragraphs discussing the habit of some birds to lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species. Mr. Darwin has just sighted some of the observations of the nesting habits of a type of cowbird [Molothrus Bonariensis] written by a naturalist colleague. ""Mr. Hudson is a strong disbeliever in evolution, but he appears to have been much struck by the imperfect instincts of the Molothrus Bonariensis that he quotes my words and asks, 'must we consider these habits not as an especially endowed or created instincts but as small consequences of one general law, namely transitions?' ""I take from the above that Darwin was enjoying the irony of a naturalist from the creationist camp finding it difficult to attribute to God the endowment of the slothful nest making habits to the cowbird. Since the behavior is repugnant it must have been caused by that old nasty evolution stuff (i.e. the work of the devil)."

Or, perhaps you are a student participating in one of nation's modern and progressive science classes, learning about the Origins of Man, but confused by the lack of scientifically observable studies missing from your text books.

103,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48327873-markus,5,"On The Origin of SpeciesDarwin (1809-1882)Darwin published this book in 1859. It is his scientific treaty based on the idea of all organism living on the earth to be descendants from one or several original progenitors.The work is mostly a transcription of the author’s notes throughout his years of study and his famous voyage on the HMS Beagle to the Southern Hemisphere. It had likely been addressed to the quite sceptic scientific community of his time, to demonstrate his idea and to bring supporting material enough to convince and to proof its validity. Apart from the excessively rich scientific vocabulary, the book is pleasant reading. A few quotations will give some insight: ""This Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements, and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence into my accuracy. No doubt errors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone. In considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryonic relations, their geographical distribution, geological successions, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties from other species.”The work is developed in chapters:Variations under Domestications,Variations in Nature,Struggle for existence,Natural selection; or Survival of the fittest,Laws of variation,Difficulties of the theory, Miscellaneous objections to the theory of Natural Selection,Instinct,Hybridism,On the imperfection of the Geological Record,On the Geological Succession of Organic Beings Geographical distribution,Mutual affinities of organic beings, Embryology,Quotations from Recapitulation and Conclusion: ""I see no good reason why the view given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of anyone. It could be just as noble a conception for a Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws. The belief that species were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was believed to be of short duration; and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are apt to assume, that the geological record would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species. Now, things are wholly changed, and almost every naturalist admits the great principle of evolution, over the old belief in the creation of species from the dust of the earth. The laws of Nature, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to the struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural selection, and the Extinction of less-improved forms. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one.”I have much enjoyed reading this book and am glad not to have missed it. I recommend it to anyone interested in Natural History or just in knowledge as such."

At times, it was hard getting through this book, mainly because it's dense and sometimes Darwin tended to drag and not get to the point, but I'm glad I finally read it. However, I think I should have read this at another point of my life - I mean, it was exasperating to read something I had just studied at a biology course I was taking. I still don't regret reading this. If you're considering on whether picking this book or not (yeah, I'm actually recommending it), I suggest you do it between your leisure reading because it can get tedious if you swallow it all at once."

106,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/210123-d-g,5,"My science education left a lot to be desired. I was never taught the Theory of Natural Selection in school but only heard it mentioned when some adults scoffed at it. Thankfully, my natural talents steered me away from a career in Biology or Genetics, so this lack of knowledge didn’t affect my career prospects. It just affected my understanding of the world. I learned years later the basics of the theory but this just piqued my interest about reading the actual book. I always have problems with Victorian authors (very long sentences) so the print version gave me some difficulty. If it weren’t for Richard Dawkins' excellent narration, I don’t know that I could have enjoyed this book as much.I’m almost shocked that I was able to follow the concepts herein as well as I did. I am amazed that Mr. Darwin could write this book (one of the most important in the history of science and the whole world) in such clear, concise way, that a person with minimal understanding of the topic in general could follow along so well. The concepts are explained logically with tons of examples so the reader is not left dangling wondering what he meant. Not only that, but he also writes beautifully and the prose is sometimes as poetic as it is instructive:As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.From the beginning, I understood this wasn’t a book I could listen in one sitting or while doing other things. I took it slowly and that allowed me to think things through. It made me think a lot about our place in the world and how sometimes we think we are above the system when in fact, we are just one creature among millions and not the most important in the grand scheme of nature (if we were to go extinct, the planet will continue merrily along.) It made reflect in our attempts to control nature, to see change as a bad thing, and our hubris that we can keep in check a process that has moved relentlessly forward for millions of years.Darwin was certainly cognizant that his theory wouldn’t be accepted immediately: “Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory.”  But I think he would be surprised by how much discussion there is still going on about the subject, specially given that DNA evidence has already proven he was correct in thinking that every living being sprouted from a single progenitor (mind staggering as it seems.)As I already mentioned, Richard Dawkins is the narrator for this audiobook and he did an amazing job - you could tell he's probably read this book a million times and knows it like the back of his hand. His diction was very precise and clear; and his enthusiasm for the subject was contagious. It almost feels like Darwin is the one speaking. Overall, a must read for anybody with an interest in learning how we came into being. "
107,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Sometimes when I read books with ideas that changed the world, I notice they’re boring. Not because it’s poorly written, archaically worded, or just a boring topic- all untrue- but because the ideas were so influential that the entire book is just one big “duh, yeah, I’m already on board with this, you don’t need to harp on so much, I see what you’re getting at and I agree it makes sense.” (I remember a similar feeling with Singer’s Animal Liberation, for example.)  This is obviously one of those books. If you’ve got a high school diploma, you already understand natural selection, and if you’re interested in biology at all, you probably also understand the evidentiary support/finer tunings of the theory.  Essentially this is like, 700 pages of Darwin giving evidence for his theory by listing out different animals or plants and discussing how the variations imply a common ancestor/his theory and how they disprove his opponents’ arguments. Pigeons with X number of tail feathers, horses with leg stripes, radishes versus rutabagas. Lots and lots and lots of details about things like this.  I’m glad I read it because Darwin is clearly anxious nobody will believe his wild new theory, since he throws so much evidence at the reader. This serves, to me, as a fantastic reminder that this was, in fact, a radical kooky theory at the time and nothing in science should be taken for granted as truth because there is always, always always, a shakeup on the horizon that will make us question everything. And no era is immune to that- every era has thought itself “finally at the truth” and every time we’ve been wrong. As we are now, in ways we can’t even imagine yet."
108,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29868756-katie-bananas,5,"Celebratory 2:00 am review, just great!!! When I finished this, I was definitely clapping my hands!! This is not a story if you are one of those who are mad excited to read it. It's a tome of its size that is equivalent to an encyclopedia with depth, width, and value. It's the densest nonfiction I have read. It is an attempt to read a genre I really wasn't familiar with. Since I got into reading, I believe that nonfiction is one of the genres that is most daunting to me. In 2016, I definitely attempted a few; yet, I never really expected to grab this one off the shelves like that and just read it. It has an encyclopedia feel and it definitely reads like one as well. Charles Darwin is quite the familiar science genius known to students studying biology everywhere. He along with Mendel, the father of genetics, are the monsters for biology making it seemingly hard. As I mentioned above it's not a story, and it's not a simple read or a book for enjoyment. It is also not a list of drone. It's a rather valuable read of its size with historical touches and very good research on animals and all their genres with density and heaviness. The theory of natural selection as studied in class is not well explained by mere professors. I bet these clowns never came to attempt reading this. I'm repeating it's not a novel and a story you read for leisure time. Professors want to finish curricula, and that's why that's the part that's rushed at the end. I dreaded the study of kingdoms and phyla and Darwinism, because it was never properly explained.After reading this, I think my self respect and self esteem both grew at sheer, personal will while experiencing this book. Before reading, my imagination was always centered around the fact that this book is boring and I'll never find it on ebook. Now, I come to say that I was really thankful to my library for providing it online. Natural selection as emphasized, is the pure fact that all animals are picked out in accordance of their strengths and most intricate and distinguishable characteristics to build the up and coming generations. With this critical focus and specific selection comes variability. Variability is the guy who screams so loud, that for instance, a rose and an orchid are not the same, even though they are both very well known beautiful flowers to the sight of our eyes. Different species of dogs and bees evolve to not be the same. Each animal evolves to have their varied kinds and characteristics. I think of it as myself reading a book and loving it at the end. Did I necessarily love each page? Not necessarily, which presents myself as selective; however, I may have liked the book for its content or flow of a story, even though I didn't like a character or two, or even three. This book is my dense pride of 2016. It will mark my last nonfiction of the year, not because I had enough and finished a book; but rather, because of its mere volume, density, and pure heaviness. I intentionally took long breaks to go back and think what I learned, it really was a ton of material!!! This doesn't make it a textbook. It's an awesome encyclopedia full of potential with long lists of animals who were very well researched down to the hairs on their skin to state their merest and very specified difference, as to say: ""We are both redheads, but you specifically have this characteristic pimple or bump, which makes you slightly different"". Natural selection is a dense concept to attain and learn, because of how variability in the varieties are sincerely observed. I had mentioned that I skipped a whole chapter, which I ended up reading at the very end. It was the chapter on the objections against the theory. I was wondering why is this in the middle of the book, rather than at the end? I skipped it at first to first learn about the theory and various research along with all the researchers who helped Darwin writing this book with insights on their research. Objections, I thought came later. The reason why they came in the middle, I later on discovered is for the fact that these particular objections were not covering the whole book, but rather the first few chapters.It was very good, very dense, and a very important scientific classic. It needs a good amount of patience and belief in your progress. I have a different appreciation for animals and plants knowing that the best of its kind supplant all the others, making it really significant and absolutely striking. Seriously? Yes, absolute genius of a volume!! :)"
109,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1496261-cora-judd,5,"Richard Dawkins' narration of this book is excellent -- I enjoyed it immensely, however, without my semester of physical anthropology, the essential points would have required much more mental attention. Dawkins inserts clarifying information throughout the book and while Darwin's writing is wonderfully clear, I think more of Dawkins' notes and updates would have been an enhancement.I was surprised to see how diverse Darwin's background research was and how elegantly he wrote. He anticipated counter-arguments to his ideas and cleanly, systematically eliminated them. As he concluded each level of his argument, the gaps in his knowledge (due to gaps in scientific progress at the time of his being published) required that he make certain logical leaps and assumptions. These were especially interesting because he was invariably correct, as time has shown.Dawkins abridged the book to some degree which makes me leary - I want to know what the author intended the reader to know. And because the subject is still (astoundingly) controversial, abridging anything of this nature will likely invite criticism."
110,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2345961-pollopicu,2,"What in the world made me want to read this Goliath of a science book? My goodness! I guess if I had to search deep within myself I would have to say I wanted to read anything Darwin, just to see what all the fuss was about, but mostly because of the reviews I read on Goodreads. I thought The Origin of Species would turn me into the science-loving person I always thought lurked inside me.The main reason I finished it is because any science book that has had this much publicity deserves to be read and finished.First of all, it contained a considerable amount of text for a study which was only suppose to be a treatise. This book wasn't difficult to read, as many would have you think. It's not. In fact, it's pretty straight forward. But are you interested in reading 700 pages of things having to do with birds, aquatic mammals, cattle, beaks, gills, bills, plumage, fauna, fowl, pollen, eggs, and embryos? Don't get me wrong, I'm as interested to hear where we might have originated from as much as the next person, but if you take the book at face value, who would be interested in reading page after page of detailed observations of animals most of us will live a lifetime without even having encountered and if we do, so what. I say that as a lover of nature. I mean a LOVER of all things outdoors that have to do with looking at stuff, not reading about it. Where I live we often see herons, and gorgeous owls, foxes, snakes, etc, but I don't want to read 700 pages about them. I want to admire them for a while, but then keep it moving.From what I gathered, it seems to me that scientists and naturalists can't even agree on the differences between species and varieties to begin with. A lot of these studies aren't even conclusive, which makes a lot of sense now since it's a book on the THEORY of evolution. I didn't stop to think of the literal definition of the word ""theory"". Had I paused for a moment to give it thought, I would've realized I would be committing weeks to a treatise that is basically speculation. To me that's a huge waste of time when there are so many other books out there to read. Give me history or give me straight up fiction by topics on theory seem pointless to me. Also, the idea that Darwin's theory of evolution was indirectly responsible for the genocide of so many people during the Nazi era is simply horrific. I had no clue when I began reading this book that Hitler was a follower of Darwin's theory, taking it to heart (a bit too much) the supposed superiority of the white race, hence, making all other races inferior, and therefore extinguishing them. The Subtitle of The Species of Origin was suppose to be “The Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life.” Darwin referred to inferior races as ""savages"", and by savages he meant people with darker skin, such as Native Americans and Africans. Darwin, being the prolific and respected scientist he was, influenced many people (through his work) to practice prejudice, racism and oppression. Hitler believed that the human gene pool could be improved by selective breeding, very much like that of cattle in farm breeding, thus protecting the ""superior"" race. This is simply horrifying.In the end I'm glad I read this book, although I hated the actual reading part. Not so much because of what it contains, but because of the role it has played in our history, of which I was clueless about. In the frustration of reading this book, I made the effort to dig for more information about why so many modern day people are still fascinated by it, still not sure, but I did learn a lot from it, and it did inspire me to dig deep into other genocides that have been committed around the world in which this book may or may not have been indirectly responsible for. However, the book was absolutely tedious. It's like reading about a subject you absolutely loath, like sports, or construction. The part of the book that actually cracked me up was chapter XII (Geographical Distribution) because after having read what seemed like 200 pages of that, the next chapter (XIII) was called ""Geographical Distribution continued"", lol. At that point I was delirious and might have lost it. It's very rare for me to purposely not recommend reading what people consider a ""required read"", but this was a tough one. If you want to read it to add it to your library, go ahead, but I'm giving you fair warning, it's laborious like nothing you've ever read. You will have to see for yourself. "
111,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen,3,"3.0 to 3.5 stars. Not anything like what I would call a ""fun"" read, but I am really happy that I finally read this book given the tremendous influence it has had on the history on modern scientific thinking. The book itself, while dry, is fairly accessible and is not bogged down with overly complex scientific jargon. I would read a couple of chapters a day in between my ""pleasure"" reading and it made the book much easier to absorb. Definitely worth reading. "

And we should be proud that we are the only species that has figured out how we came to be."" ~Jerry A. Coyne, Ph.D., University of ChicagoOn the Origin of Species is Darwin laying out his theory of natural selection in precise, laborious detail. He knew quite well many of the objections and arguments this supposition would invoke, and he counters every anticipated antagonism with a barrage of evidence gained from detailed observation and/or astute experimentation. The idea that plant and animal species evolved from common ancestry was an affront to 1859 sensibilities and the courage required to challenge widespread, ingrained superstition and misinformation must have been enormous. And yet, here it is. The imperfect but substantial cornerstone of biology, biochemistry, psychology, genetics, anthropology, neurology, primatology, embryology... the list is immense.

If only people read this by themselves!It was fascinating how the ""missing links"" was explained by Darwin in a context of geology. Most importantly he was indicating towards Tectonics (that was brought into light many years after darwin's time by Alfred Wegener). Clearly, Darwin was way ahead of his contemporaries. I knew it took him years to publish his work (arguably, partially because of psychosomatic dissonance), but the intense work on gathering information and years of research bolsters his point. He indeed wanted to be very sure of the theory. I am amazed by darwin's thought process that seems very instinctive to anyone who grew up studying about evolution ... however, being the forerunner in joining the dots on the same is very nonintuitive which marks his brilliance. Highly recommended to the Creationists. "
114,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21797839-rafael,4,"im just rating this 4 stars because of its complexity, but not for the contents of the book, witch can rightfully be called a piece of art, this has to be the most complex read i had in years, it's a beutifully explained book on evoulution of especies by natural and human selection, it is incredibly detail and meticulously explained, for maximum enjoyment you must know selections and natural order to fully understand this book as well as geography and different science studies, the variety of especies mentioned in this book is very wide and unless you have a picture of each especies or variety you would be fairly lost, this not a book to take easily as i wrongly did at first but it's an stupendous read if you love science, it is very heavy and will challenge you to finish it and is up to you if you do it, for me it is a really complex read but a fulfilling one in the name of science."
115,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"It took me awhile to drag myself into reading this one. People have always commented that it was so dull and that it was convoluted and hard to follow and I have always believed in evolution and found modern books very accessible on the subject so I thought why bother? Then again I have a thing for classics, and as my list of books on evolution grew I started to chide myself that I still had not even read from Darwin's own hand. So I bent to the grain and pulled it out. This book was nothing like what I expected. Absolutely NOTHING like what I expected. If you read this with an open mind, slowly and take each of his points into consideration you find an absolute flawless logic to his argument. It is well presented and actually I find that compared to many scientific articles it is clearly written for the wider audience. Darwin wants you to get it. He wrote as plainly and carefully as he could. He did not propose his idea half assed or hurriedly. I was floored to find that all of my favorite arguments for evolution came straight from the horses mouth as it were. Darwin got it. He really really got it. He went at it from every angle he could, geological time scales, fossils, birds, plants, animals, interactions, sexual selection, selection on islands, selection in various terrains. He broke it down bit by bit and said: Look guys, I hardly wanted to buy this myself but this is how it is. Just look! See for yourself. Make up your own mind. His methodical manner is hard to shy away from. He did not come up with an idea and let others run with it. He did the research, he talked to people, he took it from all angles and presented it in the clearest manner possible. Yes I have to admit that the writing was a bit dry, but the river of content was overflowing, and the proposal was elegant and clear. What a wonderful contribution. I am honored to have read this work and chide myself yet again for my hesitation. "
116,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22315959-morgan,1,"I can now truly say that, having read the Origin of Species, I find the theory of evolution to be complete and utter hogwash. Darwin never truly gives an explanation for how microevolution can realistically extrapolated into macroevolution. Also, when he brings up objections against his theory, he gives an elaborate excuse for why he cannot prove his point rather than proving it. I am still a firm believer in Creation. It is a lot more logical than evolution."

118,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6051061-t-d-whittle,5,"I know the world has not been waiting with bated breath for 160 years to hear my opinion of this marvelous book, but I wanted to add my praise anyway. This is such a beautiful read. Darwin makes his argument for descent through modification of all organic life with such patience, eloquence, and clarity that it's awe inspiring, especially when one bears in mind that DNA and its sure-fire evidence of descent had not been discovered yet. It's truly remarkable that Darwin was right about almost every detail, using only the tools he had to work with in the nineteenth century, his formidable intelligence, and his sparkling intuition. I understand completely now why he is considered one of the few dozen greatest minds of all time, since recorded history.Darwin writes like a dream. He is gracious to and appreciative of his fellow naturalists. He's honest about the limits of what could be known with certainty, and what could be only guessed at. This style of writing in science is a breath of fresh air from a bygone era. I found Darwin's exuberance regarding his subject contagious, and am including a some of my favourite passages below, so that I can remember them.One thing that made the reading a bit tricky is that I do not speak Latin and, even if I did, would not necessarily know the names of plants and animals by their scientific labels; thus, I did not even recognise the names of common animals in my own country: the kangaroo and the platypus! Given that this book was written for Darwin's contemporaries who were laypersons, I wonder how they would have known these names, or if they read Darwin whilst having editions of botanical and zoological binomial nomenclature nearby? I had Google, of course, but found it also helpful to keep charts of geological eras at hand, an excellent globe, and maps of the world reflecting things as they were at the time of Darwin's writing. ""It is a truly wonderful fact—the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity—that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group, in the manner which we everywhere behold—namely, varieties of the same species most closely related together, species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together, forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct genera much less closely related, and genera related in different degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and classes. "" (pps. 170-171)""All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together or separating objects more or less alike.But I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe the arrangement of the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to the other groups, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but that the amount of difference in the several branches or groups, though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which they have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera, families, sections, or orders."" (p. 404)""As all organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived on this earth have to be classed together, and as all have been connected by the finest gradations, the best, or indeed, if our collections were nearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical. Descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the natural system."" (p. 427)""On the view of each organic being and each separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable it is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we wilfully will not understand."" (p. 452)""But the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate steps. The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been formed, and great valleys excavated, by the slow action of the coast-waves., The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations, accumulated during and almost infinite number of generations."" (p.453)On the imperfection of the geological record: ""The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record. The crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made at hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on and unusual concurrence of circumstances, and the blank intervals between the sucdessive stages as having been of vast duration. But we shall be able to gauget with some security the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeeding organic forms. ... "" (p. 457)This passage is so eloquent, and yet I do not believe mankind, at least, has continued to evolve towards perfection. So sadly optimistic: ""Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction fo the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual. When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the past, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity. And of the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species of each genus, and all the species of many genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. We can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to fortell that it will be the common and widely-spread species, belonging to the larger and dominant groups, which will ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Silurian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection."" (p. 459)""Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."" (p. 460)"
119,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1528196-joe,3,"Having finished Origin, I am taking the liberty of adding a few comments at the top of what I posted when I first added it to my ""currently-reading shelf."" To the would-be classics reader who is a bit daunted at the notion of tackling a fourteen chapter science book written in 19th Century technical terms I offer the suggestion that the back half of Origin is purely optional and can be let go. The first six chapters are the most enjoyable. Four is the big one, where Darwin presents the big pitch, with One through Three being the wind-up to prep the audience. Six is fairly unusual in science literature, being an effort to admit problems with the theory and making efforts to address them. Chapter Seven, on instinct, is aumsing but not vital to the core of the work if your attention is already starting to wander. The rest that follow involve technical arguments that may be pointless to most modern readers. To follow why Darwin makes them one would have to conversant in the state of the art in zoology, botany and geology as it was 150 years ago. I skipped much of it.A few points readers with only a casual knowledge of science may take from this book- Evolution predates Darwin, whose contribution is actually the mechanism of natural selection which explains how it works. He also contributed another mechanism, sexual selection, for traits inherited for their value in obtaining mates. Darwin offers an unexpected chuckle in a quote from Aristotle which suggestive of an understanding of something very much like natural selection.>What follows is old commentary.I am reading this one for the historical value, not the science. A big joke is that people of a certain outlook do try to read it for the science so they can refute it. Silly. Origin is as about as state of the art on evolution science as Newton is on 21st Century string theory. Ah, well.What I have found interesting so far is the struggle Darwin goes through to make his argument in the absence of the kind of modern scientific language or terminology that would have made things simple and clear to his readers. Even more interesting is that Darwin had no clue as to the mechanics of inheritance and admitted as much (the discovery of DNA was a long way off in the future), and yet was able to work out so much on his own without that knowledge.Cool factoid: Darwin took his time pondering his theories for many years before suddenly rushing to get them into print. It seems that while he was taking his time another naturalist named Wallace worked out natural selection too...and then wrote to Darwin for help in placing his findings in front of the right experts! You know how the science establishment is about giving credit to the first one to publish and forgetting the also-rans who came to the same conclusions just a tad too late. One party gets into the textbooks of future generations, while the other is lucky to become a footnote.I'll post some stars when I'm done reading."

122,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,3,"Charles Darwin changed the world when he wrote this book.I mean if you think about it logically, no other book has had such a powerful impact on the way humanity views the earth; yes, we have countless religious doctrine, but never before had there been a book that so drastically alternated our perceptions of the mechanisms that are behind our existence. I’m not talking about on a spiritual level, a level of ideas that cannot be scientifically proven or unproven, but on an actual physical level. These ideas weren’t accepted overnight, few things are, but over time they began to be more and more accepted. Even today we still refer to Darwin’s ideas as “the theory of Evolution” despite the fact that it is now empirically proven as to how we got where we are. It is, generally speaking, a culturally accepted idea. The fact that we still refer to something most accept to be fact as a theory is a phenomenon. It’s unusual. Contrary to popular belief, Darwin did not seek to debunk any religious beliefs. In fact, the research he carried out put him in constant confusion about his own Christianity. For a time he believed religion and science could work together; he believed that science helped to explain some of the ideas in creation stories, but eventually he stopped believing. He lost his faith and embraced the logical mind of the scientist; again, he didn’t seek to counter religion. It was just a simple case that over time he could no longer personally and logically believe in it: it could not be proved rationally. As a student of literature, as a lover of stories, history, nature and narrative, I find myself drawn to ideas of religion and science. For anybody to call religion groundless (I say this from my own agnostically driven perspective) is to divulge a massive lack of judgment. Without wanting to offend any atheists, or anybody of faith, we will never know either way which is ultimately right. But, I do most ardently think that we can only begin to understand what it is to be human by reading and exploring the ideas of both religion and science. They have both been perpetuated by man, so I think we owe it to ourselves to try and understand why. Some of you may have noticed how eclectic my reading tastes have become. I pretty much read anything. I have many reading lists-both shortlists and longlists- but four works I simply need to read in my lifetime are The Qur'an (I have a beautiful edition I picked up from a used book store- a late 19th Century edition), The King James Bible (I’ve recently finished genesis), Relativity: The Special and the General Theory by Einstein and A Brief History of Time by Hawkins. The point is, I think in today’s world we need to understand both religion and science. Both parts form a larger part of our society. Well, anyway, that was a rather large digression. I read the origin of species back in 2013 for the first time. My second reading was more of a gloss over of certain key ideas, and a revisit of passages that I flagged down before. The ideas in the book are obviously ground-breaking, though not the first historical example of them. But, for me, this book is more of a slog than leisure driven reading. The writing isn’t great and it is terribly repetitive at times, but I suppose that’s what comes with observing the natural world in such scientific detail. From the findings here Darwin would eventually go on to lay down his full arguments in  The Decent of Man,  a read that sounds more compelling and all encompassing. So it’s another one to add to my list!"
123,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dear Carol,Thank you for your mail, and of course I remember meeting you on the flight last month! It was a very interesting discussion and I'm still thinking about it. The semester has now started here at Creationist U and I am working hard, but I found time to read the book you recommended. And I'm glad I did, because it was really a lot better than I thought it would be.I guess I was expecting Darwin to be like Richard Dawkins, but he was respectful of religious ideas. And it was great that he liked Paley's Natural Theology so much... he says he almost knew it by heart! We read Paley last year in History of Creation Science, and I also thought it was a terrific book. So I could see Darwin was an open-minded person who was prepared to look at both sides of the question. Richard Dawkins could learn a lot from that!The way he sets up his argument is smart. He starts off talking about how stockbreeders can improve their breed - well, I'm a country boy, and I could see he knew his stuff. This is someone who's spent time down at the farm and understands how country people feel about livestock. And I liked that he'd done all that work raising pigeons. Not the kind of scientist who just hangs out at the lab all day. After that, he introduces his Big Idea about the survival of the fittest and he almost made evolution sound sensible. He's a good writer. And then he was honest when he explained all the problems with the theory. He really got me - I was wondering if he was going to mention any of that stuff, and a page later he came out and said just what I was thinking! Nice work, Mr. Darwin. But I did wonder what he was doing, cutting out the ground from under his own feet. He said he could explain things like the eye and how bees could evolve to make honeycombs, but even if he was real good at making his case, I wasn't buying any.So by the halfway mark, I figured he was done, but like ol' Dubya used to say, I misunderestimated him - he'd saved all his best stuff for last. He had some good shots! I got to admit, he made me think. Why does God put the species that look alike in the same place? Like he says, it is weird how you have a mountain range, and there's one kind of animals and plants on one side, and a different kind on the other side. God's ways are inscrutable to us, but why does He care about those mountains? And the islands, they were even worse. He says if you look at the species on a lot of islands, you don't have any mammals there, except you do have bats. Why? I could see where he was going with this one - the bats could blow in off the mainland and evolve, but other mammals couldn't do that. I admit it, I don't have an answer, except maybe God's testing our faith again. But I can see not everyone will like that. I'm still wondering about those bats! Okay Mr. Darwin, I said it already but I'll say it again, you were a smart guy. So how's life at MIT? And I hope you read the book I recommended to you. A Canticle for Leibowitz will show you that faith and science have more in common than you might think!Take care,Bob"
124,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3712181-stephen-m,4,"Edits for NR because I love him that much. This:""This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful not injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic.""We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change, and some species might become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would most seriously affect many of the others. If the country were open on its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. Let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up, if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area been open immigration, these same places would have been seized on by intruders. In such case, ever slight modification, which in the course of ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of improvement. ""We have reason to believe, as stated in the first chapter, that a change in the conditions of life, by specially acting on the reproductive systems, cause or increases variability; and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a changes, and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by giving a better chance of profitable variations occurring; and unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing.""

I'm surprised at how adapted we have become (or at least the segment of those people on the planet who don't reject Darwin's theory of natural selection as counter to their own idea of the way God makes and shakes) to Darwin's revolutionary idea(s). Like with many of the pantheon of scientific geniuses (Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, etc) there was a bit of random chance involved. The ground was ready for Darwin's adapted seed. There were enough scholars and scientists and rationalists around to carry his idea(s) hither and his theory thither. So while this book, and Darwin himself, were both stellar examples of scientific restraint, the force and momentum of OftS can't be under appreciated. It was just the right time and right place for a scientific revolution. Darwin and his little book walked by a labour of scientific mouldywarps who happened to find themselves on the chalk cliffs of science, pushed those sterile hybrids off, and never looked back. Evolve bitches!"

You can't review a historic artefact.This is a fantastic read, even viewed in a completely different way to how it would have been read at the time. It really is amazing how much evolutionary biology Darwin was able to formulate almost a century before Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA. It boggles the mind what Darwin could have been capable of if he'd had access to the last 150 years of genetic research."

If I were lost in an uncivilized world and had only two books, I would want a Webster's dictionary and this Origin of Species. The dictionary to learn word definitions and this book to learn about the flora and fauna around me.

128,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"Too much to unpack here and not an easy read as it was written 150 years ago. Despite all of the knocks against reading Origin for enjoyment, I can only express extreme awe and state the obvious - how much of a genius Darwin was. From his theory of natural selection to glacier theory, to hybrid plants, to fossil theory and a dozen other biological and geological theories that he developed or contributed to, it is remarkable to me how very little Darwin got wrong in a book that was 600 pages long. We live in a science based world, or at least we like to think so, and this man manages to remain so relevant. It is the scientific method at its best, one part rigorous logic, one part observation, and one part intuition. The recipe works."
129,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,4,"Decry or applaud it, there's no question this work has had a profound effect not just on science, but the culture at large. What I wouldn't read this book for is the science, or in an effort to either defend or refute the argument for evolution. The core of Darwin's argument certainly is still what was taught in my Catholic high school biology class (taught by a nun). In a nutshell, the theory is that given there are wide-ranging subtle Variations among organisms, the Malthusian Struggle for Existence causes by means of Natural Selection of the inheritable traits that are the best Adaptations to the environment the Origin of Species or as Darwin calls it, the ""theory of descent with modification.""But, after all, this book is now over 150 years old. Science is about explaining natural phenomenon and correcting mistakes through observation, experimentation and falsification--not dogma--and so is always a moving target. I know that. But I still raised an eyebrow when in the first chapter of the book Darwin said he believed the ""most frequent cause of variability"" was caused by the experiences of the parents before conception--such as cows' udders being larger in countries where they're milked because the habit of milking by itself alters in the reproductive organs what is inherited by the next generation. WTF Darwin? When Darwin first propounded his theory of evolution (a word never used in the book by the way) through natural selection, Mendel had yet to discover the basic principles of genetics in his experiments with peas and Watson and Crick had yet to unravel the structure of DNA. Nor was continental drift known and understood, so there were notable gaps in Darwin's reasoning that has since been filled. Stephen Jay Gould, one of the staunchest defenders and popularizers of evolution is famous within science particularly for where he differs from Darwin. Darwin thought changes in species were very gradual. Gould favors ""punctuated equilibrium"" where there are rapid changes followed by long periods of stability. That's why scientists today talk of the ""theory of evolution,"" not of ""Darwinism"" as if a scientific principle is an unchanging creed and Origin of Species scripture.So, the book is dated and filled with lots of details I'm sure are just plain wrong and might be onerous to unlearn. That does make me reluctant to give this book top marks despite its profound impact. Someone interested in modern evolutionary science would be better off picking up a copy of a book by Jared Diamond, Richard Dawkins, Carl Sagan (although by now I suppose his very readable Dragons of Eden is dated) or Stephen Jay Gould. So, was there no value in reading On the Origin of Species? I wouldn't say that. It's surprisingly readable--or at least understandable. There are definitely dry passages that were a slog to get through, my eyes glazing over as Darwin gave example after exhaustive example to make his points. However, I couldn't help but be impressed by the knowledge of nature shown by his wide-ranging examples from every continent from ants and bees and algae to pigeons to zebras. Given the way he cited various authorities and spoke about his own experiments, I definitely felt that here was a master generalist and enthusiast on nature. Moreover Darwin does have a gift for metaphor and illustrative examples. I was particularly taken by his explanation of ""inter-crossing"" and the function of sex in creating biological diversity. I also was struck by how cautious and civil in tone Darwin is in his arguments, devoting an entire chapter on what he saw could be the flaws and holes in his theory--particularly the issues of transitions between species and intermediate forms. Bottom line? Arguably this specific book had as much influence on the literature and politics of the next century as Freud or Marx, so I think there is historical value in reading this, preferably in the first edition (which is what I read) that exploded upon the world in 1859."

""If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from feeling the benefit of this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third stage.""
On the Origin of Species is one of the most important books ever written. Although a lot of people-scientists, naturalists and the like-were coming to the same kind of conclusions, Darwin was one of the first who wrote it all down in a profound and concise manner and used his influence and friends to make it a well-known theory: the theory of evolution.There is only one thing you need to know before you read this, and that is that Charles Darwin was a very religious man. This is a five-star worthy book, but my ignorance of this fact caused me to be so infuriated by the end that I couldn't bring myself to rate it higher. It is written exquisitely: if you've read anything particularly science-related in this day and age you will notice how science-related it is. The words, the terms, they're all very much science-related and it can be so difficult to really understand and comprehend what you're reading because it's almost in another language.This is written very much in the way any Victorian novel would have been written. There is a smattering of Latin terms, but for the most part it is easy to understand if you get in the right frame of mind as you would a Classic. It can be heavy going, however, as the paragraphs are long and often repetitive, but his thoughts on pigeons are the most endearing things I've come across: this is Victorian science and it's all about pigeons.To go back to why I only rated it three stars: throughout at no point did Darwin mention God or the creation of the world, except perhaps in very subtle reference and the theory of evolution and instinct reigns supreme, until the very end when he concludes that God did not create the world 1859 years, but millions of years ago, instead, and that all current flora and fauna are descended from the original God-created animals. I should have expected something like this but I did not and that annoyed me more than it should have. Of course, it makes the entire thing that much more impressive, though the horrific experience Darwin must have gone through as he tried to make a religious-belief co-live with a scientific frame of mind would have been supremely agonising. It's wholly my fault for this ignorance, but I still can't bring myself to heighten it.It's still one of the most important books ever written and its legacy will never become diminished, but it is often repetitive and sometimes out-dated with quite a lengthy part about geology which is fairly unremarkable, but his amusing and enjoyable experiments with flowers and his views on pigeons are just a delight.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy"
131,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"My book group selected this book for discussion probably because of the historic impact it has had on the field of science. However, I found it to be very worthy of respect from a literary viewpoint. Charles Darwin's writing comes across as a methodical thinker and patient explainer to many recalcitrant readers who are determined not to believe a word he says. He had me convinced after only a couple dozen pages, but he kept doing what seemed to me to be piling on observation after observation, explanation after explanation, until after a while I felt like crying out, ""Enough already, I believe!"" Frankly, I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge about the natural world already accumulated by the middle of the 19th century as demonstrated by this book. There are obvious things poor old Darwin didn't know about, one of them being the laws of genealogy discovered by Gregor Johann Mendel. Mendel was a contemporary of Darwin, and I have heard that a published copy of Mendel's study was on Darwin's book shelves but it hadn't been opened or read. Of course Darwin wasn't the only person who ignored Mendel. Mendel's work wasn't appreciated for its contribution to understanding of inherited traits until after his death. Meanwhile Darwin is writing this book giving many observations regarding the variability of crossings of various plants and animals, but doesn't understand why.Also, Darwin was plagued with physicists of the time who calculated that earth couldn't be as old as needed for Darwin's theory of natural selection to accomplish all the required changes. The physicists were basing their calculations of the rate cooling of the core of the earth. Of course they were wrong; what they didn't know about was radioactive decay which gives off heat they weren't making allowances for. It turns out the earth is even older than Darwin would have guessed.And of course the really big advance of science that Darwin didn't know about was the DNA double helix. Darwin insists that life forms need to be classed according to genealogy, and he speculates that in the future scientists will be able to classify life forms more accurately as more knowledge is obtained about them. Darwin would be amazed to know how precisely genealogy can be determined these days. For example, it can be determined that humans are more closely related to fungi than to photosynthetic plants.I listened to the audio version of this book. This is an example of a book that is much easier to listen to than to read because of all the big Latin words used in describing species. Having the words read aloud made them fit into the context of the sentence much better than if I were trying to read (and probably skip over) those unfamiliar words. There were six editions of ""Origin of Species"" in Darwin's life time. It could be argued that the 1859 edition is the second best version of this book with the 1860 British edition being slightly better in that it contains some insignificant, but non-substantive, corrections. The editions of 1861, 1866, 1869, and 1872 are all inferior. In them Darwin made changes and expansions in an effort to meet the objections that arose during those times. The modifications expanded the book and clouded the argument. Since most of the objections that were raised would be regarded as silly today, Darwin's arguments against them are of interest for social history, but not for Darwin's theory. I think that most published copies today are based on the 1872 edition. If you have an earlier edition you will find that it is shorter and, as indicated above, is probably better.The following quotation is from the sixth edition and not in the earlier editions. It is from a section of the book on instincts and follows a couple paragraphs discussing the habit of some birds to lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species. Mr. Darwin has just sighted some of the observations of the nesting habits of a type of cowbird [Molothrus Bonariensis] written by a naturalist colleague. ""Mr. Hudson is a strong disbeliever in evolution, but he appears to have been much struck by the imperfect instincts of the Molothrus Bonariensis that he quotes my words and asks, 'must we consider these habits not as an especially endowed or created instincts but as small consequences of one general law, namely transitions?' ""I take from the above that Darwin was enjoying the irony of a naturalist from the creationist camp finding it difficult to attribute to God the endowment of the slothful nest making habits to the cowbird. Since the behavior is repugnant it must have been caused by that old nasty evolution stuff (i.e. the work of the devil)."

Or, perhaps you are a student participating in one of nation's modern and progressive science classes, learning about the Origins of Man, but confused by the lack of scientifically observable studies missing from your text books.

133,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48327873-markus,5,"On The Origin of SpeciesDarwin (1809-1882)Darwin published this book in 1859. It is his scientific treaty based on the idea of all organism living on the earth to be descendants from one or several original progenitors.The work is mostly a transcription of the author’s notes throughout his years of study and his famous voyage on the HMS Beagle to the Southern Hemisphere. It had likely been addressed to the quite sceptic scientific community of his time, to demonstrate his idea and to bring supporting material enough to convince and to proof its validity. Apart from the excessively rich scientific vocabulary, the book is pleasant reading. A few quotations will give some insight: ""This Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements, and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence into my accuracy. No doubt errors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone. In considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryonic relations, their geographical distribution, geological successions, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties from other species.”The work is developed in chapters:Variations under Domestications,Variations in Nature,Struggle for existence,Natural selection; or Survival of the fittest,Laws of variation,Difficulties of the theory, Miscellaneous objections to the theory of Natural Selection,Instinct,Hybridism,On the imperfection of the Geological Record,On the Geological Succession of Organic Beings Geographical distribution,Mutual affinities of organic beings, Embryology,Quotations from Recapitulation and Conclusion: ""I see no good reason why the view given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of anyone. It could be just as noble a conception for a Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws. The belief that species were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was believed to be of short duration; and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are apt to assume, that the geological record would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species. Now, things are wholly changed, and almost every naturalist admits the great principle of evolution, over the old belief in the creation of species from the dust of the earth. The laws of Nature, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to the struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural selection, and the Extinction of less-improved forms. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one.”I have much enjoyed reading this book and am glad not to have missed it. I recommend it to anyone interested in Natural History or just in knowledge as such."

At times, it was hard getting through this book, mainly because it's dense and sometimes Darwin tended to drag and not get to the point, but I'm glad I finally read it. However, I think I should have read this at another point of my life - I mean, it was exasperating to read something I had just studied at a biology course I was taking. I still don't regret reading this. If you're considering on whether picking this book or not (yeah, I'm actually recommending it), I suggest you do it between your leisure reading because it can get tedious if you swallow it all at once."

136,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/210123-d-g,5,"My science education left a lot to be desired. I was never taught the Theory of Natural Selection in school but only heard it mentioned when some adults scoffed at it. Thankfully, my natural talents steered me away from a career in Biology or Genetics, so this lack of knowledge didn’t affect my career prospects. It just affected my understanding of the world. I learned years later the basics of the theory but this just piqued my interest about reading the actual book. I always have problems with Victorian authors (very long sentences) so the print version gave me some difficulty. If it weren’t for Richard Dawkins' excellent narration, I don’t know that I could have enjoyed this book as much.I’m almost shocked that I was able to follow the concepts herein as well as I did. I am amazed that Mr. Darwin could write this book (one of the most important in the history of science and the whole world) in such clear, concise way, that a person with minimal understanding of the topic in general could follow along so well. The concepts are explained logically with tons of examples so the reader is not left dangling wondering what he meant. Not only that, but he also writes beautifully and the prose is sometimes as poetic as it is instructive:As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.From the beginning, I understood this wasn’t a book I could listen in one sitting or while doing other things. I took it slowly and that allowed me to think things through. It made me think a lot about our place in the world and how sometimes we think we are above the system when in fact, we are just one creature among millions and not the most important in the grand scheme of nature (if we were to go extinct, the planet will continue merrily along.) It made reflect in our attempts to control nature, to see change as a bad thing, and our hubris that we can keep in check a process that has moved relentlessly forward for millions of years.Darwin was certainly cognizant that his theory wouldn’t be accepted immediately: “Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory.”  But I think he would be surprised by how much discussion there is still going on about the subject, specially given that DNA evidence has already proven he was correct in thinking that every living being sprouted from a single progenitor (mind staggering as it seems.)As I already mentioned, Richard Dawkins is the narrator for this audiobook and he did an amazing job - you could tell he's probably read this book a million times and knows it like the back of his hand. His diction was very precise and clear; and his enthusiasm for the subject was contagious. It almost feels like Darwin is the one speaking. Overall, a must read for anybody with an interest in learning how we came into being. "

Not because it’s poorly written, archaically worded, or just a boring topic- all untrue- but because the ideas were so influential that the entire book is just one big “duh, yeah, I’m already on board with this, you don’t need to harp on so much, I see what you’re getting at and I agree it makes sense.” (I remember a similar feeling with Singer’s Animal Liberation, for example.)  This is obviously one of those books. If you’ve got a high school diploma, you already understand natural selection, and if you’re interested in biology at all, you probably also understand the evidentiary support/finer tunings of the theory.  Essentially this is like, 700 pages of Darwin giving evidence for his theory by listing out different animals or plants and discussing how the variations imply a common ancestor/his theory and how they disprove his opponents’ arguments. Pigeons with X number of tail feathers, horses with leg stripes, radishes versus rutabagas. Lots and lots and lots of details about things like this.  I’m glad I read it because Darwin is clearly anxious nobody will believe his wild new theory, since he throws so much evidence at the reader. This serves, to me, as a fantastic reminder that this was, in fact, a radical kooky theory at the time and nothing in science should be taken for granted as truth because there is always, always always, a shakeup on the horizon that will make us question everything. And no era is immune to that- every era has thought itself “finally at the truth” and every time we’ve been wrong. As we are now, in ways we can’t even imagine yet."
138,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29868756-katie-bananas,5,"Celebratory 2:00 am review, just great!!! When I finished this, I was definitely clapping my hands!! This is not a story if you are one of those who are mad excited to read it. It's a tome of its size that is equivalent to an encyclopedia with depth, width, and value. It's the densest nonfiction I have read. It is an attempt to read a genre I really wasn't familiar with. Since I got into reading, I believe that nonfiction is one of the genres that is most daunting to me. In 2016, I definitely attempted a few; yet, I never really expected to grab this one off the shelves like that and just read it. It has an encyclopedia feel and it definitely reads like one as well. Charles Darwin is quite the familiar science genius known to students studying biology everywhere. He along with Mendel, the father of genetics, are the monsters for biology making it seemingly hard. As I mentioned above it's not a story, and it's not a simple read or a book for enjoyment. It is also not a list of drone. It's a rather valuable read of its size with historical touches and very good research on animals and all their genres with density and heaviness. The theory of natural selection as studied in class is not well explained by mere professors. I bet these clowns never came to attempt reading this. I'm repeating it's not a novel and a story you read for leisure time. Professors want to finish curricula, and that's why that's the part that's rushed at the end. I dreaded the study of kingdoms and phyla and Darwinism, because it was never properly explained.After reading this, I think my self respect and self esteem both grew at sheer, personal will while experiencing this book. Before reading, my imagination was always centered around the fact that this book is boring and I'll never find it on ebook. Now, I come to say that I was really thankful to my library for providing it online. Natural selection as emphasized, is the pure fact that all animals are picked out in accordance of their strengths and most intricate and distinguishable characteristics to build the up and coming generations. With this critical focus and specific selection comes variability. Variability is the guy who screams so loud, that for instance, a rose and an orchid are not the same, even though they are both very well known beautiful flowers to the sight of our eyes. Different species of dogs and bees evolve to not be the same. Each animal evolves to have their varied kinds and characteristics. I think of it as myself reading a book and loving it at the end. Did I necessarily love each page? Not necessarily, which presents myself as selective; however, I may have liked the book for its content or flow of a story, even though I didn't like a character or two, or even three. This book is my dense pride of 2016. It will mark my last nonfiction of the year, not because I had enough and finished a book; but rather, because of its mere volume, density, and pure heaviness. I intentionally took long breaks to go back and think what I learned, it really was a ton of material!!! This doesn't make it a textbook. It's an awesome encyclopedia full of potential with long lists of animals who were very well researched down to the hairs on their skin to state their merest and very specified difference, as to say: ""We are both redheads, but you specifically have this characteristic pimple or bump, which makes you slightly different"". Natural selection is a dense concept to attain and learn, because of how variability in the varieties are sincerely observed. I had mentioned that I skipped a whole chapter, which I ended up reading at the very end. It was the chapter on the objections against the theory. I was wondering why is this in the middle of the book, rather than at the end? I skipped it at first to first learn about the theory and various research along with all the researchers who helped Darwin writing this book with insights on their research. Objections, I thought came later. The reason why they came in the middle, I later on discovered is for the fact that these particular objections were not covering the whole book, but rather the first few chapters.It was very good, very dense, and a very important scientific classic. It needs a good amount of patience and belief in your progress. I have a different appreciation for animals and plants knowing that the best of its kind supplant all the others, making it really significant and absolutely striking. Seriously? Yes, absolute genius of a volume!! :)"
139,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1496261-cora-judd,5,"Richard Dawkins' narration of this book is excellent -- I enjoyed it immensely, however, without my semester of physical anthropology, the essential points would have required much more mental attention. Dawkins inserts clarifying information throughout the book and while Darwin's writing is wonderfully clear, I think more of Dawkins' notes and updates would have been an enhancement.I was surprised to see how diverse Darwin's background research was and how elegantly he wrote. He anticipated counter-arguments to his ideas and cleanly, systematically eliminated them. As he concluded each level of his argument, the gaps in his knowledge (due to gaps in scientific progress at the time of his being published) required that he make certain logical leaps and assumptions. These were especially interesting because he was invariably correct, as time has shown.Dawkins abridged the book to some degree which makes me leary - I want to know what the author intended the reader to know. And because the subject is still (astoundingly) controversial, abridging anything of this nature will likely invite criticism."
140,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2345961-pollopicu,2,"What in the world made me want to read this Goliath of a science book? My goodness! I guess if I had to search deep within myself I would have to say I wanted to read anything Darwin, just to see what all the fuss was about, but mostly because of the reviews I read on Goodreads. I thought The Origin of Species would turn me into the science-loving person I always thought lurked inside me.The main reason I finished it is because any science book that has had this much publicity deserves to be read and finished.First of all, it contained a considerable amount of text for a study which was only suppose to be a treatise. This book wasn't difficult to read, as many would have you think. It's not. In fact, it's pretty straight forward. But are you interested in reading 700 pages of things having to do with birds, aquatic mammals, cattle, beaks, gills, bills, plumage, fauna, fowl, pollen, eggs, and embryos? Don't get me wrong, I'm as interested to hear where we might have originated from as much as the next person, but if you take the book at face value, who would be interested in reading page after page of detailed observations of animals most of us will live a lifetime without even having encountered and if we do, so what. I say that as a lover of nature. I mean a LOVER of all things outdoors that have to do with looking at stuff, not reading about it. Where I live we often see herons, and gorgeous owls, foxes, snakes, etc, but I don't want to read 700 pages about them. I want to admire them for a while, but then keep it moving.From what I gathered, it seems to me that scientists and naturalists can't even agree on the differences between species and varieties to begin with. A lot of these studies aren't even conclusive, which makes a lot of sense now since it's a book on the THEORY of evolution. I didn't stop to think of the literal definition of the word ""theory"". Had I paused for a moment to give it thought, I would've realized I would be committing weeks to a treatise that is basically speculation. To me that's a huge waste of time when there are so many other books out there to read. Give me history or give me straight up fiction by topics on theory seem pointless to me. Also, the idea that Darwin's theory of evolution was indirectly responsible for the genocide of so many people during the Nazi era is simply horrific. I had no clue when I began reading this book that Hitler was a follower of Darwin's theory, taking it to heart (a bit too much) the supposed superiority of the white race, hence, making all other races inferior, and therefore extinguishing them. The Subtitle of The Species of Origin was suppose to be “The Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life.” Darwin referred to inferior races as ""savages"", and by savages he meant people with darker skin, such as Native Americans and Africans. Darwin, being the prolific and respected scientist he was, influenced many people (through his work) to practice prejudice, racism and oppression. Hitler believed that the human gene pool could be improved by selective breeding, very much like that of cattle in farm breeding, thus protecting the ""superior"" race. This is simply horrifying.In the end I'm glad I read this book, although I hated the actual reading part. Not so much because of what it contains, but because of the role it has played in our history, of which I was clueless about. In the frustration of reading this book, I made the effort to dig for more information about why so many modern day people are still fascinated by it, still not sure, but I did learn a lot from it, and it did inspire me to dig deep into other genocides that have been committed around the world in which this book may or may not have been indirectly responsible for. However, the book was absolutely tedious. It's like reading about a subject you absolutely loath, like sports, or construction. The part of the book that actually cracked me up was chapter XII (Geographical Distribution) because after having read what seemed like 200 pages of that, the next chapter (XIII) was called ""Geographical Distribution continued"", lol. At that point I was delirious and might have lost it. It's very rare for me to purposely not recommend reading what people consider a ""required read"", but this was a tough one. If you want to read it to add it to your library, go ahead, but I'm giving you fair warning, it's laborious like nothing you've ever read. You will have to see for yourself. "
141,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen,3,"3.0 to 3.5 stars. Not anything like what I would call a ""fun"" read, but I am really happy that I finally read this book given the tremendous influence it has had on the history on modern scientific thinking. The book itself, while dry, is fairly accessible and is not bogged down with overly complex scientific jargon. I would read a couple of chapters a day in between my ""pleasure"" reading and it made the book much easier to absorb. Definitely worth reading. "

And we should be proud that we are the only species that has figured out how we came to be."" ~Jerry A. Coyne, Ph.D., University of ChicagoOn the Origin of Species is Darwin laying out his theory of natural selection in precise, laborious detail. He knew quite well many of the objections and arguments this supposition would invoke, and he counters every anticipated antagonism with a barrage of evidence gained from detailed observation and/or astute experimentation. The idea that plant and animal species evolved from common ancestry was an affront to 1859 sensibilities and the courage required to challenge widespread, ingrained superstition and misinformation must have been enormous. And yet, here it is. The imperfect but substantial cornerstone of biology, biochemistry, psychology, genetics, anthropology, neurology, primatology, embryology... the list is immense.

If only people read this by themselves!It was fascinating how the ""missing links"" was explained by Darwin in a context of geology. Most importantly he was indicating towards Tectonics (that was brought into light many years after darwin's time by Alfred Wegener). Clearly, Darwin was way ahead of his contemporaries. I knew it took him years to publish his work (arguably, partially because of psychosomatic dissonance), but the intense work on gathering information and years of research bolsters his point. He indeed wanted to be very sure of the theory. I am amazed by darwin's thought process that seems very instinctive to anyone who grew up studying about evolution ... however, being the forerunner in joining the dots on the same is very nonintuitive which marks his brilliance. Highly recommended to the Creationists. "
144,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21797839-rafael,4,"im just rating this 4 stars because of its complexity, but not for the contents of the book, witch can rightfully be called a piece of art, this has to be the most complex read i had in years, it's a beutifully explained book on evoulution of especies by natural and human selection, it is incredibly detail and meticulously explained, for maximum enjoyment you must know selections and natural order to fully understand this book as well as geography and different science studies, the variety of especies mentioned in this book is very wide and unless you have a picture of each especies or variety you would be fairly lost, this not a book to take easily as i wrongly did at first but it's an stupendous read if you love science, it is very heavy and will challenge you to finish it and is up to you if you do it, for me it is a really complex read but a fulfilling one in the name of science."
145,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"It took me awhile to drag myself into reading this one. People have always commented that it was so dull and that it was convoluted and hard to follow and I have always believed in evolution and found modern books very accessible on the subject so I thought why bother? Then again I have a thing for classics, and as my list of books on evolution grew I started to chide myself that I still had not even read from Darwin's own hand. So I bent to the grain and pulled it out. This book was nothing like what I expected. Absolutely NOTHING like what I expected. If you read this with an open mind, slowly and take each of his points into consideration you find an absolute flawless logic to his argument. It is well presented and actually I find that compared to many scientific articles it is clearly written for the wider audience. Darwin wants you to get it. He wrote as plainly and carefully as he could. He did not propose his idea half assed or hurriedly. I was floored to find that all of my favorite arguments for evolution came straight from the horses mouth as it were. Darwin got it. He really really got it. He went at it from every angle he could, geological time scales, fossils, birds, plants, animals, interactions, sexual selection, selection on islands, selection in various terrains. He broke it down bit by bit and said: Look guys, I hardly wanted to buy this myself but this is how it is. Just look! See for yourself. Make up your own mind. His methodical manner is hard to shy away from. He did not come up with an idea and let others run with it. He did the research, he talked to people, he took it from all angles and presented it in the clearest manner possible. Yes I have to admit that the writing was a bit dry, but the river of content was overflowing, and the proposal was elegant and clear. What a wonderful contribution. I am honored to have read this work and chide myself yet again for my hesitation. "
146,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22315959-morgan,1,"I can now truly say that, having read the Origin of Species, I find the theory of evolution to be complete and utter hogwash. Darwin never truly gives an explanation for how microevolution can realistically extrapolated into macroevolution. Also, when he brings up objections against his theory, he gives an elaborate excuse for why he cannot prove his point rather than proving it. I am still a firm believer in Creation. It is a lot more logical than evolution."

148,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6051061-t-d-whittle,5,"I know the world has not been waiting with bated breath for 160 years to hear my opinion of this marvelous book, but I wanted to add my praise anyway. This is such a beautiful read. Darwin makes his argument for descent through modification of all organic life with such patience, eloquence, and clarity that it's awe inspiring, especially when one bears in mind that DNA and its sure-fire evidence of descent had not been discovered yet. It's truly remarkable that Darwin was right about almost every detail, using only the tools he had to work with in the nineteenth century, his formidable intelligence, and his sparkling intuition. I understand completely now why he is considered one of the few dozen greatest minds of all time, since recorded history.Darwin writes like a dream. He is gracious to and appreciative of his fellow naturalists. He's honest about the limits of what could be known with certainty, and what could be only guessed at. This style of writing in science is a breath of fresh air from a bygone era. I found Darwin's exuberance regarding his subject contagious, and am including a some of my favourite passages below, so that I can remember them.One thing that made the reading a bit tricky is that I do not speak Latin and, even if I did, would not necessarily know the names of plants and animals by their scientific labels; thus, I did not even recognise the names of common animals in my own country: the kangaroo and the platypus! Given that this book was written for Darwin's contemporaries who were laypersons, I wonder how they would have known these names, or if they read Darwin whilst having editions of botanical and zoological binomial nomenclature nearby? I had Google, of course, but found it also helpful to keep charts of geological eras at hand, an excellent globe, and maps of the world reflecting things as they were at the time of Darwin's writing. ""It is a truly wonderful fact—the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity—that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group, in the manner which we everywhere behold—namely, varieties of the same species most closely related together, species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together, forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct genera much less closely related, and genera related in different degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and classes. "" (pps. 170-171)""All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together or separating objects more or less alike.But I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe the arrangement of the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to the other groups, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but that the amount of difference in the several branches or groups, though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which they have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera, families, sections, or orders."" (p. 404)""As all organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived on this earth have to be classed together, and as all have been connected by the finest gradations, the best, or indeed, if our collections were nearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical. Descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the natural system."" (p. 427)""On the view of each organic being and each separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable it is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we wilfully will not understand."" (p. 452)""But the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate steps. The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been formed, and great valleys excavated, by the slow action of the coast-waves., The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations, accumulated during and almost infinite number of generations."" (p.453)On the imperfection of the geological record: ""The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record. The crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made at hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on and unusual concurrence of circumstances, and the blank intervals between the sucdessive stages as having been of vast duration. But we shall be able to gauget with some security the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeeding organic forms. ... "" (p. 457)This passage is so eloquent, and yet I do not believe mankind, at least, has continued to evolve towards perfection. So sadly optimistic: ""Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction fo the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual. When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the past, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity. And of the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species of each genus, and all the species of many genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. We can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to fortell that it will be the common and widely-spread species, belonging to the larger and dominant groups, which will ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Silurian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection."" (p. 459)""Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."" (p. 460)"

To the would-be classics reader who is a bit daunted at the notion of tackling a fourteen chapter science book written in 19th Century technical terms I offer the suggestion that the back half of Origin is purely optional and can be let go. The first six chapters are the most enjoyable. Four is the big one, where Darwin presents the big pitch, with One through Three being the wind-up to prep the audience. Six is fairly unusual in science literature, being an effort to admit problems with the theory and making efforts to address them. Chapter Seven, on instinct, is aumsing but not vital to the core of the work if your attention is already starting to wander. The rest that follow involve technical arguments that may be pointless to most modern readers. To follow why Darwin makes them one would have to conversant in the state of the art in zoology, botany and geology as it was 150 years ago. I skipped much of it.A few points readers with only a casual knowledge of science may take from this book- Evolution predates Darwin, whose contribution is actually the mechanism of natural selection which explains how it works. He also contributed another mechanism, sexual selection, for traits inherited for their value in obtaining mates. Darwin offers an unexpected chuckle in a quote from Aristotle which suggestive of an understanding of something very much like natural selection.>What follows is old commentary.I am reading this one for the historical value, not the science. A big joke is that people of a certain outlook do try to read it for the science so they can refute it. Silly. Origin is as about as state of the art on evolution science as Newton is on 21st Century string theory. Ah, well.What I have found interesting so far is the struggle Darwin goes through to make his argument in the absence of the kind of modern scientific language or terminology that would have made things simple and clear to his readers. Even more interesting is that Darwin had no clue as to the mechanics of inheritance and admitted as much (the discovery of DNA was a long way off in the future), and yet was able to work out so much on his own without that knowledge.Cool factoid: Darwin took his time pondering his theories for many years before suddenly rushing to get them into print. It seems that while he was taking his time another naturalist named Wallace worked out natural selection too...and then wrote to Darwin for help in placing his findings in front of the right experts! You know how the science establishment is about giving credit to the first one to publish and forgetting the also-rans who came to the same conclusions just a tad too late. One party gets into the textbooks of future generations, while the other is lucky to become a footnote.I'll post some stars when I'm done reading."

152,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,3,"Charles Darwin changed the world when he wrote this book.I mean if you think about it logically, no other book has had such a powerful impact on the way humanity views the earth; yes, we have countless religious doctrine, but never before had there been a book that so drastically alternated our perceptions of the mechanisms that are behind our existence. I’m not talking about on a spiritual level, a level of ideas that cannot be scientifically proven or unproven, but on an actual physical level. These ideas weren’t accepted overnight, few things are, but over time they began to be more and more accepted. Even today we still refer to Darwin’s ideas as “the theory of Evolution” despite the fact that it is now empirically proven as to how we got where we are. It is, generally speaking, a culturally accepted idea. The fact that we still refer to something most accept to be fact as a theory is a phenomenon. It’s unusual. Contrary to popular belief, Darwin did not seek to debunk any religious beliefs. In fact, the research he carried out put him in constant confusion about his own Christianity. For a time he believed religion and science could work together; he believed that science helped to explain some of the ideas in creation stories, but eventually he stopped believing. He lost his faith and embraced the logical mind of the scientist; again, he didn’t seek to counter religion. It was just a simple case that over time he could no longer personally and logically believe in it: it could not be proved rationally. As a student of literature, as a lover of stories, history, nature and narrative, I find myself drawn to ideas of religion and science. For anybody to call religion groundless (I say this from my own agnostically driven perspective) is to divulge a massive lack of judgment. Without wanting to offend any atheists, or anybody of faith, we will never know either way which is ultimately right. But, I do most ardently think that we can only begin to understand what it is to be human by reading and exploring the ideas of both religion and science. They have both been perpetuated by man, so I think we owe it to ourselves to try and understand why. Some of you may have noticed how eclectic my reading tastes have become. I pretty much read anything. I have many reading lists-both shortlists and longlists- but four works I simply need to read in my lifetime are The Qur'an (I have a beautiful edition I picked up from a used book store- a late 19th Century edition), The King James Bible (I’ve recently finished genesis), Relativity: The Special and the General Theory by Einstein and A Brief History of Time by Hawkins. The point is, I think in today’s world we need to understand both religion and science. Both parts form a larger part of our society. Well, anyway, that was a rather large digression. I read the origin of species back in 2013 for the first time. My second reading was more of a gloss over of certain key ideas, and a revisit of passages that I flagged down before. The ideas in the book are obviously ground-breaking, though not the first historical example of them. But, for me, this book is more of a slog than leisure driven reading. The writing isn’t great and it is terribly repetitive at times, but I suppose that’s what comes with observing the natural world in such scientific detail. From the findings here Darwin would eventually go on to lay down his full arguments in  The Decent of Man,  a read that sounds more compelling and all encompassing. So it’s another one to add to my list!"
153,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dear Carol,Thank you for your mail, and of course I remember meeting you on the flight last month! It was a very interesting discussion and I'm still thinking about it. The semester has now started here at Creationist U and I am working hard, but I found time to read the book you recommended. And I'm glad I did, because it was really a lot better than I thought it would be.I guess I was expecting Darwin to be like Richard Dawkins, but he was respectful of religious ideas. And it was great that he liked Paley's Natural Theology so much... he says he almost knew it by heart! We read Paley last year in History of Creation Science, and I also thought it was a terrific book. So I could see Darwin was an open-minded person who was prepared to look at both sides of the question. Richard Dawkins could learn a lot from that!The way he sets up his argument is smart. He starts off talking about how stockbreeders can improve their breed - well, I'm a country boy, and I could see he knew his stuff. This is someone who's spent time down at the farm and understands how country people feel about livestock. And I liked that he'd done all that work raising pigeons. Not the kind of scientist who just hangs out at the lab all day. After that, he introduces his Big Idea about the survival of the fittest and he almost made evolution sound sensible. He's a good writer. And then he was honest when he explained all the problems with the theory. He really got me - I was wondering if he was going to mention any of that stuff, and a page later he came out and said just what I was thinking! Nice work, Mr. Darwin. But I did wonder what he was doing, cutting out the ground from under his own feet. He said he could explain things like the eye and how bees could evolve to make honeycombs, but even if he was real good at making his case, I wasn't buying any.So by the halfway mark, I figured he was done, but like ol' Dubya used to say, I misunderestimated him - he'd saved all his best stuff for last. He had some good shots! I got to admit, he made me think. Why does God put the species that look alike in the same place? Like he says, it is weird how you have a mountain range, and there's one kind of animals and plants on one side, and a different kind on the other side. God's ways are inscrutable to us, but why does He care about those mountains? And the islands, they were even worse. He says if you look at the species on a lot of islands, you don't have any mammals there, except you do have bats. Why? I could see where he was going with this one - the bats could blow in off the mainland and evolve, but other mammals couldn't do that. I admit it, I don't have an answer, except maybe God's testing our faith again. But I can see not everyone will like that. I'm still wondering about those bats! Okay Mr. Darwin, I said it already but I'll say it again, you were a smart guy. So how's life at MIT? And I hope you read the book I recommended to you. A Canticle for Leibowitz will show you that faith and science have more in common than you might think!Take care,Bob"

This:""This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful not injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic.""We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change, and some species might become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would most seriously affect many of the others. If the country were open on its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. Let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up, if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area been open immigration, these same places would have been seized on by intruders. In such case, ever slight modification, which in the course of ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of improvement. ""We have reason to believe, as stated in the first chapter, that a change in the conditions of life, by specially acting on the reproductive systems, cause or increases variability; and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a changes, and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by giving a better chance of profitable variations occurring; and unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing.""

I'm surprised at how adapted we have become (or at least the segment of those people on the planet who don't reject Darwin's theory of natural selection as counter to their own idea of the way God makes and shakes) to Darwin's revolutionary idea(s). Like with many of the pantheon of scientific geniuses (Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, etc) there was a bit of random chance involved. The ground was ready for Darwin's adapted seed. There were enough scholars and scientists and rationalists around to carry his idea(s) hither and his theory thither. So while this book, and Darwin himself, were both stellar examples of scientific restraint, the force and momentum of OftS can't be under appreciated. It was just the right time and right place for a scientific revolution. Darwin and his little book walked by a labour of scientific mouldywarps who happened to find themselves on the chalk cliffs of science, pushed those sterile hybrids off, and never looked back. Evolve bitches!"

You can't review a historic artefact.This is a fantastic read, even viewed in a completely different way to how it would have been read at the time. It really is amazing how much evolutionary biology Darwin was able to formulate almost a century before Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA. It boggles the mind what Darwin could have been capable of if he'd had access to the last 150 years of genetic research."

If I were lost in an uncivilized world and had only two books, I would want a Webster's dictionary and this Origin of Species. The dictionary to learn word definitions and this book to learn about the flora and fauna around me.

158,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"Too much to unpack here and not an easy read as it was written 150 years ago. Despite all of the knocks against reading Origin for enjoyment, I can only express extreme awe and state the obvious - how much of a genius Darwin was. From his theory of natural selection to glacier theory, to hybrid plants, to fossil theory and a dozen other biological and geological theories that he developed or contributed to, it is remarkable to me how very little Darwin got wrong in a book that was 600 pages long. We live in a science based world, or at least we like to think so, and this man manages to remain so relevant. It is the scientific method at its best, one part rigorous logic, one part observation, and one part intuition. The recipe works."
159,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,4,"Decry or applaud it, there's no question this work has had a profound effect not just on science, but the culture at large. What I wouldn't read this book for is the science, or in an effort to either defend or refute the argument for evolution. The core of Darwin's argument certainly is still what was taught in my Catholic high school biology class (taught by a nun). In a nutshell, the theory is that given there are wide-ranging subtle Variations among organisms, the Malthusian Struggle for Existence causes by means of Natural Selection of the inheritable traits that are the best Adaptations to the environment the Origin of Species or as Darwin calls it, the ""theory of descent with modification.""But, after all, this book is now over 150 years old. Science is about explaining natural phenomenon and correcting mistakes through observation, experimentation and falsification--not dogma--and so is always a moving target. I know that. But I still raised an eyebrow when in the first chapter of the book Darwin said he believed the ""most frequent cause of variability"" was caused by the experiences of the parents before conception--such as cows' udders being larger in countries where they're milked because the habit of milking by itself alters in the reproductive organs what is inherited by the next generation. WTF Darwin? When Darwin first propounded his theory of evolution (a word never used in the book by the way) through natural selection, Mendel had yet to discover the basic principles of genetics in his experiments with peas and Watson and Crick had yet to unravel the structure of DNA. Nor was continental drift known and understood, so there were notable gaps in Darwin's reasoning that has since been filled. Stephen Jay Gould, one of the staunchest defenders and popularizers of evolution is famous within science particularly for where he differs from Darwin. Darwin thought changes in species were very gradual. Gould favors ""punctuated equilibrium"" where there are rapid changes followed by long periods of stability. That's why scientists today talk of the ""theory of evolution,"" not of ""Darwinism"" as if a scientific principle is an unchanging creed and Origin of Species scripture.So, the book is dated and filled with lots of details I'm sure are just plain wrong and might be onerous to unlearn. That does make me reluctant to give this book top marks despite its profound impact. Someone interested in modern evolutionary science would be better off picking up a copy of a book by Jared Diamond, Richard Dawkins, Carl Sagan (although by now I suppose his very readable Dragons of Eden is dated) or Stephen Jay Gould. So, was there no value in reading On the Origin of Species? I wouldn't say that. It's surprisingly readable--or at least understandable. There are definitely dry passages that were a slog to get through, my eyes glazing over as Darwin gave example after exhaustive example to make his points. However, I couldn't help but be impressed by the knowledge of nature shown by his wide-ranging examples from every continent from ants and bees and algae to pigeons to zebras. Given the way he cited various authorities and spoke about his own experiments, I definitely felt that here was a master generalist and enthusiast on nature. Moreover Darwin does have a gift for metaphor and illustrative examples. I was particularly taken by his explanation of ""inter-crossing"" and the function of sex in creating biological diversity. I also was struck by how cautious and civil in tone Darwin is in his arguments, devoting an entire chapter on what he saw could be the flaws and holes in his theory--particularly the issues of transitions between species and intermediate forms. Bottom line? Arguably this specific book had as much influence on the literature and politics of the next century as Freud or Marx, so I think there is historical value in reading this, preferably in the first edition (which is what I read) that exploded upon the world in 1859."

""If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from feeling the benefit of this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third stage.""
On the Origin of Species is one of the most important books ever written. Although a lot of people-scientists, naturalists and the like-were coming to the same kind of conclusions, Darwin was one of the first who wrote it all down in a profound and concise manner and used his influence and friends to make it a well-known theory: the theory of evolution.There is only one thing you need to know before you read this, and that is that Charles Darwin was a very religious man. This is a five-star worthy book, but my ignorance of this fact caused me to be so infuriated by the end that I couldn't bring myself to rate it higher. It is written exquisitely: if you've read anything particularly science-related in this day and age you will notice how science-related it is. The words, the terms, they're all very much science-related and it can be so difficult to really understand and comprehend what you're reading because it's almost in another language.This is written very much in the way any Victorian novel would have been written. There is a smattering of Latin terms, but for the most part it is easy to understand if you get in the right frame of mind as you would a Classic. It can be heavy going, however, as the paragraphs are long and often repetitive, but his thoughts on pigeons are the most endearing things I've come across: this is Victorian science and it's all about pigeons.To go back to why I only rated it three stars: throughout at no point did Darwin mention God or the creation of the world, except perhaps in very subtle reference and the theory of evolution and instinct reigns supreme, until the very end when he concludes that God did not create the world 1859 years, but millions of years ago, instead, and that all current flora and fauna are descended from the original God-created animals. I should have expected something like this but I did not and that annoyed me more than it should have. Of course, it makes the entire thing that much more impressive, though the horrific experience Darwin must have gone through as he tried to make a religious-belief co-live with a scientific frame of mind would have been supremely agonising. It's wholly my fault for this ignorance, but I still can't bring myself to heighten it.It's still one of the most important books ever written and its legacy will never become diminished, but it is often repetitive and sometimes out-dated with quite a lengthy part about geology which is fairly unremarkable, but his amusing and enjoyable experiments with flowers and his views on pigeons are just a delight.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy"
161,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"My book group selected this book for discussion probably because of the historic impact it has had on the field of science. However, I found it to be very worthy of respect from a literary viewpoint. Charles Darwin's writing comes across as a methodical thinker and patient explainer to many recalcitrant readers who are determined not to believe a word he says. He had me convinced after only a couple dozen pages, but he kept doing what seemed to me to be piling on observation after observation, explanation after explanation, until after a while I felt like crying out, ""Enough already, I believe!"" Frankly, I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge about the natural world already accumulated by the middle of the 19th century as demonstrated by this book. There are obvious things poor old Darwin didn't know about, one of them being the laws of genealogy discovered by Gregor Johann Mendel. Mendel was a contemporary of Darwin, and I have heard that a published copy of Mendel's study was on Darwin's book shelves but it hadn't been opened or read. Of course Darwin wasn't the only person who ignored Mendel. Mendel's work wasn't appreciated for its contribution to understanding of inherited traits until after his death. Meanwhile Darwin is writing this book giving many observations regarding the variability of crossings of various plants and animals, but doesn't understand why.Also, Darwin was plagued with physicists of the time who calculated that earth couldn't be as old as needed for Darwin's theory of natural selection to accomplish all the required changes. The physicists were basing their calculations of the rate cooling of the core of the earth. Of course they were wrong; what they didn't know about was radioactive decay which gives off heat they weren't making allowances for. It turns out the earth is even older than Darwin would have guessed.And of course the really big advance of science that Darwin didn't know about was the DNA double helix. Darwin insists that life forms need to be classed according to genealogy, and he speculates that in the future scientists will be able to classify life forms more accurately as more knowledge is obtained about them. Darwin would be amazed to know how precisely genealogy can be determined these days. For example, it can be determined that humans are more closely related to fungi than to photosynthetic plants.I listened to the audio version of this book. This is an example of a book that is much easier to listen to than to read because of all the big Latin words used in describing species. Having the words read aloud made them fit into the context of the sentence much better than if I were trying to read (and probably skip over) those unfamiliar words. There were six editions of ""Origin of Species"" in Darwin's life time. It could be argued that the 1859 edition is the second best version of this book with the 1860 British edition being slightly better in that it contains some insignificant, but non-substantive, corrections. The editions of 1861, 1866, 1869, and 1872 are all inferior. In them Darwin made changes and expansions in an effort to meet the objections that arose during those times. The modifications expanded the book and clouded the argument. Since most of the objections that were raised would be regarded as silly today, Darwin's arguments against them are of interest for social history, but not for Darwin's theory. I think that most published copies today are based on the 1872 edition. If you have an earlier edition you will find that it is shorter and, as indicated above, is probably better.The following quotation is from the sixth edition and not in the earlier editions. It is from a section of the book on instincts and follows a couple paragraphs discussing the habit of some birds to lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species. Mr. Darwin has just sighted some of the observations of the nesting habits of a type of cowbird [Molothrus Bonariensis] written by a naturalist colleague. ""Mr. Hudson is a strong disbeliever in evolution, but he appears to have been much struck by the imperfect instincts of the Molothrus Bonariensis that he quotes my words and asks, 'must we consider these habits not as an especially endowed or created instincts but as small consequences of one general law, namely transitions?' ""I take from the above that Darwin was enjoying the irony of a naturalist from the creationist camp finding it difficult to attribute to God the endowment of the slothful nest making habits to the cowbird. Since the behavior is repugnant it must have been caused by that old nasty evolution stuff (i.e. the work of the devil)."

Or, perhaps you are a student participating in one of nation's modern and progressive science classes, learning about the Origins of Man, but confused by the lack of scientifically observable studies missing from your text books.

163,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48327873-markus,5,"On The Origin of SpeciesDarwin (1809-1882)Darwin published this book in 1859. It is his scientific treaty based on the idea of all organism living on the earth to be descendants from one or several original progenitors.The work is mostly a transcription of the author’s notes throughout his years of study and his famous voyage on the HMS Beagle to the Southern Hemisphere. It had likely been addressed to the quite sceptic scientific community of his time, to demonstrate his idea and to bring supporting material enough to convince and to proof its validity. Apart from the excessively rich scientific vocabulary, the book is pleasant reading. A few quotations will give some insight: ""This Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements, and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence into my accuracy. No doubt errors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone. In considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryonic relations, their geographical distribution, geological successions, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties from other species.”The work is developed in chapters:Variations under Domestications,Variations in Nature,Struggle for existence,Natural selection; or Survival of the fittest,Laws of variation,Difficulties of the theory, Miscellaneous objections to the theory of Natural Selection,Instinct,Hybridism,On the imperfection of the Geological Record,On the Geological Succession of Organic Beings Geographical distribution,Mutual affinities of organic beings, Embryology,Quotations from Recapitulation and Conclusion: ""I see no good reason why the view given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of anyone. It could be just as noble a conception for a Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws. The belief that species were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was believed to be of short duration; and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are apt to assume, that the geological record would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species. Now, things are wholly changed, and almost every naturalist admits the great principle of evolution, over the old belief in the creation of species from the dust of the earth. The laws of Nature, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to the struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural selection, and the Extinction of less-improved forms. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one.”I have much enjoyed reading this book and am glad not to have missed it. I recommend it to anyone interested in Natural History or just in knowledge as such."

At times, it was hard getting through this book, mainly because it's dense and sometimes Darwin tended to drag and not get to the point, but I'm glad I finally read it. However, I think I should have read this at another point of my life - I mean, it was exasperating to read something I had just studied at a biology course I was taking. I still don't regret reading this. If you're considering on whether picking this book or not (yeah, I'm actually recommending it), I suggest you do it between your leisure reading because it can get tedious if you swallow it all at once."

166,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/210123-d-g,5,"My science education left a lot to be desired. I was never taught the Theory of Natural Selection in school but only heard it mentioned when some adults scoffed at it. Thankfully, my natural talents steered me away from a career in Biology or Genetics, so this lack of knowledge didn’t affect my career prospects. It just affected my understanding of the world. I learned years later the basics of the theory but this just piqued my interest about reading the actual book. I always have problems with Victorian authors (very long sentences) so the print version gave me some difficulty. If it weren’t for Richard Dawkins' excellent narration, I don’t know that I could have enjoyed this book as much.I’m almost shocked that I was able to follow the concepts herein as well as I did. I am amazed that Mr. Darwin could write this book (one of the most important in the history of science and the whole world) in such clear, concise way, that a person with minimal understanding of the topic in general could follow along so well. The concepts are explained logically with tons of examples so the reader is not left dangling wondering what he meant. Not only that, but he also writes beautifully and the prose is sometimes as poetic as it is instructive:As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.From the beginning, I understood this wasn’t a book I could listen in one sitting or while doing other things. I took it slowly and that allowed me to think things through. It made me think a lot about our place in the world and how sometimes we think we are above the system when in fact, we are just one creature among millions and not the most important in the grand scheme of nature (if we were to go extinct, the planet will continue merrily along.) It made reflect in our attempts to control nature, to see change as a bad thing, and our hubris that we can keep in check a process that has moved relentlessly forward for millions of years.Darwin was certainly cognizant that his theory wouldn’t be accepted immediately: “Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory.”  But I think he would be surprised by how much discussion there is still going on about the subject, specially given that DNA evidence has already proven he was correct in thinking that every living being sprouted from a single progenitor (mind staggering as it seems.)As I already mentioned, Richard Dawkins is the narrator for this audiobook and he did an amazing job - you could tell he's probably read this book a million times and knows it like the back of his hand. His diction was very precise and clear; and his enthusiasm for the subject was contagious. It almost feels like Darwin is the one speaking. Overall, a must read for anybody with an interest in learning how we came into being. "

Not because it’s poorly written, archaically worded, or just a boring topic- all untrue- but because the ideas were so influential that the entire book is just one big “duh, yeah, I’m already on board with this, you don’t need to harp on so much, I see what you’re getting at and I agree it makes sense.” (I remember a similar feeling with Singer’s Animal Liberation, for example.)  This is obviously one of those books. If you’ve got a high school diploma, you already understand natural selection, and if you’re interested in biology at all, you probably also understand the evidentiary support/finer tunings of the theory.  Essentially this is like, 700 pages of Darwin giving evidence for his theory by listing out different animals or plants and discussing how the variations imply a common ancestor/his theory and how they disprove his opponents’ arguments. Pigeons with X number of tail feathers, horses with leg stripes, radishes versus rutabagas. Lots and lots and lots of details about things like this.  I’m glad I read it because Darwin is clearly anxious nobody will believe his wild new theory, since he throws so much evidence at the reader. This serves, to me, as a fantastic reminder that this was, in fact, a radical kooky theory at the time and nothing in science should be taken for granted as truth because there is always, always always, a shakeup on the horizon that will make us question everything. And no era is immune to that- every era has thought itself “finally at the truth” and every time we’ve been wrong. As we are now, in ways we can’t even imagine yet."
168,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29868756-katie-bananas,5,"Celebratory 2:00 am review, just great!!! When I finished this, I was definitely clapping my hands!! This is not a story if you are one of those who are mad excited to read it. It's a tome of its size that is equivalent to an encyclopedia with depth, width, and value. It's the densest nonfiction I have read. It is an attempt to read a genre I really wasn't familiar with. Since I got into reading, I believe that nonfiction is one of the genres that is most daunting to me. In 2016, I definitely attempted a few; yet, I never really expected to grab this one off the shelves like that and just read it. It has an encyclopedia feel and it definitely reads like one as well. Charles Darwin is quite the familiar science genius known to students studying biology everywhere. He along with Mendel, the father of genetics, are the monsters for biology making it seemingly hard. As I mentioned above it's not a story, and it's not a simple read or a book for enjoyment. It is also not a list of drone. It's a rather valuable read of its size with historical touches and very good research on animals and all their genres with density and heaviness. The theory of natural selection as studied in class is not well explained by mere professors. I bet these clowns never came to attempt reading this. I'm repeating it's not a novel and a story you read for leisure time. Professors want to finish curricula, and that's why that's the part that's rushed at the end. I dreaded the study of kingdoms and phyla and Darwinism, because it was never properly explained.After reading this, I think my self respect and self esteem both grew at sheer, personal will while experiencing this book. Before reading, my imagination was always centered around the fact that this book is boring and I'll never find it on ebook. Now, I come to say that I was really thankful to my library for providing it online. Natural selection as emphasized, is the pure fact that all animals are picked out in accordance of their strengths and most intricate and distinguishable characteristics to build the up and coming generations. With this critical focus and specific selection comes variability. Variability is the guy who screams so loud, that for instance, a rose and an orchid are not the same, even though they are both very well known beautiful flowers to the sight of our eyes. Different species of dogs and bees evolve to not be the same. Each animal evolves to have their varied kinds and characteristics. I think of it as myself reading a book and loving it at the end. Did I necessarily love each page? Not necessarily, which presents myself as selective; however, I may have liked the book for its content or flow of a story, even though I didn't like a character or two, or even three. This book is my dense pride of 2016. It will mark my last nonfiction of the year, not because I had enough and finished a book; but rather, because of its mere volume, density, and pure heaviness. I intentionally took long breaks to go back and think what I learned, it really was a ton of material!!! This doesn't make it a textbook. It's an awesome encyclopedia full of potential with long lists of animals who were very well researched down to the hairs on their skin to state their merest and very specified difference, as to say: ""We are both redheads, but you specifically have this characteristic pimple or bump, which makes you slightly different"". Natural selection is a dense concept to attain and learn, because of how variability in the varieties are sincerely observed. I had mentioned that I skipped a whole chapter, which I ended up reading at the very end. It was the chapter on the objections against the theory. I was wondering why is this in the middle of the book, rather than at the end? I skipped it at first to first learn about the theory and various research along with all the researchers who helped Darwin writing this book with insights on their research. Objections, I thought came later. The reason why they came in the middle, I later on discovered is for the fact that these particular objections were not covering the whole book, but rather the first few chapters.It was very good, very dense, and a very important scientific classic. It needs a good amount of patience and belief in your progress. I have a different appreciation for animals and plants knowing that the best of its kind supplant all the others, making it really significant and absolutely striking. Seriously? Yes, absolute genius of a volume!! :)"
169,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1496261-cora-judd,5,"Richard Dawkins' narration of this book is excellent -- I enjoyed it immensely, however, without my semester of physical anthropology, the essential points would have required much more mental attention. Dawkins inserts clarifying information throughout the book and while Darwin's writing is wonderfully clear, I think more of Dawkins' notes and updates would have been an enhancement.I was surprised to see how diverse Darwin's background research was and how elegantly he wrote. He anticipated counter-arguments to his ideas and cleanly, systematically eliminated them. As he concluded each level of his argument, the gaps in his knowledge (due to gaps in scientific progress at the time of his being published) required that he make certain logical leaps and assumptions. These were especially interesting because he was invariably correct, as time has shown.Dawkins abridged the book to some degree which makes me leary - I want to know what the author intended the reader to know. And because the subject is still (astoundingly) controversial, abridging anything of this nature will likely invite criticism."
170,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2345961-pollopicu,2,"What in the world made me want to read this Goliath of a science book? My goodness! I guess if I had to search deep within myself I would have to say I wanted to read anything Darwin, just to see what all the fuss was about, but mostly because of the reviews I read on Goodreads. I thought The Origin of Species would turn me into the science-loving person I always thought lurked inside me.The main reason I finished it is because any science book that has had this much publicity deserves to be read and finished.First of all, it contained a considerable amount of text for a study which was only suppose to be a treatise. This book wasn't difficult to read, as many would have you think. It's not. In fact, it's pretty straight forward. But are you interested in reading 700 pages of things having to do with birds, aquatic mammals, cattle, beaks, gills, bills, plumage, fauna, fowl, pollen, eggs, and embryos? Don't get me wrong, I'm as interested to hear where we might have originated from as much as the next person, but if you take the book at face value, who would be interested in reading page after page of detailed observations of animals most of us will live a lifetime without even having encountered and if we do, so what. I say that as a lover of nature. I mean a LOVER of all things outdoors that have to do with looking at stuff, not reading about it. Where I live we often see herons, and gorgeous owls, foxes, snakes, etc, but I don't want to read 700 pages about them. I want to admire them for a while, but then keep it moving.From what I gathered, it seems to me that scientists and naturalists can't even agree on the differences between species and varieties to begin with. A lot of these studies aren't even conclusive, which makes a lot of sense now since it's a book on the THEORY of evolution. I didn't stop to think of the literal definition of the word ""theory"". Had I paused for a moment to give it thought, I would've realized I would be committing weeks to a treatise that is basically speculation. To me that's a huge waste of time when there are so many other books out there to read. Give me history or give me straight up fiction by topics on theory seem pointless to me. Also, the idea that Darwin's theory of evolution was indirectly responsible for the genocide of so many people during the Nazi era is simply horrific. I had no clue when I began reading this book that Hitler was a follower of Darwin's theory, taking it to heart (a bit too much) the supposed superiority of the white race, hence, making all other races inferior, and therefore extinguishing them. The Subtitle of The Species of Origin was suppose to be “The Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life.” Darwin referred to inferior races as ""savages"", and by savages he meant people with darker skin, such as Native Americans and Africans. Darwin, being the prolific and respected scientist he was, influenced many people (through his work) to practice prejudice, racism and oppression. Hitler believed that the human gene pool could be improved by selective breeding, very much like that of cattle in farm breeding, thus protecting the ""superior"" race. This is simply horrifying.In the end I'm glad I read this book, although I hated the actual reading part. Not so much because of what it contains, but because of the role it has played in our history, of which I was clueless about. In the frustration of reading this book, I made the effort to dig for more information about why so many modern day people are still fascinated by it, still not sure, but I did learn a lot from it, and it did inspire me to dig deep into other genocides that have been committed around the world in which this book may or may not have been indirectly responsible for. However, the book was absolutely tedious. It's like reading about a subject you absolutely loath, like sports, or construction. The part of the book that actually cracked me up was chapter XII (Geographical Distribution) because after having read what seemed like 200 pages of that, the next chapter (XIII) was called ""Geographical Distribution continued"", lol. At that point I was delirious and might have lost it. It's very rare for me to purposely not recommend reading what people consider a ""required read"", but this was a tough one. If you want to read it to add it to your library, go ahead, but I'm giving you fair warning, it's laborious like nothing you've ever read. You will have to see for yourself. "
171,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen,3,"3.0 to 3.5 stars. Not anything like what I would call a ""fun"" read, but I am really happy that I finally read this book given the tremendous influence it has had on the history on modern scientific thinking. The book itself, while dry, is fairly accessible and is not bogged down with overly complex scientific jargon. I would read a couple of chapters a day in between my ""pleasure"" reading and it made the book much easier to absorb. Definitely worth reading. "

And we should be proud that we are the only species that has figured out how we came to be."" ~Jerry A. Coyne, Ph.D., University of ChicagoOn the Origin of Species is Darwin laying out his theory of natural selection in precise, laborious detail. He knew quite well many of the objections and arguments this supposition would invoke, and he counters every anticipated antagonism with a barrage of evidence gained from detailed observation and/or astute experimentation. The idea that plant and animal species evolved from common ancestry was an affront to 1859 sensibilities and the courage required to challenge widespread, ingrained superstition and misinformation must have been enormous. And yet, here it is. The imperfect but substantial cornerstone of biology, biochemistry, psychology, genetics, anthropology, neurology, primatology, embryology... the list is immense.

If only people read this by themselves!It was fascinating how the ""missing links"" was explained by Darwin in a context of geology. Most importantly he was indicating towards Tectonics (that was brought into light many years after darwin's time by Alfred Wegener). Clearly, Darwin was way ahead of his contemporaries. I knew it took him years to publish his work (arguably, partially because of psychosomatic dissonance), but the intense work on gathering information and years of research bolsters his point. He indeed wanted to be very sure of the theory. I am amazed by darwin's thought process that seems very instinctive to anyone who grew up studying about evolution ... however, being the forerunner in joining the dots on the same is very nonintuitive which marks his brilliance. Highly recommended to the Creationists. "

175,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"It took me awhile to drag myself into reading this one. People have always commented that it was so dull and that it was convoluted and hard to follow and I have always believed in evolution and found modern books very accessible on the subject so I thought why bother? Then again I have a thing for classics, and as my list of books on evolution grew I started to chide myself that I still had not even read from Darwin's own hand. So I bent to the grain and pulled it out. This book was nothing like what I expected. Absolutely NOTHING like what I expected. If you read this with an open mind, slowly and take each of his points into consideration you find an absolute flawless logic to his argument. It is well presented and actually I find that compared to many scientific articles it is clearly written for the wider audience. Darwin wants you to get it. He wrote as plainly and carefully as he could. He did not propose his idea half assed or hurriedly. I was floored to find that all of my favorite arguments for evolution came straight from the horses mouth as it were. Darwin got it. He really really got it. He went at it from every angle he could, geological time scales, fossils, birds, plants, animals, interactions, sexual selection, selection on islands, selection in various terrains. He broke it down bit by bit and said: Look guys, I hardly wanted to buy this myself but this is how it is. Just look! See for yourself. Make up your own mind. His methodical manner is hard to shy away from. He did not come up with an idea and let others run with it. He did the research, he talked to people, he took it from all angles and presented it in the clearest manner possible. Yes I have to admit that the writing was a bit dry, but the river of content was overflowing, and the proposal was elegant and clear. What a wonderful contribution. I am honored to have read this work and chide myself yet again for my hesitation. "
176,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22315959-morgan,1,"I can now truly say that, having read the Origin of Species, I find the theory of evolution to be complete and utter hogwash. Darwin never truly gives an explanation for how microevolution can realistically extrapolated into macroevolution. Also, when he brings up objections against his theory, he gives an elaborate excuse for why he cannot prove his point rather than proving it. I am still a firm believer in Creation. It is a lot more logical than evolution."

178,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6051061-t-d-whittle,5,"I know the world has not been waiting with bated breath for 160 years to hear my opinion of this marvelous book, but I wanted to add my praise anyway. This is such a beautiful read. Darwin makes his argument for descent through modification of all organic life with such patience, eloquence, and clarity that it's awe inspiring, especially when one bears in mind that DNA and its sure-fire evidence of descent had not been discovered yet. It's truly remarkable that Darwin was right about almost every detail, using only the tools he had to work with in the nineteenth century, his formidable intelligence, and his sparkling intuition. I understand completely now why he is considered one of the few dozen greatest minds of all time, since recorded history.Darwin writes like a dream. He is gracious to and appreciative of his fellow naturalists. He's honest about the limits of what could be known with certainty, and what could be only guessed at. This style of writing in science is a breath of fresh air from a bygone era. I found Darwin's exuberance regarding his subject contagious, and am including a some of my favourite passages below, so that I can remember them.One thing that made the reading a bit tricky is that I do not speak Latin and, even if I did, would not necessarily know the names of plants and animals by their scientific labels; thus, I did not even recognise the names of common animals in my own country: the kangaroo and the platypus! Given that this book was written for Darwin's contemporaries who were laypersons, I wonder how they would have known these names, or if they read Darwin whilst having editions of botanical and zoological binomial nomenclature nearby? I had Google, of course, but found it also helpful to keep charts of geological eras at hand, an excellent globe, and maps of the world reflecting things as they were at the time of Darwin's writing. ""It is a truly wonderful fact—the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity—that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group, in the manner which we everywhere behold—namely, varieties of the same species most closely related together, species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together, forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct genera much less closely related, and genera related in different degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and classes. "" (pps. 170-171)""All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together or separating objects more or less alike.But I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe the arrangement of the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to the other groups, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but that the amount of difference in the several branches or groups, though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which they have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera, families, sections, or orders."" (p. 404)""As all organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived on this earth have to be classed together, and as all have been connected by the finest gradations, the best, or indeed, if our collections were nearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical. Descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the natural system."" (p. 427)""On the view of each organic being and each separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable it is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we wilfully will not understand."" (p. 452)""But the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate steps. The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been formed, and great valleys excavated, by the slow action of the coast-waves., The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations, accumulated during and almost infinite number of generations."" (p.453)On the imperfection of the geological record: ""The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record. The crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made at hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on and unusual concurrence of circumstances, and the blank intervals between the sucdessive stages as having been of vast duration. But we shall be able to gauget with some security the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeeding organic forms. ... "" (p. 457)This passage is so eloquent, and yet I do not believe mankind, at least, has continued to evolve towards perfection. So sadly optimistic: ""Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction fo the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual. When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the past, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity. And of the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species of each genus, and all the species of many genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. We can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to fortell that it will be the common and widely-spread species, belonging to the larger and dominant groups, which will ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Silurian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection."" (p. 459)""Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."" (p. 460)"
179,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1528196-joe,3,"Having finished Origin, I am taking the liberty of adding a few comments at the top of what I posted when I first added it to my ""currently-reading shelf."" To the would-be classics reader who is a bit daunted at the notion of tackling a fourteen chapter science book written in 19th Century technical terms I offer the suggestion that the back half of Origin is purely optional and can be let go. The first six chapters are the most enjoyable. Four is the big one, where Darwin presents the big pitch, with One through Three being the wind-up to prep the audience. Six is fairly unusual in science literature, being an effort to admit problems with the theory and making efforts to address them. Chapter Seven, on instinct, is aumsing but not vital to the core of the work if your attention is already starting to wander. The rest that follow involve technical arguments that may be pointless to most modern readers. To follow why Darwin makes them one would have to conversant in the state of the art in zoology, botany and geology as it was 150 years ago. I skipped much of it.A few points readers with only a casual knowledge of science may take from this book- Evolution predates Darwin, whose contribution is actually the mechanism of natural selection which explains how it works. He also contributed another mechanism, sexual selection, for traits inherited for their value in obtaining mates. Darwin offers an unexpected chuckle in a quote from Aristotle which suggestive of an understanding of something very much like natural selection.>What follows is old commentary.I am reading this one for the historical value, not the science. A big joke is that people of a certain outlook do try to read it for the science so they can refute it. Silly. Origin is as about as state of the art on evolution science as Newton is on 21st Century string theory. Ah, well.What I have found interesting so far is the struggle Darwin goes through to make his argument in the absence of the kind of modern scientific language or terminology that would have made things simple and clear to his readers. Even more interesting is that Darwin had no clue as to the mechanics of inheritance and admitted as much (the discovery of DNA was a long way off in the future), and yet was able to work out so much on his own without that knowledge.Cool factoid: Darwin took his time pondering his theories for many years before suddenly rushing to get them into print. It seems that while he was taking his time another naturalist named Wallace worked out natural selection too...and then wrote to Darwin for help in placing his findings in front of the right experts! You know how the science establishment is about giving credit to the first one to publish and forgetting the also-rans who came to the same conclusions just a tad too late. One party gets into the textbooks of future generations, while the other is lucky to become a footnote.I'll post some stars when I'm done reading."
180,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"So this is the foundation of the theory of evolution. No, Darwin was not the first or only one with musings much like the ones described in this book, but he took some other people's theories (incl. that of his own grandfather) and took them further or perfected them.After having spent 5 years on the Beagle and thus seeing all kinds of places, Darwin had returned to England. It would be many years before he published this book but during the last stretch of the journey, Darwin had discovered something along some of the specimen he had collected on the Galápagos Islands. No, it was not his famous finches. Those he had forgotten (or not known) to label, thus no longer knowing which bird came from which of the islands. It was also not the famous tortoises as every single one of the ones taken on board the Beagle had been eaten and the shell been thrown overboard.Luckily, there were still the mockingbirds. And like all animals on the Galápagos, they too were different on every island and he HAD labelled them.Thus, he saw that while they were all mockingbirds, they had slight differences, especially when it came to their beaks, which gave him the idea of them being specialized to the life conditions on their respective island.It was also the Galápagos Islands that gave him the idea of volcanic activity birthing an island. He just didn't know about plate tectonics yet, sadly, as that theory was only established (and proven) about 100 years later.Thus, he talks of evolution as nature's way of selecting traits most suited for whatever life a creature lives. He talks about sexual selection and extinction of animals.Think back to those times: mankind thought themselves the master of the Earth, as God had willed it. God, the omnipotent being, had created all things. Evolution, therefore, was blasphemy as it meant God either at least changing his mind or having made mistakes. You can imagine how some people reacted once this book had been written and published.However, while reading this book, I was delighted to see that Darwin never bashed religious people but simply didn't talk about religion at all. Maybe he had learned not to broach the subject since he was married to a Catholic. *lol* Instead, he simply laid out his theory and his reasons for having established it, giving ample proof while listing the single steps. And whenever there was a gap, he would address it and explain why it was there, what the likely answer was and, again, why.I was astonished and more than pleased to see how he had written this book. Much like in his journal about the voyage on the Beagle, he shows a beautiful writing style and wrote this book not only for scholars but - and this was radical as well - for the layman to understand. A complex and new concept explained in a simple way to make the science accessible.Like when he talked about humans breeding dogs to be of a certain size and character traits or gardeners crossing different flowers to get certain petal shapes and colours.He took Humboldt's ""web of life"" and transformed it into his famous ""tree of life"". There were a few minor errors (we know now) but all in all, his logic was sound - only limited, sometimes, by some thing or other that hadn't yet been discovered or explained. My hardcover edition had beautiful illustrations. Some were Darwin's sketches, other were oil paintings of animals he was talking about in the book. However, much like with the other book, there is an audio version narrated by Dawkins that is really very good despite being abridged.Where humankind would be without Darwin and this book, I do not know. We owe Darwin and his work a lot, though, that's for sure."

182,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477945-kendall,5,"Finally re-read after decades of good intentions. For a recondite classic it is full of surprises, mostly pleasant; its supposed impenetrability largely confined to parts we already knew were directed at specialists—I admit to slogging through the section on barnacles, for example. But Origins is highly readable, pleasurable even, almost in the way of an Edmund Wilson essay. Darwin proceeds deliberately through the mountain of evidence he collected over twenty years as he constructs a virtually unassailable intellectual structure. Freely recognizing arguments against natural selection—the central thread of the book—he gives his best arguments based on the knowledge of his day while carefully pointing out its limitations. I was not prepared for how well he anticipated later discoveries—Mendel’s pioneering work in genetics didn’t see publication until the early 20th century yet dovetails almost seamlessly into Origins exposition, as does the Modern Synthesis. If you’re interested in any of the broad fields of biology-evolution, taxonomy, genetics—The Origin of Species is a must read. If you are a creationist, even in its deceptive guise of intelligent design, you are not intellectually honest if you have not read and honestly come to grips with this book; which gives the lie to the railings of a few misguided Christians and Muslims who seem to think it a product of their devil. Yet, so thoughtful and measured a book makes it clear any devils are in the eye of the beholder. "
183,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,4,"In reading The Origin of Species, one of the things I found myself respecting most about Charles Darwin was his aversion to dogma, religious or otherwise. He was generally logical, reasonable, and slow to jump to conclusions, and it seems to me that the enduring quality of this book owes much to these traits in its author. 
""From these and similar considerations, but chiefly from our ignorance of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United States; and from the revolution in our palæontological ideas on many points, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected, it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of organic beings throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its productions.""

184,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13229843-ben-batchelder,1,"Charles Darwin’s “The Origin of Species” promises a lot. A back cover blurb says, “Next to the Bible no work has been quite as influential....” I’m not a scientist, but with a build up like that I had to give it a try after enjoying “The Voyage of the Beagle” (reviewed 9/5/13).It is a slog of a read, yet Darwin’s enthusiasm for his subject, the excitement he conveys in outlining the work of his lifetime and popularizing a scientific movement, are palpable. Ironically, Darwin was not a scientist himself, but a “naturalist,” whose first job in the field – to be the Beagle’s naturalist-on-board – was a bit of a lark, suggested by friends, after his prior path to becoming an Anglican pastor (his father’s preference) came to naught.His insights – not entirely original, as he really consolidated lines of thinking going on for several generations – stemmed not only from his visit to the Galapagos Islands on the Beagle, but from observing man-driven selection in the breeding of domesticated animals.  I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man’s power of selection. But the expression...Survival of the Fittest is more accurate...” (p.61) Yet the problems start right away. As Creationist Kent Hovind has pointed out, the assumption that natural selection causes evolution is problematic, for “natural selection” never creates, it only selects. Furthermore, “survival of the fittest” is a tautology, for by definition the fit survive and the survivors are fit. As Hovind points out, natural selection might be more clearly called differential reproduction, that is, some reproduce more than others.And what drove Darwin to this line of thinking? It turns out he was a Malthusian, the Chicken Little of his time:It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them. (p. 63) The implication being, for some to live, others must die. Death, then, turns out to be the selection method of the Universe, in the never-ending struggle to survive. Or, as he succinctly states, “Thus, extinction and natural selection go hand in hand.” (p.161)Sensing how grim his outlook might appear, Darwin tries to pre-empt: When we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply. (p.75) Call it the theory of Happy Death then, one of many assertions that don’t ring true. No fear is felt? Death is generally prompt? Well, then, bring on more of this necessary (per Malthus) and creative force!Elevating nature to a Capitalized Power, Darwin characterizes it as less selfish than we: “Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends.” (p.79)Around this part of the book came the first of many mentions (that I noticed) of the phrase “scale of nature,” which of course is a direct descendent of Plato’s and Aristotle’s Scala Naturae, showing a direct link to the pagan concept of a hierarchy of development that was transformed into the the Great Chain of Being by the Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century. This pagan belief in a hierarcy of more and less developed beings may have influenced Darwin’s unfortunate choice of sub-title: “By Means of Natural Selection of the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.” It is difficult to find a modern edition of the book that hasn’t scrubbed clean this evidence of Darwin’s easy racism. (Only in my 150th Anniversary Edition, from Signet Classics in 2003, could I find the sub-title in any edition on-line – tucked away in a title page inside.) One can see why Darwin’s boosters try to re-write history, for the sub-title’s “favoured races” helps explain how Social Darwinism – only disavowed by evolution’s supporters after the horrors of WWII – created so much havoc in the 20th century. (Marx and Stalin were nominally Christian before reading Darwin; both Stalin and Hitler appropriated Darwin for their perverted, murderous philosophies.)In terms of other influences, Darwin often refers to Charles Lyell and his (literally) ground-breaking “Principles of Geology” which, by positing long geological ages, gave breathing room for Darwin’s theory of numerous “slight variations” to evolve, of minuscule improvements multiplied over unimaginably many iterations. He goes so far as to warn skeptical readers:	He who can read Sir Charles Lyell’s grand work on the Principles of Geology...and yet does not admit how vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume. (p. 316) If you are detecting a certain stridency, you are not alone.And what was it that excited Darwin so much to dedicate his life to? Simply stated, it is the mechanism by which modifications occur within a species in response to environmental pressures. The same way that man could take the primordial wolf and encourage endless variations into hundreds of dog breeds, so could evolution (in what we would call today, micro-evolution) encourage those famous finches of Galapagos Islands to vary in beak sizes in adaptation to micro-environments.But Darwin wishes to go much further than that. In fact, he seems to indulge in frequent straw man arguments, saying that “special creation” would have no explanation for the facts he marshals, as though his critics assert dogs could only have been independently created at the beginning of time.Perhaps something like this was the prevailing wisdom at the time – that no species, or what we might call sub-species today, could develop into another. Yet, to contemporary ears, he doth protest too much.In fact, he takes his valuable insights and then extrapolates them to incredible lengths. (The theory of evolution remains just that, a theory, rather than the supreme law as treated by so many moderns.) His animation takes wing with passages such as this:	It is a truly wonderful fact – the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity – that all animal and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other... (p. 126) After long dancing around the controversial bush of his own creation, by book’s end he admits, “I believe that animals are descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or less number.” (p.502) But even here he prevaricates, for in the book’s last paragraph he triumphs, “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator [Nature?] into a few forms or into one...” (p.507) So which is it? Four or five or just one “form”? Either way, now we are really talking about Macro Evolution!Yet, sadly, not one concrete example – that has then or since been confirmed as a proven fact – is given of one species evolving into a wholly new one. (In fact, from our more modern understanding of mutations and how DNA works, mutations never allow for a gain in information, only its loss, which makes evolving from the simple ameoba to the incredibly complex human being patently impossible, the stuff of pure fantasy.)To his credit, Darwin brings up (what were at the time) the objections most “fatal,” or potentially fatal, to his theory. One was related to the fossil record, the other to how evolution could possibly explain for extremely complex organs which would have been useless when only partially created and, under the logic of the theory, would have been eradicated by natural selection long before completion.Let’s take the critical area of fossil evidence, or complete lack of it. Darwin readily admits there should be countless examples of intermediary forms (for example, showing how a reptile grew wings to become a bird), and asks:	Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely-graduated organic chain, and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory. (p.314) The reason, he answers back in 1859, is “that the geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect” (p.327), that is, we hadn’t dug up enough fossils yet.Jump ahead over 150 years, with numberless excavations and bones found all over the world, and there are still no such fossils. While there have been numerous hoaxes, including Piltdown Man, Nebraska Man, an the Archaeoraptor, or “dino-bird” – such is modern man’s obsession with trying to prove evolution – the lack of fossil record is a real brain-twister for evolutionists. As Colin Patterson, the late senior paleotogologist of the British Museum of Natural History, admitted, “there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.” (1979 letter to Luther D. Sutherland, cited in his “Darwin’s Enigma: Ebbing the Tide of Naturalism,” 1988, p. 89)The other big strike against evolution, forwarded by Darwin himself, was the feasibility of countless small evolutionary steps creating a complex organ which is all but worthless until whole. 	To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberation, could have been formed by natural selection seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. (p.172) His stab at explaining away the problem, as absurd as those by current apoligists, such as Richard Dawkins, is to find the tiniest benefit from even 100th of an eye which, multiplied over eons, brings us the remarkable present. For, “if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though unsuperable by our imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory.” (p.172) So something “unsuperable by our imagination’ should not be subversive to the theory?							 Yet, to my layman’s eyes, Darwin makes relatively few such categorical errors. Although DNA’s molecular structure would only be discovered nearly a century after the book’s launch, he rightly conjectures the inter-relatedness of all life, saying “that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking...” (p.437) as “the one known cause of close similarity in organic beings...” (p.432). Yes, it turns out all organisms were created with the same basic genetic code or language, known today as DNA.But he takes his conjectures to overwrought degrees, using morphology (the study of form and structure of organic beings) to imply all animals descend from the same ancestor (or two) and embryology to claim our ancient forms are revealed in early embryonic development. Among the many hoaxes used to try to confirm Darwin’s work, embryology as proof of evolution has, perhaps, the longest legs. Remember the Intro Biology chart which shows how the earliest human fetus has fish-like “gill slits” which proves that among our ancestors are dead fish? Or the one which supposedly demonstrates how all vertebrates look nearly identical soon after conception? Despite the drawings, originally from one Ernst Haeckel in 1874, having over a century ago been revealed as fakes, they still grace many biology textbooks.Much has changed since Darwin’s book was published, so we shouldn’t be too harsh on the man. You have to wonder, though, if Darwin were alive today and realized that fossil evidence still did not exist, would he be consistent and admit he went too far? (Today’s evolutionists have tried to explain away the lack of fossil record with a new theory, called punctuated equilibrium, or vast periods of no change followed by sudden and great leaps – hence the scarcity of fossils – but Darwin himself argues against it. (p.187))Darwin also believed in only a simple structure at the atom level, facilitating the idea that man could evolve from, say, an ameoba. But DNA has proven the opposite, that the number of genes within one human body of over 100 trillion equals the number of stars in 1,000 galaxies (of 100 billion stars each). We also now know that in mutations, the supposed engine of evolution, information is always lost and never gained.Knowing what we know today, would Darwin still believe in Darwinism?While his excitement in synthesizing a ground-breaking theory is palpable, did Darwin really need to macro-itize the obvious truth (in retrospect) of micro-evolution? It makes you wonder if there can be too much of a good thing. I recently read a review in the Wall Street Journal titled “The Ship of the Imagination” while pondering Darwin’s work. Rather breathlessly, the reviewer exults, “[the author] tracks other scientific efforts to achieve the apparently miraculous, including mind reading, the search for immortality, love potions, and the creation of demi-gods – or at least superhumans.” (Michael Saler, WSJ, 12/18/15) Could too much imagination be a bad thing?Since Darwin, science has become increasingly untethered from ethical considerations. Interestingly, as Vishal Mangalwadi pointed out in his magisterial “The Book That Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization,” no major new scientific laws have been formulated since in the last century following this untethering.Arguably, what we have now is less science than Scientism, where flawed theories such as Darwin’s have to be treated as the Law of the Land. The same Colin Patterson mentioned above searched for evolutionists who, out of the public glare, would stand up for evolution as we understand it today. Revealingly, from several such encounters he wrote:	I’ve tried putting a simple question to various people and groups of people. Question is: Can you tell me anything you about evolution, any one thing, that is true? I tried that question on the geology staff at the Field Museum of Natural History and the only answer I got was silence. I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary Morphology Seminar in the University of Chicago, a very prestigious body of evolutionists, and all I got there was silence for a long time and eventually one person said, “I do know one thing – it ought not be taught in high school.” (Cited in Stephen Jones, “Evolutionsm and Creationsim,” 11/5/82, p.1) Could it be that Darwin succumbed, too, to the vanity of his own imagination? And for how much longer must we carry him aloft?"

This has nothing to do with religion and humans are more a footnote. This is a biology book mostly about animals and natural selection. While this book talks a little about evolution, that's not really why it's important. I think some reviews and people focus too much on the history of this book rather than what is actually in this book. If you don't pick up the fact that Darwin was hugely into birds and they helped his studies, reread this book again. Every chapter he talks about some kind of bird and relates it to the primary subject. The controversy seems to have started by one little part in this book, but it's his other book where he talks about humans. He ignored humans for the most part because of Malthus.While this is an important read, this book gets boring if you're not interested in zoology or biology. I've said this before but I had ducks for three years, so I'm very interested in animal studies. I didn't really want to read this book before only because I knew my past self would find this boring. Just know what your about to read instead of thinking everyone needs to read this before they die."
186,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I’m doing a biology degree, and I’ve always been an admirer of (and a believer in) the theory of evolution through natural selection, so it seemed high time I finally went to hear it from the horse’s mouth. Not that Darwin came up with the idea out of nothing, of course; it was “in the air” at the time, and other scientists were thinking along similar lines — Lamarck and Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, to name just two. Not to mention, of course, Alfred Wallace, who could’ve beaten Darwin to publication.But Charles Darwin was the first to publish a theory which really made sense, which hung together and was testable. He may not have known about genetics or had a clear idea of how heritability occurs, yet it’s startling to read this and realise how close he was to right at times. He may not always have backed the right theories, but he considered everything he could imagine, and carefully related it to his own theory. It’s remarkable just how willing he was to consider where his theory might be wrong, and discuss those weaknesses. It’s also remarkable how often he tested what he could, whether it be the germination of seeds soaked in sea water or how pollination works; he may not have had the equipment that we have now, but his attitude is surely a lesson that every aspiring scientist should take to heart.Honestly, I don’t know how anyone can read this and come away without understanding Darwin’s theory. He’s painstakingly clear, at length, with examples. If you’re reading this and coming to the conclusion that he didn’t support the idea of one species evolving into another, “macroevolution”, your reading comprehension is at fault. He makes it quite clear that “microevolution”, small changes in existing species, can and will lead to new species.Darwin was not right about everything, but he was right in many key ways — and he would be the first to admit that he could be wrong. He gave us a working, testable theory, one which has ample proof both in his work and in the world around us. Creationists have far too much to explain, by comparison.Originally reviewed for breathesbooks.com."

""The Origin of the Species"", presented here in its full first edition format (because the next 5 editions of it were just more in depth renderings on the same subjects, with some response to subsequent criticism added on top) does not include a single page, line or speculation on the origin of man. That, Darwin left for another book - you guessed it - ""The Descent of Man"". I've been meaning to read Origin for a long time, and have finally gotten around to it, expecting to be impressed and have my curiosity satisfied. I am and it was. I won't talk here about the writing itself, because it truly is just a long form scientific paper detailing experiments and hypotheses, trials and tribulations and the knowledge Darwin and others had on the subject. But I will say this: when you're reading it, bear something in mind. Think about the nuclear bomb-like quality this book had at the time it was published in intellectual circles everywhere. Think about how it shook and shattered the foundations of a Church which had been in power for around 1800 years at that point. Imagine the heretical nature it must have had (as it has today) in the eyes of indoctrinated people. And then think about how easy it is today for schools to refuse teaching evolution because ""it offends"" them, because it's not the truth they want. A few men - Darwin included - have dedicated their lives to a truth that even they didn't like and believe to begin with; they struggled with their own findings; they hated that they couldn't find evidence that would be more in line with their beliefs from childhood. But they never let that stop them. And they have given us the foundation for entire fields of science, from which we benefit from this day, whether we choose to accept it or not. I tried to read Origins with the mentality of a mid 19th Century and 2018 individual at the same time... it's awesome from both vantage points. "

On the other hand, Darwin gives us an extensive detailed elaboration of his theory of evolution by means of natural selection.I wish he could have wrote more with regards to the humankind Species, but it was a different time, and writing this book was probably risky in itself.He was such a humble gentleman that he dedicated big portions of his book to the possible difficulties with his theory.I've read the Serbo-Croatian translation Postanak Vrsta autora Čarlsa Darvina / Akademska Knjiga 2009 6th Edition Publishing / 573 pages / 158,662 words."

It would have to be included on any short list of 'classics of science'. I have docked a star to reflect the fact that it's not always easy reading - there's that verbose quality to its style that characterizes most writing from the Victorian era. That said, I should point out that ""The Origin of Species"" is completely understandable to any general reader willing to give it a careful reading. You don't have to be a biologist to follow Darwin's argument. Two aspects of the book are astonishing; both underscore the brilliance of Darwin's accomplishment. The first is just how right he got things; the second is that he managed to fit all the major pieces of the puzzle in place with no knowledge of the actual mechanics of heredity. Mendel's work on genetics adn the elucidation of the structure of DNA would subsequently flesh out the details of the scheme proposed by Darwin; one has to bear in mind the actual state of knowledge in Darwin's time, and the prevailing intellectual climate, to appreciate fully the revolutionary nature of his argument. Upon re-reading the book this past weekend, I was reminded of certain endearing aspects that I had forgotten. One is Darwin's willingness to point out, and try to answer, what he perceived as the potential weaknesses in his argument. This is another: ""Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have, after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons"". Not quite as glamorous as the beasties he got to see from The Beagle, but he's continually observing, gathering data from any source available, always asking questions. You gotta love this book.

What I mainly found was:a) Creationists who didn’t read the book, but nonetheless needed to assert that humans are not descended from apes.b) Confused readers complaining about some obnoxious character called Alex. Since it was improbable that Darwin had given pet names to any creature whether living or fossilized, I looked into this one further and realized that a rather bad Nino Ricci novel was merged with Darwin’s science book. What a shame, Goodreads.c) Other confused readers who decided to give Darwin a one-star rating because of Ray Comfort’s introduction, which I think is utterly unfair to Darwin, although utterly fair to Comfort. Bash - Creationism Suite No.1 - PreludeThe edition I first started reading has a certain Ray Comfort gift us a very Special Introduction. This Mister – who also turns out to be a Christian Minister – desperately struggles to install the idea of a supreme being into Darwin’s theory before the latter gets a chance to speak. Mister Comfort Zone elaborates on moronic arguments that would make God himself flush with embarrassment, only to arrive at the conclusion that the complexity of life as we know it could not have evolved by chance (synonymous with eco-biochemistry in the creationist dialect). The conclusion of the book’s introduction, then, unlike the conclusion of the book itself, is that The Origin of Species is intelligent design.I’m surprised that decontextualizing quotes from prominent scientists to make them fit into the Comfort Combat is not considered an intellectual property infringement. The fact that this edition made it to print instead of court is very telling. For its disgraceful attempt at spoiling a science book with bad writing, the introduction deserves no stars at all. It’s almost a shame that it isn’t featured on GoodReads separately, but I won’t give Darwin’s book a low rating on its account. I’ll just pick another edition. The Origin of SpeciesReading On The Origin of Species isn’t about being introduced to a theory you know nothing about. Anyone remotely interested in evolution will reach this book as the culmination of a long winding road of scientific discoveries. It is still a priceless read, because of the quality of research and of its presentation. I have yet to find a work of art as beautiful as this science book.Darwin isn’t humorous in his writing. He is grave, patient, and humble. He is, beyond any doubt, the most modest of all the scientists I have ever met or read. Consider this: “To arrive at a just conclusion regarding the formation of the eye, with all its marvelous but not absolutely perfect characters, it is indispensable that the reason should conquer the imagination; but I have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at others hesitating to extend the principle of natural selection to so startling a length.” Moreover, he is so meticulous and precise that my sapient brain could die of fulfillment. Every tiny detail attended to—and there are so many—makes the whole of my intelligence appear tinier and tinier. It is most incredible that Darwin had to rely on empirical data, having no access to (and indeed no knowledge of) the genetic material, the basis of hereditable mutations. This intuition is beyond my comprehension. How could one man foresee such an immense and intricate scheme of things despite the widely accepted, unquestionable doctrines of his time?Compulsory Postscript: Tim Minchin on Americans and Evolution."

After reading it, I whole-heartedly agree with the statement. Only when one reads Darwin's perspective on such topics as breeding, domestic speciation, migration, instinct, etc. does one come to fully realize how much this book ushered in a new age of modern thought. The Theory of Evolution is so pervasive in the mindset of today's world that only by reading the work can one understand how much of a statement Darwin was making by risking its publication. He very literally changed the world or, rather, told us how it had been changed.Within the book Darwin also makes many references to the ""beauty"" and ""wonder"" of nature, something that I found quite fascinating considering how many (or at least some) believe his works to be the antithesis of religious ideals. I gained a respect for Darwin's knowledge and love for the natural world that surrounds us, and there is no question that his words caused me to appreciate nature in both a scientific and spiritual sense. As my opening quote demonstrates, you owe it to yourself to read this book. It changed the way mankind viewed the planet, their relationship with it and, indeed, their relationship with their very origins. ""There is grandeur in this view of life..."""

Because reading this is pure torture. I've studied Dawrin's theory so I was interested in the way he came up to those conclusions. I was pretty surprised that he even managed to do it considering how much he didn't know back then. But the way the book was written... I won't lie it's a great sleeping aid. The repetitions and multiple examples for the same thing must have been crucial for convincing people back then but made me scream. I hate evolutionary genetics because for some reason I find it extremely boring. Still this is one of the pillars of today's biology so as a biologist I had to read it.

However, in the last chapter, he takes his time to briefly explain to us everything he has taught us during his works, in order to makes us perceive the wonderful struggle for existence surrounding us.The book makes you feel something like ""you deserve to be amazing, because life took such a contrivance to conceive you""."

Trying Chap 2: ""I am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the cases of variability, even in important parts of structure, which he could collect on good authority, as I have collected, during a course of years. It should be remembered that systematists are far from being pleased at finding variability in important characters, and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs, and compare them in many specimens of the same species.""OK. Book of its time, and life is too short to wade through stuff like this. YMMV -- but I'm putting it on indefinite hiatus.

Darwin was unusually reflexive and tempered in his writing, probably owing at least in part to the heavy disapproval he know he would encounter from everyone from the clergy to other scientists, but props to him for writing in a way that is at once confident and humble. Reading this after Feyerabend's Against Method, the major thing I took away from it was that science should always leave itself open to the consideration of new theories, even if those theories contradict the logical systems that presently reign. In the case of Darwin, it is utterly apparent (to me) that Natural Selection is an ethical and valuable creation myth that opens the field of scientific inquiry to an untold number of fresh possibilities. That it was abused by so-called social Darwinists and other politically motivated actors only reinforces my feeling that the ethical implications of all scientific theory should be subjected to at least as much rigor as data, methodology, and repeatability.Finally, Darwin uses awesome examples of strange animals."

But even from a strictly layperson's view, there are a number of things about The Origin of Species that greatly impressed me.His careful observations. It is obvious that he cared deeply about his work. He had made careful observations and comparisons about many species, both plants and animals. It is quite clear that he passionately loved nature.""He must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a [honey]comb, so beautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration.His elegant use of language. While the target audience of The Origin was his fellow scientists, he wrote clearly and plainly enough that a non-scientist could follow the main points of his argument. At the same time, there is a beauty and elegance in his use of language:""... it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts... not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.""His humility. He openly admitted the weak points of his theory - in fact, there is an entire chapter entitled ""Difficulties on Theory."" In addition, he gave credit to other scientists for their contributions to both his and their own fields of research. And yet, he doesn't back down in the face of objections. Consider this emphatic statement concerning geologic time:""He who can read Sir Charles Lyell's grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future historian will recognize as having produced a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how incomprehensibly vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume."" The fact that Darwin reached his conclusions from observation and experiment before the birth of modern genetics is even more remarkable. His postulation  ...that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other... has certainly been proven true by modern DNA evidence.It goes without saying that a considerable amount of his work has been superseded with newer and more accurate findings. Mr. Darwin died before the development of the theories of continental drift and plate tectonics. While reading this, I couldn't help thinking how amazed he would be if he were able to see all of today's various fields of science, especially DNA research. ""The whole history of the world, as at present known, although of a length quite incomprehensible by us, will hereafter be recognized as a mere fragment of time, compared with the ages which have lapsed since the first creature, the progenitor of innnumerable extinct and living descendants, was created. In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches.""Now for the criticism. Mr. Darwin tends to repeat himself. Perhaps he did this on purpose to reiterate his position. I confess, I skimmed the final chapter titled ""Recapitulation and Conclusion."" Also, as has been often noted, Darwin was in a rush to publish and omitted quite a lot of data that supported his conclusions. As Thomas Henry Huxley said about The Origin of Species:...a sort of intellectual pemmican - a mass of facts crushed and pounded into shape, rather than held together by the ordinary medium of an obvious logical bond...Again, for sheer want of room, much has to be taken for granted which might readily enough be proved... the novice in biology is apt to complain of the frequency of what he fancies is gratuitous assumption .(Yet, in spite of those rather harsh words, Huxley was one of the most vocal and vehement supporters of Darwin's theory, becoming known as ""Darwin's Bulldog."")"

The Apollo guidance computer had less computing power than average modern family car. This is how we should view Darwin's 'Origin Of The Species'. It is an absolute triumph of empirical evidence based science. By the most constant and careful observation of the natural world Darwin not only worked out the theory of evolution he also quite correctly realised that all life forms on this planet are related to one another, ""by which all living and extinct beings are united by complex,radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand system""The first two chapters and the last chapter are where the general reader can feel the sparkle of Darwin's ideas and his profound infatuation with nature and its works. These chapters are also the best written and not surprisingly are a thrilling rush of theory and ideas.The vast bulk of the work is the minutiae of his ideas. It is, I have to say, cumbersome to read. It is the sort of sub clausal slog that a lot of nineteenth century writing gets bogged down in. Darwin's modesty in quoting and attributing to others and his unfailing scientific fearlessness in saying 'OK here is where my theory falls over' makes him a figure of unimpeachable scientific integrity.After reading this book I can understand the affection and respect that Darwin has been held in by those who try to base their lives in reason and science."

Definitely 5/5.Darwin's theory in a nutshell: Nature selects organisms with certain features (variations) to pass on their traits that help them survive (against competition – for food, shelter, mates – the environment and predators), forming different species (descendants with modification from a common ancestor) over many generations. Other factors that contribute to natural selection: diversification, living conditions, disuse of body parts. The species that can’t develop such traits eventually go extinct because nature keeps populations in balance (no population can grow forever, not even us: see Lovelock).Natural selection also modifies instincts (e.g. geometrically perfect beehives), and through variations in their reproductive systems why different species can’t procreate with one another (and if they do, their offspring is sterile)"

Which was my first encounter in Charles Darwin and all he and his work was about - Darwin’s finches, natural selection, evolution over time and his revolutionary voyage on the HMS Beagle was in just about every genetics module and evolution base modules I was taught. I’ve been encountering snippets of his work all throughout my studies, a quote here, an excerpt there and thought it was about time I go straight to the source and read On the Origin of Species. It’s such an original, a legend in its own right in its revolutionary reports and observations. I find it quite frankly amazing how much this amazing man deduced and discovered considering it was during a time when many of the scientific discoveries we have come to know now as common knowledge (like DNA) were unheard of back then. I’m glad I finally got round the reading the writings of the man who shaped our world in so many ways with the science he produced in this book. I feel like I can call myself a scientist and a science lover now that I’ve read these writings that’s at the heart of our genetics and evolutionary knowledge, providing the foundations to springboard into our current age of scientific enlightenment and discovery!"

In the twenty-first century, this book should not be read for the science it. Darwin didn’t know mutations, he didn’t even know Mendel’s Laws! The important thing about this book is the change of world view it brought: we, humans, are not special! This story is not about us! In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us: we became self aware only to realize we are not protagonists. We are not on the top of the evolutionary scale, we are not more perfect than other living beings. This story began much before us and will probably end long after us. “Origin” helped us realize that.Darwin was a man ahead of his time, and I admire him greatly.Excellent read! "
204,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334545-david-s-t,3,"I figured while I was on my evolution book kick, I might as well go back to the original (well sort of the original, Alfred Russel Wallace published a paper on natural selection which prompted Darwin to publish this “abstract”). Now that I'm finished I feel two different ways about the book, a loved yet bored type of feeling. First I'm amazed at just how much of Darwin's theories and ideas are accurate and accepted even today 150 years later (which is a pretty darn long time in science). One thing you have to appreciate about this book is that its pretty evident that Darwin didn't just rush out and publish this theories but thought about every possible question everyone could have and he attempts to answer them all. Another question he spends a lot of time on is how flora could make it to islands, he goes through page after page of experiments trying to see how long seeds can stay in salt water and still germinate. Even better way back 150 years ago Darwin already anticipated the irreducible complexity argument of the eye and proposed his own ideas about how the eye could evolve and how each gradation is useful in itself. Some times the prose was pretty amazing, I think the famous line about “There is grandeur in this view of life.....” is one of my favorites in any book I've read.So as amazing as some parts where why then did I rate it 3 stars? Well for every amazing part there are page after page of material which is (to me) just plain boring. The prose which is great in sections is pretty tedious in other parts. The fact that he thought of every question means that he goes over proof after proof. Remember the salt water and the seeds mentioned above, well its cool at first but 40 pages of his experiments makes me start to care less and less. There were also a few parts which he got wrong, he spends a whole section trying to figure out why certain animals can't cross breed, something which is quickly addressed now days with DNA. I think at another part he denies that there ever were any mass extinctions (something we know happened several times in the earth's history). Another thing which made the book a little harder for me is Darwin mentions lots of people and animals I've never heard of, of course a better reader would have spend time looking them up but I just read on, I guess I didn't care enough to do that much research for the book. So overall for importance I'd rate this book a 5/5, but I have to factor in enjoyment and I so its gets the lower score. Truthfully this book is 150 years old and written in Victorian English, its very important, but there are better books on evolution out there, so if you're curious about the fascinating world of evolution, start elsewhere, only if you're curious about how the theory got started pick this one up.

205,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"I've probably listened to and rated over 15 books about evolution over the last two years, but I was always hesitant to read the granddaddy of them all. I should not have been and am glad I did for the following reasons,1) The book reads as well as any of the good popular science books available on audible. It is written as if his attended audience is for a 13 year old. That's how good of a writer Darwin is.2) I had obtained a google book version, but couldn't bring myself to read it, and I had obtained a free audio version floating around the net, but this audio version is professionally read and doesn't suffer at all from the narrator.3) The book lays out a very complicated argument in 13 basically independent chapters. Each chapter by itself is enough to convince the listener of the fact of evolution by natural selection. The author is very smooth at telling you what he's going to tell you, then tell you, and then explain to you what he has just told you.4) The book is a guidebook on how to lay out an argument and convince others to your viewpoint. He makes sure that he fairly presents criticism that could attack his theory and refutes it masterfully.5) My favorite reason for having read this book is that my smugness index has gone up. When I come across people who haven't read the book and deny the scientific fact of evolution I can now say that I have listened to the book and smugly add statements like ""even a thirteen year old can understand evolution, haven't you even read 'On the Origin of Species'""."

In all honesty, this one was a challenge to get through at times -- often tedious in the sheer amount of detail, and the frequent repetition and reiteration of key arguments. I wish it had been about half as long, but I'm glad to be able to say I've read it. All that said, this book is a tour de force. The mark of a good theory is that it seems blatantly obvious in retrospect. I often had to remind myself what a revolutionary idea this was at the time, and yet the strength of Darwin's argument is overwhelming. The breadth and depth of his knowledge and research is also astonishing -- from talking about crossbreeds of plants I've never even heard of, to laying out the specific geological conditions under which fossils can be formed. It's hard to believe that he was able to lay out this theory well before the discovery of Mendelian inheritance (let alone DNA) and Pangea. The fact that he was able to come up with this elegant explanation of the origin of species without that knowledge, and still make such a compelling argument for it, is so impressive. ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."""

210,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"So this is the foundation of the theory of evolution. No, Darwin was not the first or only one with musings much like the ones described in this book, but he took some other people's theories (incl. that of his own grandfather) and took them further or perfected them.After having spent 5 years on the Beagle and thus seeing all kinds of places, Darwin had returned to England. It would be many years before he published this book but during the last stretch of the journey, Darwin had discovered something along some of the specimen he had collected on the Galápagos Islands. No, it was not his famous finches. Those he had forgotten (or not known) to label, thus no longer knowing which bird came from which of the islands. It was also not the famous tortoises as every single one of the ones taken on board the Beagle had been eaten and the shell been thrown overboard.Luckily, there were still the mockingbirds. And like all animals on the Galápagos, they too were different on every island and he HAD labelled them.Thus, he saw that while they were all mockingbirds, they had slight differences, especially when it came to their beaks, which gave him the idea of them being specialized to the life conditions on their respective island.It was also the Galápagos Islands that gave him the idea of volcanic activity birthing an island. He just didn't know about plate tectonics yet, sadly, as that theory was only established (and proven) about 100 years later.Thus, he talks of evolution as nature's way of selecting traits most suited for whatever life a creature lives. He talks about sexual selection and extinction of animals.Think back to those times: mankind thought themselves the master of the Earth, as God had willed it. God, the omnipotent being, had created all things. Evolution, therefore, was blasphemy as it meant God either at least changing his mind or having made mistakes. You can imagine how some people reacted once this book had been written and published.However, while reading this book, I was delighted to see that Darwin never bashed religious people but simply didn't talk about religion at all. Maybe he had learned not to broach the subject since he was married to a Catholic. *lol* Instead, he simply laid out his theory and his reasons for having established it, giving ample proof while listing the single steps. And whenever there was a gap, he would address it and explain why it was there, what the likely answer was and, again, why.I was astonished and more than pleased to see how he had written this book. Much like in his journal about the voyage on the Beagle, he shows a beautiful writing style and wrote this book not only for scholars but - and this was radical as well - for the layman to understand. A complex and new concept explained in a simple way to make the science accessible.Like when he talked about humans breeding dogs to be of a certain size and character traits or gardeners crossing different flowers to get certain petal shapes and colours.He took Humboldt's ""web of life"" and transformed it into his famous ""tree of life"". There were a few minor errors (we know now) but all in all, his logic was sound - only limited, sometimes, by some thing or other that hadn't yet been discovered or explained. My hardcover edition had beautiful illustrations. Some were Darwin's sketches, other were oil paintings of animals he was talking about in the book. However, much like with the other book, there is an audio version narrated by Dawkins that is really very good despite being abridged.Where humankind would be without Darwin and this book, I do not know. We owe Darwin and his work a lot, though, that's for sure."
211,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92443064-andra,0,"It is difficult to rate this, as Charles Darwin is evidently not a writer. His work and theories, however, I find genius."
212,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477945-kendall,5,"Finally re-read after decades of good intentions. For a recondite classic it is full of surprises, mostly pleasant; its supposed impenetrability largely confined to parts we already knew were directed at specialists—I admit to slogging through the section on barnacles, for example. But Origins is highly readable, pleasurable even, almost in the way of an Edmund Wilson essay. Darwin proceeds deliberately through the mountain of evidence he collected over twenty years as he constructs a virtually unassailable intellectual structure. Freely recognizing arguments against natural selection—the central thread of the book—he gives his best arguments based on the knowledge of his day while carefully pointing out its limitations. I was not prepared for how well he anticipated later discoveries—Mendel’s pioneering work in genetics didn’t see publication until the early 20th century yet dovetails almost seamlessly into Origins exposition, as does the Modern Synthesis. If you’re interested in any of the broad fields of biology-evolution, taxonomy, genetics—The Origin of Species is a must read. If you are a creationist, even in its deceptive guise of intelligent design, you are not intellectually honest if you have not read and honestly come to grips with this book; which gives the lie to the railings of a few misguided Christians and Muslims who seem to think it a product of their devil.

213,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,4,"In reading The Origin of Species, one of the things I found myself respecting most about Charles Darwin was his aversion to dogma, religious or otherwise. He was generally logical, reasonable, and slow to jump to conclusions, and it seems to me that the enduring quality of this book owes much to these traits in its author. 
""From these and similar considerations, but chiefly from our ignorance of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United States; and from the revolution in our palæontological ideas on many points, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected, it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of organic beings throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its productions.""
"
214,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13229843-ben-batchelder,1,"Charles Darwin’s “The Origin of Species” promises a lot. A back cover blurb says, “Next to the Bible no work has been quite as influential....” I’m not a scientist, but with a build up like that I had to give it a try after enjoying “The Voyage of the Beagle” (reviewed 9/5/13).It is a slog of a read, yet Darwin’s enthusiasm for his subject, the excitement he conveys in outlining the work of his lifetime and popularizing a scientific movement, are palpable. Ironically, Darwin was not a scientist himself, but a “naturalist,” whose first job in the field – to be the Beagle’s naturalist-on-board – was a bit of a lark, suggested by friends, after his prior path to becoming an Anglican pastor (his father’s preference) came to naught.His insights – not entirely original, as he really consolidated lines of thinking going on for several generations – stemmed not only from his visit to the Galapagos Islands on the Beagle, but from observing man-driven selection in the breeding of domesticated animals.  I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man’s power of selection. But the expression...Survival of the Fittest is more accurate...” (p.61) Yet the problems start right away. As Creationist Kent Hovind has pointed out, the assumption that natural selection causes evolution is problematic, for “natural selection” never creates, it only selects. Furthermore, “survival of the fittest” is a tautology, for by definition the fit survive and the survivors are fit. As Hovind points out, natural selection might be more clearly called differential reproduction, that is, some reproduce more than others.And what drove Darwin to this line of thinking? It turns out he was a Malthusian, the Chicken Little of his time:It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them. (p. 63) The implication being, for some to live, others must die. Death, then, turns out to be the selection method of the Universe, in the never-ending struggle to survive. Or, as he succinctly states, “Thus, extinction and natural selection go hand in hand.” (p.161)Sensing how grim his outlook might appear, Darwin tries to pre-empt: When we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply. (p.75) Call it the theory of Happy Death then, one of many assertions that don’t ring true. No fear is felt? Death is generally prompt? Well, then, bring on more of this necessary (per Malthus) and creative force!Elevating nature to a Capitalized Power, Darwin characterizes it as less selfish than we: “Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends.” (p.79)Around this part of the book came the first of many mentions (that I noticed) of the phrase “scale of nature,” which of course is a direct descendent of Plato’s and Aristotle’s Scala Naturae, showing a direct link to the pagan concept of a hierarchy of development that was transformed into the the Great Chain of Being by the Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century. This pagan belief in a hierarcy of more and less developed beings may have influenced Darwin’s unfortunate choice of sub-title: “By Means of Natural Selection of the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.” It is difficult to find a modern edition of the book that hasn’t scrubbed clean this evidence of Darwin’s easy racism. (Only in my 150th Anniversary Edition, from Signet Classics in 2003, could I find the sub-title in any edition on-line – tucked away in a title page inside.) One can see why Darwin’s boosters try to re-write history, for the sub-title’s “favoured races” helps explain how Social Darwinism – only disavowed by evolution’s supporters after the horrors of WWII – created so much havoc in the 20th century. (Marx and Stalin were nominally Christian before reading Darwin; both Stalin and Hitler appropriated Darwin for their perverted, murderous philosophies.)In terms of other influences, Darwin often refers to Charles Lyell and his (literally) ground-breaking “Principles of Geology” which, by positing long geological ages, gave breathing room for Darwin’s theory of numerous “slight variations” to evolve, of minuscule improvements multiplied over unimaginably many iterations. He goes so far as to warn skeptical readers:	He who can read Sir Charles Lyell’s grand work on the Principles of Geology...and yet does not admit how vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume. (p. 316) If you are detecting a certain stridency, you are not alone.And what was it that excited Darwin so much to dedicate his life to? Simply stated, it is the mechanism by which modifications occur within a species in response to environmental pressures. The same way that man could take the primordial wolf and encourage endless variations into hundreds of dog breeds, so could evolution (in what we would call today, micro-evolution) encourage those famous finches of Galapagos Islands to vary in beak sizes in adaptation to micro-environments.But Darwin wishes to go much further than that. In fact, he seems to indulge in frequent straw man arguments, saying that “special creation” would have no explanation for the facts he marshals, as though his critics assert dogs could only have been independently created at the beginning of time.Perhaps something like this was the prevailing wisdom at the time – that no species, or what we might call sub-species today, could develop into another. Yet, to contemporary ears, he doth protest too much.In fact, he takes his valuable insights and then extrapolates them to incredible lengths. (The theory of evolution remains just that, a theory, rather than the supreme law as treated by so many moderns.) His animation takes wing with passages such as this:	It is a truly wonderful fact – the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity – that all animal and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other... (p. 126) After long dancing around the controversial bush of his own creation, by book’s end he admits, “I believe that animals are descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or less number.” (p.502) But even here he prevaricates, for in the book’s last paragraph he triumphs, “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator [Nature?] into a few forms or into one...” (p.507) So which is it? Four or five or just one “form”? Either way, now we are really talking about Macro Evolution!Yet, sadly, not one concrete example – that has then or since been confirmed as a proven fact – is given of one species evolving into a wholly new one. (In fact, from our more modern understanding of mutations and how DNA works, mutations never allow for a gain in information, only its loss, which makes evolving from the simple ameoba to the incredibly complex human being patently impossible, the stuff of pure fantasy.)To his credit, Darwin brings up (what were at the time) the objections most “fatal,” or potentially fatal, to his theory. One was related to the fossil record, the other to how evolution could possibly explain for extremely complex organs which would have been useless when only partially created and, under the logic of the theory, would have been eradicated by natural selection long before completion.Let’s take the critical area of fossil evidence, or complete lack of it. Darwin readily admits there should be countless examples of intermediary forms (for example, showing how a reptile grew wings to become a bird), and asks:	Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely-graduated organic chain, and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory. (p.314) The reason, he answers back in 1859, is “that the geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect” (p.327), that is, we hadn’t dug up enough fossils yet.Jump ahead over 150 years, with numberless excavations and bones found all over the world, and there are still no such fossils. While there have been numerous hoaxes, including Piltdown Man, Nebraska Man, an the Archaeoraptor, or “dino-bird” – such is modern man’s obsession with trying to prove evolution – the lack of fossil record is a real brain-twister for evolutionists. As Colin Patterson, the late senior paleotogologist of the British Museum of Natural History, admitted, “there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.” (1979 letter to Luther D. Sutherland, cited in his “Darwin’s Enigma: Ebbing the Tide of Naturalism,” 1988, p. 89)The other big strike against evolution, forwarded by Darwin himself, was the feasibility of countless small evolutionary steps creating a complex organ which is all but worthless until whole. 	To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberation, could have been formed by natural selection seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. (p.172) His stab at explaining away the problem, as absurd as those by current apoligists, such as Richard Dawkins, is to find the tiniest benefit from even 100th of an eye which, multiplied over eons, brings us the remarkable present. For, “if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though unsuperable by our imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory.” (p.172) So something “unsuperable by our imagination’ should not be subversive to the theory?							 Yet, to my layman’s eyes, Darwin makes relatively few such categorical errors. Although DNA’s molecular structure would only be discovered nearly a century after the book’s launch, he rightly conjectures the inter-relatedness of all life, saying “that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking...” (p.437) as “the one known cause of close similarity in organic beings...” (p.432). Yes, it turns out all organisms were created with the same basic genetic code or language, known today as DNA.But he takes his conjectures to overwrought degrees, using morphology (the study of form and structure of organic beings) to imply all animals descend from the same ancestor (or two) and embryology to claim our ancient forms are revealed in early embryonic development. Among the many hoaxes used to try to confirm Darwin’s work, embryology as proof of evolution has, perhaps, the longest legs. Remember the Intro Biology chart which shows how the earliest human fetus has fish-like “gill slits” which proves that among our ancestors are dead fish? Or the one which supposedly demonstrates how all vertebrates look nearly identical soon after conception? Despite the drawings, originally from one Ernst Haeckel in 1874, having over a century ago been revealed as fakes, they still grace many biology textbooks.Much has changed since Darwin’s book was published, so we shouldn’t be too harsh on the man. You have to wonder, though, if Darwin were alive today and realized that fossil evidence still did not exist, would he be consistent and admit he went too far? (Today’s evolutionists have tried to explain away the lack of fossil record with a new theory, called punctuated equilibrium, or vast periods of no change followed by sudden and great leaps – hence the scarcity of fossils – but Darwin himself argues against it. (p.187))Darwin also believed in only a simple structure at the atom level, facilitating the idea that man could evolve from, say, an ameoba. But DNA has proven the opposite, that the number of genes within one human body of over 100 trillion equals the number of stars in 1,000 galaxies (of 100 billion stars each). We also now know that in mutations, the supposed engine of evolution, information is always lost and never gained.Knowing what we know today, would Darwin still believe in Darwinism?While his excitement in synthesizing a ground-breaking theory is palpable, did Darwin really need to macro-itize the obvious truth (in retrospect) of micro-evolution? It makes you wonder if there can be too much of a good thing. I recently read a review in the Wall Street Journal titled “The Ship of the Imagination” while pondering Darwin’s work. Rather breathlessly, the reviewer exults, “[the author] tracks other scientific efforts to achieve the apparently miraculous, including mind reading, the search for immortality, love potions, and the creation of demi-gods – or at least superhumans.” (Michael Saler, WSJ, 12/18/15) Could too much imagination be a bad thing?Since Darwin, science has become increasingly untethered from ethical considerations. Interestingly, as Vishal Mangalwadi pointed out in his magisterial “The Book That Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization,” no major new scientific laws have been formulated since in the last century following this untethering.Arguably, what we have now is less science than Scientism, where flawed theories such as Darwin’s have to be treated as the Law of the Land. The same Colin Patterson mentioned above searched for evolutionists who, out of the public glare, would stand up for evolution as we understand it today. Revealingly, from several such encounters he wrote:	I’ve tried putting a simple question to various people and groups of people. Question is: Can you tell me anything you about evolution, any one thing, that is true? I tried that question on the geology staff at the Field Museum of Natural History and the only answer I got was silence. I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary Morphology Seminar in the University of Chicago, a very prestigious body of evolutionists, and all I got there was silence for a long time and eventually one person said, “I do know one thing – it ought not be taught in high school.” (Cited in Stephen Jones, “Evolutionsm and Creationsim,” 11/5/82, p.1) Could it be that Darwin succumbed, too, to the vanity of his own imagination? And for how much longer must we carry him aloft?"

This has nothing to do with religion and humans are more a footnote. This is a biology book mostly about animals and natural selection. While this book talks a little about evolution, that's not really why it's important. I think some reviews and people focus too much on the history of this book rather than what is actually in this book. If you don't pick up the fact that Darwin was hugely into birds and they helped his studies, reread this book again. Every chapter he talks about some kind of bird and relates it to the primary subject. The controversy seems to have started by one little part in this book, but it's his other book where he talks about humans. He ignored humans for the most part because of Malthus.While this is an important read, this book gets boring if you're not interested in zoology or biology. I've said this before but I had ducks for three years, so I'm very interested in animal studies. I didn't really want to read this book before only because I knew my past self would find this boring. Just know what your about to read instead of thinking everyone needs to read this before they die."
216,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I’m doing a biology degree, and I’ve always been an admirer of (and a believer in) the theory of evolution through natural selection, so it seemed high time I finally went to hear it from the horse’s mouth. Not that Darwin came up with the idea out of nothing, of course; it was “in the air” at the time, and other scientists were thinking along similar lines — Lamarck and Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, to name just two. Not to mention, of course, Alfred Wallace, who could’ve beaten Darwin to publication.But Charles Darwin was the first to publish a theory which really made sense, which hung together and was testable. He may not have known about genetics or had a clear idea of how heritability occurs, yet it’s startling to read this and realise how close he was to right at times. He may not always have backed the right theories, but he considered everything he could imagine, and carefully related it to his own theory. It’s remarkable just how willing he was to consider where his theory might be wrong, and discuss those weaknesses. It’s also remarkable how often he tested what he could, whether it be the germination of seeds soaked in sea water or how pollination works; he may not have had the equipment that we have now, but his attitude is surely a lesson that every aspiring scientist should take to heart.Honestly, I don’t know how anyone can read this and come away without understanding Darwin’s theory. He’s painstakingly clear, at length, with examples. If you’re reading this and coming to the conclusion that he didn’t support the idea of one species evolving into another, “macroevolution”, your reading comprehension is at fault. He makes it quite clear that “microevolution”, small changes in existing species, can and will lead to new species.Darwin was not right about everything, but he was right in many key ways — and he would be the first to admit that he could be wrong. He gave us a working, testable theory, one which has ample proof both in his work and in the world around us. Creationists have far too much to explain, by comparison.Originally reviewed for breathesbooks.com."

""The Origin of the Species"", presented here in its full first edition format (because the next 5 editions of it were just more in depth renderings on the same subjects, with some response to subsequent criticism added on top) does not include a single page, line or speculation on the origin of man. That, Darwin left for another book - you guessed it - ""The Descent of Man"". I've been meaning to read Origin for a long time, and have finally gotten around to it, expecting to be impressed and have my curiosity satisfied. I am and it was. I won't talk here about the writing itself, because it truly is just a long form scientific paper detailing experiments and hypotheses, trials and tribulations and the knowledge Darwin and others had on the subject. But I will say this: when you're reading it, bear something in mind. Think about the nuclear bomb-like quality this book had at the time it was published in intellectual circles everywhere. Think about how it shook and shattered the foundations of a Church which had been in power for around 1800 years at that point. Imagine the heretical nature it must have had (as it has today) in the eyes of indoctrinated people. And then think about how easy it is today for schools to refuse teaching evolution because ""it offends"" them, because it's not the truth they want. A few men - Darwin included - have dedicated their lives to a truth that even they didn't like and believe to begin with; they struggled with their own findings; they hated that they couldn't find evidence that would be more in line with their beliefs from childhood. But they never let that stop them. And they have given us the foundation for entire fields of science, from which we benefit from this day, whether we choose to accept it or not. I tried to read Origins with the mentality of a mid 19th Century and 2018 individual at the same time... it's awesome from both vantage points. "

Charles Darwin is the prophet of the natural selection theory and the Godfather of the struggle for survival.Darwin's work ""On The Origin of Species"" gives you a feel at times that you're reading something between a textbook and a book. This book is a short summary of his Voyage and 15 years of studying and researching organisms prior to writing this book. On the other hand, Darwin gives us an extensive detailed elaboration of his theory of evolution by means of natural selection.I wish he could have wrote more with regards to the humankind Species, but it was a different time, and writing this book was probably risky in itself.He was such a humble gentleman that he dedicated big portions of his book to the possible difficulties with his theory.I've read the Serbo-Croatian translation Postanak Vrsta autora Čarlsa Darvina / Akademska Knjiga 2009 6th Edition Publishing / 573 pages / 158,662 words."

It would have to be included on any short list of 'classics of science'. I have docked a star to reflect the fact that it's not always easy reading - there's that verbose quality to its style that characterizes most writing from the Victorian era. That said, I should point out that ""The Origin of Species"" is completely understandable to any general reader willing to give it a careful reading. You don't have to be a biologist to follow Darwin's argument. Two aspects of the book are astonishing; both underscore the brilliance of Darwin's accomplishment. The first is just how right he got things; the second is that he managed to fit all the major pieces of the puzzle in place with no knowledge of the actual mechanics of heredity. Mendel's work on genetics adn the elucidation of the structure of DNA would subsequently flesh out the details of the scheme proposed by Darwin; one has to bear in mind the actual state of knowledge in Darwin's time, and the prevailing intellectual climate, to appreciate fully the revolutionary nature of his argument. Upon re-reading the book this past weekend, I was reminded of certain endearing aspects that I had forgotten. One is Darwin's willingness to point out, and try to answer, what he perceived as the potential weaknesses in his argument. This is another: ""Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have, after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons"". Not quite as glamorous as the beasties he got to see from The Beagle, but he's continually observing, gathering data from any source available, always asking questions. You gotta love this book.

220,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33352366-elari,5,"As I was going through the Origin of Species page on Goodreads, I decided to check some of the one-star reviews. What I mainly found was:a) Creationists who didn’t read the book, but nonetheless needed to assert that humans are not descended from apes.b) Confused readers complaining about some obnoxious character called Alex. Since it was improbable that Darwin had given pet names to any creature whether living or fossilized, I looked into this one further and realized that a rather bad Nino Ricci novel was merged with Darwin’s science book. What a shame, Goodreads.c) Other confused readers who decided to give Darwin a one-star rating because of Ray Comfort’s introduction, which I think is utterly unfair to Darwin, although utterly fair to Comfort. Bash - Creationism Suite No.1 - PreludeThe edition I first started reading has a certain Ray Comfort gift us a very Special Introduction. This Mister – who also turns out to be a Christian Minister – desperately struggles to install the idea of a supreme being into Darwin’s theory before the latter gets a chance to speak. Mister Comfort Zone elaborates on moronic arguments that would make God himself flush with embarrassment, only to arrive at the conclusion that the complexity of life as we know it could not have evolved by chance (synonymous with eco-biochemistry in the creationist dialect). The conclusion of the book’s introduction, then, unlike the conclusion of the book itself, is that The Origin of Species is intelligent design.I’m surprised that decontextualizing quotes from prominent scientists to make them fit into the Comfort Combat is not considered an intellectual property infringement. The fact that this edition made it to print instead of court is very telling. For its disgraceful attempt at spoiling a science book with bad writing, the introduction deserves no stars at all. It’s almost a shame that it isn’t featured on GoodReads separately, but I won’t give Darwin’s book a low rating on its account. I’ll just pick another edition. The Origin of SpeciesReading On The Origin of Species isn’t about being introduced to a theory you know nothing about. Anyone remotely interested in evolution will reach this book as the culmination of a long winding road of scientific discoveries. It is still a priceless read, because of the quality of research and of its presentation. I have yet to find a work of art as beautiful as this science book.Darwin isn’t humorous in his writing. He is grave, patient, and humble. He is, beyond any doubt, the most modest of all the scientists I have ever met or read. Consider this: “To arrive at a just conclusion regarding the formation of the eye, with all its marvelous but not absolutely perfect characters, it is indispensable that the reason should conquer the imagination; but I have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at others hesitating to extend the principle of natural selection to so startling a length.” Moreover, he is so meticulous and precise that my sapient brain could die of fulfillment. Every tiny detail attended to—and there are so many—makes the whole of my intelligence appear tinier and tinier. It is most incredible that Darwin had to rely on empirical data, having no access to (and indeed no knowledge of) the genetic material, the basis of hereditable mutations. This intuition is beyond my comprehension. How could one man foresee such an immense and intricate scheme of things despite the widely accepted, unquestionable doctrines of his time?Compulsory Postscript: Tim Minchin on Americans and Evolution."

After reading it, I whole-heartedly agree with the statement. Only when one reads Darwin's perspective on such topics as breeding, domestic speciation, migration, instinct, etc. does one come to fully realize how much this book ushered in a new age of modern thought. The Theory of Evolution is so pervasive in the mindset of today's world that only by reading the work can one understand how much of a statement Darwin was making by risking its publication. He very literally changed the world or, rather, told us how it had been changed.Within the book Darwin also makes many references to the ""beauty"" and ""wonder"" of nature, something that I found quite fascinating considering how many (or at least some) believe his works to be the antithesis of religious ideals. I gained a respect for Darwin's knowledge and love for the natural world that surrounds us, and there is no question that his words caused me to appreciate nature in both a scientific and spiritual sense. As my opening quote demonstrates, you owe it to yourself to read this book. It changed the way mankind viewed the planet, their relationship with it and, indeed, their relationship with their very origins. ""There is grandeur in this view of life..."""

A banned book.I can't rate this book honestly because I tend to rate books based on my feelings and I just can't rate this fundamental for science book the one star my feelings demand. Because reading this is pure torture. I've studied Dawrin's theory so I was interested in the way he came up to those conclusions. I was pretty surprised that he even managed to do it considering how much he didn't know back then. But the way the book was written... I won't lie it's a great sleeping aid. The repetitions and multiple examples for the same thing must have been crucial for convincing people back then but made me scream. I hate evolutionary genetics because for some reason I find it extremely boring. Still this is one of the pillars of today's biology so as a biologist I had to read it. But if you want to actually learn about Darwin's theory go find a biology textbook - it's explained much better. Or rather it's explained without all the boring details.

However, in the last chapter, he takes his time to briefly explain to us everything he has taught us during his works, in order to makes us perceive the wonderful struggle for existence surrounding us.The book makes you feel something like ""you deserve to be amazing, because life took such a contrivance to conceive you""."

OK, then! On to Chap. 1: ""When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of character than in true species. Domestic races often have a somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although differing from each other and from other species of the same genus, in several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part..."" Less turgid, but still pretty tough sledding, at least for me.

Darwin was unusually reflexive and tempered in his writing, probably owing at least in part to the heavy disapproval he know he would encounter from everyone from the clergy to other scientists, but props to him for writing in a way that is at once confident and humble. Reading this after Feyerabend's Against Method, the major thing I took away from it was that science should always leave itself open to the consideration of new theories, even if those theories contradict the logical systems that presently reign. In the case of Darwin, it is utterly apparent (to me) that Natural Selection is an ethical and valuable creation myth that opens the field of scientific inquiry to an untold number of fresh possibilities. That it was abused by so-called social Darwinists and other politically motivated actors only reinforces my feeling that the ethical implications of all scientific theory should be subjected to at least as much rigor as data, methodology, and repeatability.Finally, Darwin uses awesome examples of strange animals."

But even from a strictly layperson's view, there are a number of things about The Origin of Species that greatly impressed me.His careful observations. It is obvious that he cared deeply about his work. He had made careful observations and comparisons about many species, both plants and animals. It is quite clear that he passionately loved nature.""He must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a [honey]comb, so beautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration.His elegant use of language. While the target audience of The Origin was his fellow scientists, he wrote clearly and plainly enough that a non-scientist could follow the main points of his argument. At the same time, there is a beauty and elegance in his use of language:""... it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts... not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.""His humility. He openly admitted the weak points of his theory - in fact, there is an entire chapter entitled ""Difficulties on Theory."" In addition, he gave credit to other scientists for their contributions to both his and their own fields of research. And yet, he doesn't back down in the face of objections. Consider this emphatic statement concerning geologic time:""He who can read Sir Charles Lyell's grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future historian will recognize as having produced a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how incomprehensibly vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume."" The fact that Darwin reached his conclusions from observation and experiment before the birth of modern genetics is even more remarkable. His postulation  ...that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other... has certainly been proven true by modern DNA evidence.It goes without saying that a considerable amount of his work has been superseded with newer and more accurate findings. Mr. Darwin died before the development of the theories of continental drift and plate tectonics. While reading this, I couldn't help thinking how amazed he would be if he were able to see all of today's various fields of science, especially DNA research. ""The whole history of the world, as at present known, although of a length quite incomprehensible by us, will hereafter be recognized as a mere fragment of time, compared with the ages which have lapsed since the first creature, the progenitor of innnumerable extinct and living descendants, was created. In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches.""Now for the criticism. Mr. Darwin tends to repeat himself. Perhaps he did this on purpose to reiterate his position. I confess, I skimmed the final chapter titled ""Recapitulation and Conclusion."" Also, as has been often noted, Darwin was in a rush to publish and omitted quite a lot of data that supported his conclusions. As Thomas Henry Huxley said about The Origin of Species:...a sort of intellectual pemmican - a mass of facts crushed and pounded into shape, rather than held together by the ordinary medium of an obvious logical bond...Again, for sheer want of room, much has to be taken for granted which might readily enough be proved... the novice in biology is apt to complain of the frequency of what he fancies is gratuitous assumption .(Yet, in spite of those rather harsh words, Huxley was one of the most vocal and vehement supporters of Darwin's theory, becoming known as ""Darwin's Bulldog."")"

The Apollo guidance computer had less computing power than average modern family car. This is how we should view Darwin's 'Origin Of The Species'. It is an absolute triumph of empirical evidence based science. By the most constant and careful observation of the natural world Darwin not only worked out the theory of evolution he also quite correctly realised that all life forms on this planet are related to one another, ""by which all living and extinct beings are united by complex,radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand system""The first two chapters and the last chapter are where the general reader can feel the sparkle of Darwin's ideas and his profound infatuation with nature and its works. These chapters are also the best written and not surprisingly are a thrilling rush of theory and ideas.The vast bulk of the work is the minutiae of his ideas. It is, I have to say, cumbersome to read. It is the sort of sub clausal slog that a lot of nineteenth century writing gets bogged down in. Darwin's modesty in quoting and attributing to others and his unfailing scientific fearlessness in saying 'OK here is where my theory falls over' makes him a figure of unimpeachable scientific integrity.After reading this book I can understand the affection and respect that Darwin has been held in by those who try to base their lives in reason and science."

Definitely 5/5.Darwin's theory in a nutshell: Nature selects organisms with certain features (variations) to pass on their traits that help them survive (against competition – for food, shelter, mates – the environment and predators), forming different species (descendants with modification from a common ancestor) over many generations. Other factors that contribute to natural selection: diversification, living conditions, disuse of body parts. The species that can’t develop such traits eventually go extinct because nature keeps populations in balance (no population can grow forever, not even us: see Lovelock).Natural selection also modifies instincts (e.g. geometrically perfect beehives), and through variations in their reproductive systems why different species can’t procreate with one another (and if they do, their offspring is sterile)"

232,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,4,"Charles Darwin’s work has fanned out to round about every corner of the world, his work entrenched in every naturalist, scientist and biologist of our time, with his writings and findings written in almost every curriculum taught to undergraduate and postgraduate students studying life sciences. Which was my first encounter in Charles Darwin and all he and his work was about - Darwin’s finches, natural selection, evolution over time and his revolutionary voyage on the HMS Beagle was in just about every genetics module and evolution base modules I was taught. I’ve been encountering snippets of his work all throughout my studies, a quote here, an excerpt there and thought it was about time I go straight to the source and read On the Origin of Species. It’s such an original, a legend in its own right in its revolutionary reports and observations. I find it quite frankly amazing how much this amazing man deduced and discovered considering it was during a time when many of the scientific discoveries we have come to know now as common knowledge (like DNA) were unheard of back then. I’m glad I finally got round the reading the writings of the man who shaped our world in so many ways with the science he produced in this book. I feel like I can call myself a scientist and a science lover now that I’ve read these writings that’s at the heart of our genetics and evolutionary knowledge, providing the foundations to springboard into our current age of scientific enlightenment and discovery!"
233,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101139607-karoline,5,"The lesson we learn with Origin couldn’t be more devastating for our self-love as a species: under evolution’s lenses, our rationality is no more than an instinct that helps us survive. In the twenty-first century, this book should not be read for the science it. Darwin didn’t know mutations, he didn’t even know Mendel’s Laws! The important thing about this book is the change of world view it brought: we, humans, are not special! This story is not about us! In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us: we became self aware only to realize we are not protagonists. We are not on the top of the evolutionary scale, we are not more perfect than other living beings. This story began much before us and will probably end long after us. “Origin” helped us realize that.Darwin was a man ahead of his time, and I admire him greatly.Excellent read! "
234,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334545-david-s-t,3,"I figured while I was on my evolution book kick, I might as well go back to the original (well sort of the original, Alfred Russel Wallace published a paper on natural selection which prompted Darwin to publish this “abstract”). Now that I'm finished I feel two different ways about the book, a loved yet bored type of feeling. First I'm amazed at just how much of Darwin's theories and ideas are accurate and accepted even today 150 years later (which is a pretty darn long time in science). One thing you have to appreciate about this book is that its pretty evident that Darwin didn't just rush out and publish this theories but thought about every possible question everyone could have and he attempts to answer them all. Another question he spends a lot of time on is how flora could make it to islands, he goes through page after page of experiments trying to see how long seeds can stay in salt water and still germinate. Even better way back 150 years ago Darwin already anticipated the irreducible complexity argument of the eye and proposed his own ideas about how the eye could evolve and how each gradation is useful in itself. Some times the prose was pretty amazing, I think the famous line about “There is grandeur in this view of life.....” is one of my favorites in any book I've read.So as amazing as some parts where why then did I rate it 3 stars? Well for every amazing part there are page after page of material which is (to me) just plain boring. The prose which is great in sections is pretty tedious in other parts. The fact that he thought of every question means that he goes over proof after proof. Remember the salt water and the seeds mentioned above, well its cool at first but 40 pages of his experiments makes me start to care less and less. There were also a few parts which he got wrong, he spends a whole section trying to figure out why certain animals can't cross breed, something which is quickly addressed now days with DNA. I think at another part he denies that there ever were any mass extinctions (something we know happened several times in the earth's history). Another thing which made the book a little harder for me is Darwin mentions lots of people and animals I've never heard of, of course a better reader would have spend time looking them up but I just read on, I guess I didn't care enough to do that much research for the book. So overall for importance I'd rate this book a 5/5, but I have to factor in enjoyment and I so its gets the lower score. Truthfully this book is 150 years old and written in Victorian English, its very important, but there are better books on evolution out there, so if you're curious about the fascinating world of evolution, start elsewhere, only if you're curious about how the theory got started pick this one up.

235,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"I've probably listened to and rated over 15 books about evolution over the last two years, but I was always hesitant to read the granddaddy of them all. I should not have been and am glad I did for the following reasons,1) The book reads as well as any of the good popular science books available on audible. It is written as if his attended audience is for a 13 year old. That's how good of a writer Darwin is.2) I had obtained a google book version, but couldn't bring myself to read it, and I had obtained a free audio version floating around the net, but this audio version is professionally read and doesn't suffer at all from the narrator.3) The book lays out a very complicated argument in 13 basically independent chapters. Each chapter by itself is enough to convince the listener of the fact of evolution by natural selection. The author is very smooth at telling you what he's going to tell you, then tell you, and then explain to you what he has just told you.4) The book is a guidebook on how to lay out an argument and convince others to your viewpoint. He makes sure that he fairly presents criticism that could attack his theory and refutes it masterfully.5) My favorite reason for having read this book is that my smugness index has gone up. When I come across people who haven't read the book and deny the scientific fact of evolution I can now say that I have listened to the book and smugly add statements like ""even a thirteen year old can understand evolution, haven't you even read 'On the Origin of Species'""."
236,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13657916-jessi-roesner,4,"I'm rounding up a star or two for the experience of reading one of the most important books in history. In all honesty, this one was a challenge to get through at times -- often tedious in the sheer amount of detail, and the frequent repetition and reiteration of key arguments. I wish it had been about half as long, but I'm glad to be able to say I've read it. All that said, this book is a tour de force. The mark of a good theory is that it seems blatantly obvious in retrospect. I often had to remind myself what a revolutionary idea this was at the time, and yet the strength of Darwin's argument is overwhelming. The breadth and depth of his knowledge and research is also astonishing -- from talking about crossbreeds of plants I've never even heard of, to laying out the specific geological conditions under which fossils can be formed. It's hard to believe that he was able to lay out this theory well before the discovery of Mendelian inheritance (let alone DNA) and Pangea. The fact that he was able to come up with this elegant explanation of the origin of species without that knowledge, and still make such a compelling argument for it, is so impressive. ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."""

238,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,5,"Expectations high because of its reputation, I found the book slow-paced and quite boring. Not a word about human evolution! Darwin was no Dawkins in terms of wording and pacing, but this book led to a major paradigm shift in human thought. Its enormous impact cannot be disputed."
239,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51089-jamie,4,"To be completely honest, I wanted the notch on my belt for this one. Which didn’t hinder it from being interesting to read. No wonder Darwin set the world on edge in the most damning way possible, quietly and thoughtfully with these soft-spoken facts."
240,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"So this is the foundation of the theory of evolution. No, Darwin was not the first or only one with musings much like the ones described in this book, but he took some other people's theories (incl. that of his own grandfather) and took them further or perfected them.After having spent 5 years on the Beagle and thus seeing all kinds of places, Darwin had returned to England. It would be many years before he published this book but during the last stretch of the journey, Darwin had discovered something along some of the specimen he had collected on the Galápagos Islands. No, it was not his famous finches. Those he had forgotten (or not known) to label, thus no longer knowing which bird came from which of the islands. It was also not the famous tortoises as every single one of the ones taken on board the Beagle had been eaten and the shell been thrown overboard.Luckily, there were still the mockingbirds. And like all animals on the Galápagos, they too were different on every island and he HAD labelled them.Thus, he saw that while they were all mockingbirds, they had slight differences, especially when it came to their beaks, which gave him the idea of them being specialized to the life conditions on their respective island.It was also the Galápagos Islands that gave him the idea of volcanic activity birthing an island. He just didn't know about plate tectonics yet, sadly, as that theory was only established (and proven) about 100 years later.Thus, he talks of evolution as nature's way of selecting traits most suited for whatever life a creature lives. He talks about sexual selection and extinction of animals.Think back to those times: mankind thought themselves the master of the Earth, as God had willed it. God, the omnipotent being, had created all things. Evolution, therefore, was blasphemy as it meant God either at least changing his mind or having made mistakes. You can imagine how some people reacted once this book had been written and published.However, while reading this book, I was delighted to see that Darwin never bashed religious people but simply didn't talk about religion at all. Maybe he had learned not to broach the subject since he was married to a Catholic. *lol* Instead, he simply laid out his theory and his reasons for having established it, giving ample proof while listing the single steps. And whenever there was a gap, he would address it and explain why it was there, what the likely answer was and, again, why.I was astonished and more than pleased to see how he had written this book. Much like in his journal about the voyage on the Beagle, he shows a beautiful writing style and wrote this book not only for scholars but - and this was radical as well - for the layman to understand. A complex and new concept explained in a simple way to make the science accessible.Like when he talked about humans breeding dogs to be of a certain size and character traits or gardeners crossing different flowers to get certain petal shapes and colours.He took Humboldt's ""web of life"" and transformed it into his famous ""tree of life"". There were a few minor errors (we know now) but all in all, his logic was sound - only limited, sometimes, by some thing or other that hadn't yet been discovered or explained. My hardcover edition had beautiful illustrations. Some were Darwin's sketches, other were oil paintings of animals he was talking about in the book. However, much like with the other book, there is an audio version narrated by Dawkins that is really very good despite being abridged.Where humankind would be without Darwin and this book, I do not know. We owe Darwin and his work a lot, though, that's for sure."
241,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92443064-andra,0,"It is difficult to rate this, as Charles Darwin is evidently not a writer. His work and theories, however, I find genius."
242,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477945-kendall,5,"Finally re-read after decades of good intentions. For a recondite classic it is full of surprises, mostly pleasant; its supposed impenetrability largely confined to parts we already knew were directed at specialists—I admit to slogging through the section on barnacles, for example. But Origins is highly readable, pleasurable even, almost in the way of an Edmund Wilson essay. Darwin proceeds deliberately through the mountain of evidence he collected over twenty years as he constructs a virtually unassailable intellectual structure. Freely recognizing arguments against natural selection—the central thread of the book—he gives his best arguments based on the knowledge of his day while carefully pointing out its limitations. I was not prepared for how well he anticipated later discoveries—Mendel’s pioneering work in genetics didn’t see publication until the early 20th century yet dovetails almost seamlessly into Origins exposition, as does the Modern Synthesis. If you’re interested in any of the broad fields of biology-evolution, taxonomy, genetics—The Origin of Species is a must read. If you are a creationist, even in its deceptive guise of intelligent design, you are not intellectually honest if you have not read and honestly come to grips with this book; which gives the lie to the railings of a few misguided Christians and Muslims who seem to think it a product of their devil. Yet, so thoughtful and measured a book makes it clear any devils are in the eye of the beholder. "
243,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,4,"In reading The Origin of Species, one of the things I found myself respecting most about Charles Darwin was his aversion to dogma, religious or otherwise. He was generally logical, reasonable, and slow to jump to conclusions, and it seems to me that the enduring quality of this book owes much to these traits in its author. 
""From these and similar considerations, but chiefly from our ignorance of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United States; and from the revolution in our palæontological ideas on many points, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected, it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of organic beings throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its productions.""
"
244,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13229843-ben-batchelder,1,"Charles Darwin’s “The Origin of Species” promises a lot. A back cover blurb says, “Next to the Bible no work has been quite as influential....” I’m not a scientist, but with a build up like that I had to give it a try after enjoying “The Voyage of the Beagle” (reviewed 9/5/13).It is a slog of a read, yet Darwin’s enthusiasm for his subject, the excitement he conveys in outlining the work of his lifetime and popularizing a scientific movement, are palpable. Ironically, Darwin was not a scientist himself, but a “naturalist,” whose first job in the field – to be the Beagle’s naturalist-on-board – was a bit of a lark, suggested by friends, after his prior path to becoming an Anglican pastor (his father’s preference) came to naught.His insights – not entirely original, as he really consolidated lines of thinking going on for several generations – stemmed not only from his visit to the Galapagos Islands on the Beagle, but from observing man-driven selection in the breeding of domesticated animals.  I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man’s power of selection. But the expression...Survival of the Fittest is more accurate...” (p.61) Yet the problems start right away. As Creationist Kent Hovind has pointed out, the assumption that natural selection causes evolution is problematic, for “natural selection” never creates, it only selects. Furthermore, “survival of the fittest” is a tautology, for by definition the fit survive and the survivors are fit. As Hovind points out, natural selection might be more clearly called differential reproduction, that is, some reproduce more than others.And what drove Darwin to this line of thinking? It turns out he was a Malthusian, the Chicken Little of his time:It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them. (p. 63) The implication being, for some to live, others must die. Death, then, turns out to be the selection method of the Universe, in the never-ending struggle to survive. Or, as he succinctly states, “Thus, extinction and natural selection go hand in hand.” (p.161)Sensing how grim his outlook might appear, Darwin tries to pre-empt: When we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply. (p.75) Call it the theory of Happy Death then, one of many assertions that don’t ring true. No fear is felt? Death is generally prompt? Well, then, bring on more of this necessary (per Malthus) and creative force!Elevating nature to a Capitalized Power, Darwin characterizes it as less selfish than we: “Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends.” (p.79)Around this part of the book came the first of many mentions (that I noticed) of the phrase “scale of nature,” which of course is a direct descendent of Plato’s and Aristotle’s Scala Naturae, showing a direct link to the pagan concept of a hierarchy of development that was transformed into the the Great Chain of Being by the Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century. This pagan belief in a hierarcy of more and less developed beings may have influenced Darwin’s unfortunate choice of sub-title: “By Means of Natural Selection of the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.” It is difficult to find a modern edition of the book that hasn’t scrubbed clean this evidence of Darwin’s easy racism. (Only in my 150th Anniversary Edition, from Signet Classics in 2003, could I find the sub-title in any edition on-line – tucked away in a title page inside.) One can see why Darwin’s boosters try to re-write history, for the sub-title’s “favoured races” helps explain how Social Darwinism – only disavowed by evolution’s supporters after the horrors of WWII – created so much havoc in the 20th century. (Marx and Stalin were nominally Christian before reading Darwin; both Stalin and Hitler appropriated Darwin for their perverted, murderous philosophies.)In terms of other influences, Darwin often refers to Charles Lyell and his (literally) ground-breaking “Principles of Geology” which, by positing long geological ages, gave breathing room for Darwin’s theory of numerous “slight variations” to evolve, of minuscule improvements multiplied over unimaginably many iterations. He goes so far as to warn skeptical readers:	He who can read Sir Charles Lyell’s grand work on the Principles of Geology...and yet does not admit how vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume. (p. 316) If you are detecting a certain stridency, you are not alone.And what was it that excited Darwin so much to dedicate his life to? Simply stated, it is the mechanism by which modifications occur within a species in response to environmental pressures. The same way that man could take the primordial wolf and encourage endless variations into hundreds of dog breeds, so could evolution (in what we would call today, micro-evolution) encourage those famous finches of Galapagos Islands to vary in beak sizes in adaptation to micro-environments.But Darwin wishes to go much further than that. In fact, he seems to indulge in frequent straw man arguments, saying that “special creation” would have no explanation for the facts he marshals, as though his critics assert dogs could only have been independently created at the beginning of time.Perhaps something like this was the prevailing wisdom at the time – that no species, or what we might call sub-species today, could develop into another. Yet, to contemporary ears, he doth protest too much.In fact, he takes his valuable insights and then extrapolates them to incredible lengths. (The theory of evolution remains just that, a theory, rather than the supreme law as treated by so many moderns.) His animation takes wing with passages such as this:	It is a truly wonderful fact – the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity – that all animal and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other... (p. 126) After long dancing around the controversial bush of his own creation, by book’s end he admits, “I believe that animals are descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or less number.” (p.502) But even here he prevaricates, for in the book’s last paragraph he triumphs, “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator [Nature?] into a few forms or into one...” (p.507) So which is it? Four or five or just one “form”? Either way, now we are really talking about Macro Evolution!Yet, sadly, not one concrete example – that has then or since been confirmed as a proven fact – is given of one species evolving into a wholly new one. (In fact, from our more modern understanding of mutations and how DNA works, mutations never allow for a gain in information, only its loss, which makes evolving from the simple ameoba to the incredibly complex human being patently impossible, the stuff of pure fantasy.)To his credit, Darwin brings up (what were at the time) the objections most “fatal,” or potentially fatal, to his theory. One was related to the fossil record, the other to how evolution could possibly explain for extremely complex organs which would have been useless when only partially created and, under the logic of the theory, would have been eradicated by natural selection long before completion.Let’s take the critical area of fossil evidence, or complete lack of it. Darwin readily admits there should be countless examples of intermediary forms (for example, showing how a reptile grew wings to become a bird), and asks:	Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely-graduated organic chain, and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory. (p.314) The reason, he answers back in 1859, is “that the geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect” (p.327), that is, we hadn’t dug up enough fossils yet.Jump ahead over 150 years, with numberless excavations and bones found all over the world, and there are still no such fossils. While there have been numerous hoaxes, including Piltdown Man, Nebraska Man, an the Archaeoraptor, or “dino-bird” – such is modern man’s obsession with trying to prove evolution – the lack of fossil record is a real brain-twister for evolutionists. As Colin Patterson, the late senior paleotogologist of the British Museum of Natural History, admitted, “there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.” (1979 letter to Luther D. Sutherland, cited in his “Darwin’s Enigma: Ebbing the Tide of Naturalism,” 1988, p. 89)The other big strike against evolution, forwarded by Darwin himself, was the feasibility of countless small evolutionary steps creating a complex organ which is all but worthless until whole. 	To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberation, could have been formed by natural selection seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. (p.172) His stab at explaining away the problem, as absurd as those by current apoligists, such as Richard Dawkins, is to find the tiniest benefit from even 100th of an eye which, multiplied over eons, brings us the remarkable present. For, “if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though unsuperable by our imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory.” (p.172) So something “unsuperable by our imagination’ should not be subversive to the theory?							 Yet, to my layman’s eyes, Darwin makes relatively few such categorical errors. Although DNA’s molecular structure would only be discovered nearly a century after the book’s launch, he rightly conjectures the inter-relatedness of all life, saying “that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking...” (p.437) as “the one known cause of close similarity in organic beings...” (p.432). Yes, it turns out all organisms were created with the same basic genetic code or language, known today as DNA.But he takes his conjectures to overwrought degrees, using morphology (the study of form and structure of organic beings) to imply all animals descend from the same ancestor (or two) and embryology to claim our ancient forms are revealed in early embryonic development. Among the many hoaxes used to try to confirm Darwin’s work, embryology as proof of evolution has, perhaps, the longest legs. Remember the Intro Biology chart which shows how the earliest human fetus has fish-like “gill slits” which proves that among our ancestors are dead fish? Or the one which supposedly demonstrates how all vertebrates look nearly identical soon after conception? Despite the drawings, originally from one Ernst Haeckel in 1874, having over a century ago been revealed as fakes, they still grace many biology textbooks.Much has changed since Darwin’s book was published, so we shouldn’t be too harsh on the man. You have to wonder, though, if Darwin were alive today and realized that fossil evidence still did not exist, would he be consistent and admit he went too far? (Today’s evolutionists have tried to explain away the lack of fossil record with a new theory, called punctuated equilibrium, or vast periods of no change followed by sudden and great leaps – hence the scarcity of fossils – but Darwin himself argues against it. (p.187))Darwin also believed in only a simple structure at the atom level, facilitating the idea that man could evolve from, say, an ameoba. But DNA has proven the opposite, that the number of genes within one human body of over 100 trillion equals the number of stars in 1,000 galaxies (of 100 billion stars each). We also now know that in mutations, the supposed engine of evolution, information is always lost and never gained.Knowing what we know today, would Darwin still believe in Darwinism?While his excitement in synthesizing a ground-breaking theory is palpable, did Darwin really need to macro-itize the obvious truth (in retrospect) of micro-evolution? It makes you wonder if there can be too much of a good thing. I recently read a review in the Wall Street Journal titled “The Ship of the Imagination” while pondering Darwin’s work. Rather breathlessly, the reviewer exults, “[the author] tracks other scientific efforts to achieve the apparently miraculous, including mind reading, the search for immortality, love potions, and the creation of demi-gods – or at least superhumans.” (Michael Saler, WSJ, 12/18/15) Could too much imagination be a bad thing?Since Darwin, science has become increasingly untethered from ethical considerations. Interestingly, as Vishal Mangalwadi pointed out in his magisterial “The Book That Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization,” no major new scientific laws have been formulated since in the last century following this untethering.Arguably, what we have now is less science than Scientism, where flawed theories such as Darwin’s have to be treated as the Law of the Land. The same Colin Patterson mentioned above searched for evolutionists who, out of the public glare, would stand up for evolution as we understand it today. Revealingly, from several such encounters he wrote:	I’ve tried putting a simple question to various people and groups of people. Question is: Can you tell me anything you about evolution, any one thing, that is true? I tried that question on the geology staff at the Field Museum of Natural History and the only answer I got was silence. I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary Morphology Seminar in the University of Chicago, a very prestigious body of evolutionists, and all I got there was silence for a long time and eventually one person said, “I do know one thing – it ought not be taught in high school.” (Cited in Stephen Jones, “Evolutionsm and Creationsim,” 11/5/82, p.1) Could it be that Darwin succumbed, too, to the vanity of his own imagination? And for how much longer must we carry him aloft?"
245,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7366675-morgan,5,"A book that everyone talks about, but no one actually reads.Well people do read this book, but I have noticed when people talk about Darwin it doesn't seem like they read this book or ignored some important issues. This has nothing to do with religion and humans are more a footnote. This is a biology book mostly about animals and natural selection. While this book talks a little about evolution, that's not really why it's important. I think some reviews and people focus too much on the history of this book rather than what is actually in this book. If you don't pick up the fact that Darwin was hugely into birds and they helped his studies, reread this book again. Every chapter he talks about some kind of bird and relates it to the primary subject. The controversy seems to have started by one little part in this book, but it's his other book where he talks about humans. He ignored humans for the most part because of Malthus.While this is an important read, this book gets boring if you're not interested in zoology or biology. I've said this before but I had ducks for three years, so I'm very interested in animal studies. I didn't really want to read this book before only because I knew my past self would find this boring. Just know what your about to read instead of thinking everyone needs to read this before they die."
246,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I’m doing a biology degree, and I’ve always been an admirer of (and a believer in) the theory of evolution through natural selection, so it seemed high time I finally went to hear it from the horse’s mouth. Not that Darwin came up with the idea out of nothing, of course; it was “in the air” at the time, and other scientists were thinking along similar lines — Lamarck and Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, to name just two. Not to mention, of course, Alfred Wallace, who could’ve beaten Darwin to publication.But Charles Darwin was the first to publish a theory which really made sense, which hung together and was testable. He may not have known about genetics or had a clear idea of how heritability occurs, yet it’s startling to read this and realise how close he was to right at times. He may not always have backed the right theories, but he considered everything he could imagine, and carefully related it to his own theory. It’s remarkable just how willing he was to consider where his theory might be wrong, and discuss those weaknesses. It’s also remarkable how often he tested what he could, whether it be the germination of seeds soaked in sea water or how pollination works; he may not have had the equipment that we have now, but his attitude is surely a lesson that every aspiring scientist should take to heart.Honestly, I don’t know how anyone can read this and come away without understanding Darwin’s theory. He’s painstakingly clear, at length, with examples. If you’re reading this and coming to the conclusion that he didn’t support the idea of one species evolving into another, “macroevolution”, your reading comprehension is at fault. He makes it quite clear that “microevolution”, small changes in existing species, can and will lead to new species.Darwin was not right about everything, but he was right in many key ways — and he would be the first to admit that he could be wrong. He gave us a working, testable theory, one which has ample proof both in his work and in the world around us. Creationists have far too much to explain, by comparison.Originally reviewed for breathesbooks.com."

""The Origin of the Species"", presented here in its full first edition format (because the next 5 editions of it were just more in depth renderings on the same subjects, with some response to subsequent criticism added on top) does not include a single page, line or speculation on the origin of man. That, Darwin left for another book - you guessed it - ""The Descent of Man"". I've been meaning to read Origin for a long time, and have finally gotten around to it, expecting to be impressed and have my curiosity satisfied. I am and it was. I won't talk here about the writing itself, because it truly is just a long form scientific paper detailing experiments and hypotheses, trials and tribulations and the knowledge Darwin and others had on the subject. But I will say this: when you're reading it, bear something in mind. Think about the nuclear bomb-like quality this book had at the time it was published in intellectual circles everywhere. Think about how it shook and shattered the foundations of a Church which had been in power for around 1800 years at that point. Imagine the heretical nature it must have had (as it has today) in the eyes of indoctrinated people. And then think about how easy it is today for schools to refuse teaching evolution because ""it offends"" them, because it's not the truth they want. A few men - Darwin included - have dedicated their lives to a truth that even they didn't like and believe to begin with; they struggled with their own findings; they hated that they couldn't find evidence that would be more in line with their beliefs from childhood. But they never let that stop them. And they have given us the foundation for entire fields of science, from which we benefit from this day, whether we choose to accept it or not. I tried to read Origins with the mentality of a mid 19th Century and 2018 individual at the same time... it's awesome from both vantage points. "

Charles Darwin is the prophet of the natural selection theory and the Godfather of the struggle for survival.Darwin's work ""On The Origin of Species"" gives you a feel at times that you're reading something between a textbook and a book. This book is a short summary of his Voyage and 15 years of studying and researching organisms prior to writing this book. On the other hand, Darwin gives us an extensive detailed elaboration of his theory of evolution by means of natural selection.I wish he could have wrote more with regards to the humankind Species, but it was a different time, and writing this book was probably risky in itself.He was such a humble gentleman that he dedicated big portions of his book to the possible difficulties with his theory.I've read the Serbo-Croatian translation Postanak Vrsta autora Čarlsa Darvina / Akademska Knjiga 2009 6th Edition Publishing / 573 pages / 158,662 words."

It would have to be included on any short list of 'classics of science'. I have docked a star to reflect the fact that it's not always easy reading - there's that verbose quality to its style that characterizes most writing from the Victorian era. That said, I should point out that ""The Origin of Species"" is completely understandable to any general reader willing to give it a careful reading. You don't have to be a biologist to follow Darwin's argument. Two aspects of the book are astonishing; both underscore the brilliance of Darwin's accomplishment. The first is just how right he got things; the second is that he managed to fit all the major pieces of the puzzle in place with no knowledge of the actual mechanics of heredity. Mendel's work on genetics adn the elucidation of the structure of DNA would subsequently flesh out the details of the scheme proposed by Darwin; one has to bear in mind the actual state of knowledge in Darwin's time, and the prevailing intellectual climate, to appreciate fully the revolutionary nature of his argument. Upon re-reading the book this past weekend, I was reminded of certain endearing aspects that I had forgotten. One is Darwin's willingness to point out, and try to answer, what he perceived as the potential weaknesses in his argument. This is another: ""Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have, after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons"". Not quite as glamorous as the beasties he got to see from The Beagle, but he's continually observing, gathering data from any source available, always asking questions. You gotta love this book. But you gotta read it to love it. "
250,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33352366-elari,5,"As I was going through the Origin of Species page on Goodreads, I decided to check some of the one-star reviews. What I mainly found was:a) Creationists who didn’t read the book, but nonetheless needed to assert that humans are not descended from apes.b) Confused readers complaining about some obnoxious character called Alex. Since it was improbable that Darwin had given pet names to any creature whether living or fossilized, I looked into this one further and realized that a rather bad Nino Ricci novel was merged with Darwin’s science book. What a shame, Goodreads.c) Other confused readers who decided to give Darwin a one-star rating because of Ray Comfort’s introduction, which I think is utterly unfair to Darwin, although utterly fair to Comfort. Bash - Creationism Suite No.1 - PreludeThe edition I first started reading has a certain Ray Comfort gift us a very Special Introduction. This Mister – who also turns out to be a Christian Minister – desperately struggles to install the idea of a supreme being into Darwin’s theory before the latter gets a chance to speak. Mister Comfort Zone elaborates on moronic arguments that would make God himself flush with embarrassment, only to arrive at the conclusion that the complexity of life as we know it could not have evolved by chance (synonymous with eco-biochemistry in the creationist dialect). The conclusion of the book’s introduction, then, unlike the conclusion of the book itself, is that The Origin of Species is intelligent design.I’m surprised that decontextualizing quotes from prominent scientists to make them fit into the Comfort Combat is not considered an intellectual property infringement. The fact that this edition made it to print instead of court is very telling. For its disgraceful attempt at spoiling a science book with bad writing, the introduction deserves no stars at all. It’s almost a shame that it isn’t featured on GoodReads separately, but I won’t give Darwin’s book a low rating on its account. I’ll just pick another edition. The Origin of SpeciesReading On The Origin of Species isn’t about being introduced to a theory you know nothing about. Anyone remotely interested in evolution will reach this book as the culmination of a long winding road of scientific discoveries. It is still a priceless read, because of the quality of research and of its presentation. I have yet to find a work of art as beautiful as this science book.Darwin isn’t humorous in his writing. He is grave, patient, and humble. He is, beyond any doubt, the most modest of all the scientists I have ever met or read. Consider this: “To arrive at a just conclusion regarding the formation of the eye, with all its marvelous but not absolutely perfect characters, it is indispensable that the reason should conquer the imagination; but I have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at others hesitating to extend the principle of natural selection to so startling a length.” Moreover, he is so meticulous and precise that my sapient brain could die of fulfillment. Every tiny detail attended to—and there are so many—makes the whole of my intelligence appear tinier and tinier. It is most incredible that Darwin had to rely on empirical data, having no access to (and indeed no knowledge of) the genetic material, the basis of hereditable mutations. This intuition is beyond my comprehension. How could one man foresee such an immense and intricate scheme of things despite the widely accepted, unquestionable doctrines of his time?Compulsory Postscript: Tim Minchin on Americans and Evolution."

After reading it, I whole-heartedly agree with the statement. Only when one reads Darwin's perspective on such topics as breeding, domestic speciation, migration, instinct, etc. does one come to fully realize how much this book ushered in a new age of modern thought. The Theory of Evolution is so pervasive in the mindset of today's world that only by reading the work can one understand how much of a statement Darwin was making by risking its publication. He very literally changed the world or, rather, told us how it had been changed.Within the book Darwin also makes many references to the ""beauty"" and ""wonder"" of nature, something that I found quite fascinating considering how many (or at least some) believe his works to be the antithesis of religious ideals. I gained a respect for Darwin's knowledge and love for the natural world that surrounds us, and there is no question that his words caused me to appreciate nature in both a scientific and spiritual sense. As my opening quote demonstrates, you owe it to yourself to read this book. It changed the way mankind viewed the planet, their relationship with it and, indeed, their relationship with their very origins. ""There is grandeur in this view of life..."""

A banned book.I can't rate this book honestly because I tend to rate books based on my feelings and I just can't rate this fundamental for science book the one star my feelings demand. Because reading this is pure torture. I've studied Dawrin's theory so I was interested in the way he came up to those conclusions. I was pretty surprised that he even managed to do it considering how much he didn't know back then. But the way the book was written... I won't lie it's a great sleeping aid. The repetitions and multiple examples for the same thing must have been crucial for convincing people back then but made me scream. I hate evolutionary genetics because for some reason I find it extremely boring. Still this is one of the pillars of today's biology so as a biologist I had to read it. But if you want to actually learn about Darwin's theory go find a biology textbook - it's explained much better. Or rather it's explained without all the boring details.

However, in the last chapter, he takes his time to briefly explain to us everything he has taught us during his works, in order to makes us perceive the wonderful struggle for existence surrounding us.The book makes you feel something like ""you deserve to be amazing, because life took such a contrivance to conceive you""."

You will want to jump to the Introduction, itself pretty turgid:""Indefinite variability is a much more common result of changed conditions than definite variability, and has probably played a more important part in the formation of our domestic races. We see indefinite variability in the endless slight peculiarities which distinguish the individuals of the same species, and which cannot be accounted for by inheritance from either parent or from some more remote ancestor."" OK, then! On to Chap. 1: ""When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of character than in true species. Domestic races often have a somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although differing from each other and from other species of the same genus, in several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part..."" Less turgid, but still pretty tough sledding, at least for me. Trying Chap 2: ""I am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the cases of variability, even in important parts of structure, which he could collect on good authority, as I have collected, during a course of years. It should be remembered that systematists are far from being pleased at finding variability in important characters, and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs, and compare them in many specimens of the same species.""OK.

Darwin was unusually reflexive and tempered in his writing, probably owing at least in part to the heavy disapproval he know he would encounter from everyone from the clergy to other scientists, but props to him for writing in a way that is at once confident and humble. Reading this after Feyerabend's Against Method, the major thing I took away from it was that science should always leave itself open to the consideration of new theories, even if those theories contradict the logical systems that presently reign. In the case of Darwin, it is utterly apparent (to me) that Natural Selection is an ethical and valuable creation myth that opens the field of scientific inquiry to an untold number of fresh possibilities. That it was abused by so-called social Darwinists and other politically motivated actors only reinforces my feeling that the ethical implications of all scientific theory should be subjected to at least as much rigor as data, methodology, and repeatability.Finally, Darwin uses awesome examples of strange animals."

But even from a strictly layperson's view, there are a number of things about The Origin of Species that greatly impressed me.His careful observations. It is obvious that he cared deeply about his work. He had made careful observations and comparisons about many species, both plants and animals. It is quite clear that he passionately loved nature.""He must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a [honey]comb, so beautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration.His elegant use of language. While the target audience of The Origin was his fellow scientists, he wrote clearly and plainly enough that a non-scientist could follow the main points of his argument. At the same time, there is a beauty and elegance in his use of language:""... it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts... not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.""His humility. He openly admitted the weak points of his theory - in fact, there is an entire chapter entitled ""Difficulties on Theory."" In addition, he gave credit to other scientists for their contributions to both his and their own fields of research. And yet, he doesn't back down in the face of objections. Consider this emphatic statement concerning geologic time:""He who can read Sir Charles Lyell's grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future historian will recognize as having produced a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how incomprehensibly vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume."" The fact that Darwin reached his conclusions from observation and experiment before the birth of modern genetics is even more remarkable. His postulation  ...that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other... has certainly been proven true by modern DNA evidence.It goes without saying that a considerable amount of his work has been superseded with newer and more accurate findings. Mr. Darwin died before the development of the theories of continental drift and plate tectonics. While reading this, I couldn't help thinking how amazed he would be if he were able to see all of today's various fields of science, especially DNA research. ""The whole history of the world, as at present known, although of a length quite incomprehensible by us, will hereafter be recognized as a mere fragment of time, compared with the ages which have lapsed since the first creature, the progenitor of innnumerable extinct and living descendants, was created. In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches.""Now for the criticism. Mr. Darwin tends to repeat himself. Perhaps he did this on purpose to reiterate his position. I confess, I skimmed the final chapter titled ""Recapitulation and Conclusion."" Also, as has been often noted, Darwin was in a rush to publish and omitted quite a lot of data that supported his conclusions. As Thomas Henry Huxley said about The Origin of Species:...a sort of intellectual pemmican - a mass of facts crushed and pounded into shape, rather than held together by the ordinary medium of an obvious logical bond...Again, for sheer want of room, much has to be taken for granted which might readily enough be proved... the novice in biology is apt to complain of the frequency of what he fancies is gratuitous assumption .(Yet, in spite of those rather harsh words, Huxley was one of the most vocal and vehement supporters of Darwin's theory, becoming known as ""Darwin's Bulldog."")"

The Apollo guidance computer had less computing power than average modern family car. This is how we should view Darwin's 'Origin Of The Species'. It is an absolute triumph of empirical evidence based science. By the most constant and careful observation of the natural world Darwin not only worked out the theory of evolution he also quite correctly realised that all life forms on this planet are related to one another, ""by which all living and extinct beings are united by complex,radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand system""The first two chapters and the last chapter are where the general reader can feel the sparkle of Darwin's ideas and his profound infatuation with nature and its works. These chapters are also the best written and not surprisingly are a thrilling rush of theory and ideas.The vast bulk of the work is the minutiae of his ideas. It is, I have to say, cumbersome to read. It is the sort of sub clausal slog that a lot of nineteenth century writing gets bogged down in. Darwin's modesty in quoting and attributing to others and his unfailing scientific fearlessness in saying 'OK here is where my theory falls over' makes him a figure of unimpeachable scientific integrity.After reading this book I can understand the affection and respect that Darwin has been held in by those who try to base their lives in reason and science."

Definitely 5/5.Darwin's theory in a nutshell: Nature selects organisms with certain features (variations) to pass on their traits that help them survive (against competition – for food, shelter, mates – the environment and predators), forming different species (descendants with modification from a common ancestor) over many generations. Other factors that contribute to natural selection: diversification, living conditions, disuse of body parts. The species that can’t develop such traits eventually go extinct because nature keeps populations in balance (no population can grow forever, not even us: see Lovelock).Natural selection also modifies instincts (e.g. geometrically perfect beehives), and through variations in their reproductive systems why different species can’t procreate with one another (and if they do, their offspring is sterile)"

Which was my first encounter in Charles Darwin and all he and his work was about - Darwin’s finches, natural selection, evolution over time and his revolutionary voyage on the HMS Beagle was in just about every genetics module and evolution base modules I was taught. I’ve been encountering snippets of his work all throughout my studies, a quote here, an excerpt there and thought it was about time I go straight to the source and read On the Origin of Species. It’s such an original, a legend in its own right in its revolutionary reports and observations. I find it quite frankly amazing how much this amazing man deduced and discovered considering it was during a time when many of the scientific discoveries we have come to know now as common knowledge (like DNA) were unheard of back then. I’m glad I finally got round the reading the writings of the man who shaped our world in so many ways with the science he produced in this book.

In the twenty-first century, this book should not be read for the science it. Darwin didn’t know mutations, he didn’t even know Mendel’s Laws! The important thing about this book is the change of world view it brought: we, humans, are not special! This story is not about us! In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us: we became self aware only to realize we are not protagonists. We are not on the top of the evolutionary scale, we are not more perfect than other living beings. This story began much before us and will probably end long after us. “Origin” helped us realize that.Darwin was a man ahead of his time, and I admire him greatly.Excellent read! "
264,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334545-david-s-t,3,"I figured while I was on my evolution book kick, I might as well go back to the original (well sort of the original, Alfred Russel Wallace published a paper on natural selection which prompted Darwin to publish this “abstract”). Now that I'm finished I feel two different ways about the book, a loved yet bored type of feeling. First I'm amazed at just how much of Darwin's theories and ideas are accurate and accepted even today 150 years later (which is a pretty darn long time in science). One thing you have to appreciate about this book is that its pretty evident that Darwin didn't just rush out and publish this theories but thought about every possible question everyone could have and he attempts to answer them all. Another question he spends a lot of time on is how flora could make it to islands, he goes through page after page of experiments trying to see how long seeds can stay in salt water and still germinate. Even better way back 150 years ago Darwin already anticipated the irreducible complexity argument of the eye and proposed his own ideas about how the eye could evolve and how each gradation is useful in itself. Some times the prose was pretty amazing, I think the famous line about “There is grandeur in this view of life.....” is one of my favorites in any book I've read.So as amazing as some parts where why then did I rate it 3 stars? Well for every amazing part there are page after page of material which is (to me) just plain boring. The prose which is great in sections is pretty tedious in other parts. The fact that he thought of every question means that he goes over proof after proof. Remember the salt water and the seeds mentioned above, well its cool at first but 40 pages of his experiments makes me start to care less and less. There were also a few parts which he got wrong, he spends a whole section trying to figure out why certain animals can't cross breed, something which is quickly addressed now days with DNA. I think at another part he denies that there ever were any mass extinctions (something we know happened several times in the earth's history). Another thing which made the book a little harder for me is Darwin mentions lots of people and animals I've never heard of, of course a better reader would have spend time looking them up but I just read on, I guess I didn't care enough to do that much research for the book. So overall for importance I'd rate this book a 5/5, but I have to factor in enjoyment and I so its gets the lower score. Truthfully this book is 150 years old and written in Victorian English, its very important, but there are better books on evolution out there, so if you're curious about the fascinating world of evolution, start elsewhere, only if you're curious about how the theory got started pick this one up.

I should not have been and am glad I did for the following reasons,1) The book reads as well as any of the good popular science books available on audible. It is written as if his attended audience is for a 13 year old. That's how good of a writer Darwin is.2) I had obtained a google book version, but couldn't bring myself to read it, and I had obtained a free audio version floating around the net, but this audio version is professionally read and doesn't suffer at all from the narrator.3) The book lays out a very complicated argument in 13 basically independent chapters. Each chapter by itself is enough to convince the listener of the fact of evolution by natural selection. The author is very smooth at telling you what he's going to tell you, then tell you, and then explain to you what he has just told you.4) The book is a guidebook on how to lay out an argument and convince others to your viewpoint. He makes sure that he fairly presents criticism that could attack his theory and refutes it masterfully.5) My favorite reason for having read this book is that my smugness index has gone up. When I come across people who haven't read the book and deny the scientific fact of evolution I can now say that I have listened to the book and smugly add statements like ""even a thirteen year old can understand evolution, haven't you even read 'On the Origin of Species'""."

In all honesty, this one was a challenge to get through at times -- often tedious in the sheer amount of detail, and the frequent repetition and reiteration of key arguments. I wish it had been about half as long, but I'm glad to be able to say I've read it. All that said, this book is a tour de force. The mark of a good theory is that it seems blatantly obvious in retrospect. I often had to remind myself what a revolutionary idea this was at the time, and yet the strength of Darwin's argument is overwhelming. The breadth and depth of his knowledge and research is also astonishing -- from talking about crossbreeds of plants I've never even heard of, to laying out the specific geological conditions under which fossils can be formed. It's hard to believe that he was able to lay out this theory well before the discovery of Mendelian inheritance (let alone DNA) and Pangea. The fact that he was able to come up with this elegant explanation of the origin of species without that knowledge, and still make such a compelling argument for it, is so impressive. ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."""

It's actually surprisingly well written, with doses of wry humor here and there. But it's main strength is just the insight into a brilliant mind at work. There can be no better lesson for someone intersted in a career in science."

Darwin was no Dawkins in terms of wording and pacing, but this book led to a major paradigm shift in human thought. Its enormous impact cannot be disputed."
269,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51089-jamie,4,"To be completely honest, I wanted the notch on my belt for this one. Which didn’t hinder it from being interesting to read. No wonder Darwin set the world on edge in the most damning way possible, quietly and thoughtfully with these soft-spoken facts."
270,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"So this is the foundation of the theory of evolution. No, Darwin was not the first or only one with musings much like the ones described in this book, but he took some other people's theories (incl. that of his own grandfather) and took them further or perfected them.After having spent 5 years on the Beagle and thus seeing all kinds of places, Darwin had returned to England. It would be many years before he published this book but during the last stretch of the journey, Darwin had discovered something along some of the specimen he had collected on the Galápagos Islands. No, it was not his famous finches. Those he had forgotten (or not known) to label, thus no longer knowing which bird came from which of the islands. It was also not the famous tortoises as every single one of the ones taken on board the Beagle had been eaten and the shell been thrown overboard.Luckily, there were still the mockingbirds. And like all animals on the Galápagos, they too were different on every island and he HAD labelled them.Thus, he saw that while they were all mockingbirds, they had slight differences, especially when it came to their beaks, which gave him the idea of them being specialized to the life conditions on their respective island.It was also the Galápagos Islands that gave him the idea of volcanic activity birthing an island. He just didn't know about plate tectonics yet, sadly, as that theory was only established (and proven) about 100 years later.Thus, he talks of evolution as nature's way of selecting traits most suited for whatever life a creature lives. He talks about sexual selection and extinction of animals.Think back to those times: mankind thought themselves the master of the Earth, as God had willed it. God, the omnipotent being, had created all things. Evolution, therefore, was blasphemy as it meant God either at least changing his mind or having made mistakes. You can imagine how some people reacted once this book had been written and published.However, while reading this book, I was delighted to see that Darwin never bashed religious people but simply didn't talk about religion at all. Maybe he had learned not to broach the subject since he was married to a Catholic. *lol* Instead, he simply laid out his theory and his reasons for having established it, giving ample proof while listing the single steps. And whenever there was a gap, he would address it and explain why it was there, what the likely answer was and, again, why.I was astonished and more than pleased to see how he had written this book. Much like in his journal about the voyage on the Beagle, he shows a beautiful writing style and wrote this book not only for scholars but - and this was radical as well - for the layman to understand. A complex and new concept explained in a simple way to make the science accessible.Like when he talked about humans breeding dogs to be of a certain size and character traits or gardeners crossing different flowers to get certain petal shapes and colours.He took Humboldt's ""web of life"" and transformed it into his famous ""tree of life"". There were a few minor errors (we know now) but all in all, his logic was sound - only limited, sometimes, by some thing or other that hadn't yet been discovered or explained. My hardcover edition had beautiful illustrations. Some were Darwin's sketches, other were oil paintings of animals he was talking about in the book. However, much like with the other book, there is an audio version narrated by Dawkins that is really very good despite being abridged.Where humankind would be without Darwin and this book, I do not know. We owe Darwin and his work a lot, though, that's for sure."
271,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92443064-andra,0,"It is difficult to rate this, as Charles Darwin is evidently not a writer. His work and theories, however, I find genius."
272,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477945-kendall,5,"Finally re-read after decades of good intentions. For a recondite classic it is full of surprises, mostly pleasant; its supposed impenetrability largely confined to parts we already knew were directed at specialists—I admit to slogging through the section on barnacles, for example. But Origins is highly readable, pleasurable even, almost in the way of an Edmund Wilson essay. Darwin proceeds deliberately through the mountain of evidence he collected over twenty years as he constructs a virtually unassailable intellectual structure. Freely recognizing arguments against natural selection—the central thread of the book—he gives his best arguments based on the knowledge of his day while carefully pointing out its limitations. I was not prepared for how well he anticipated later discoveries—Mendel’s pioneering work in genetics didn’t see publication until the early 20th century yet dovetails almost seamlessly into Origins exposition, as does the Modern Synthesis. If you’re interested in any of the broad fields of biology-evolution, taxonomy, genetics—The Origin of Species is a must read. If you are a creationist, even in its deceptive guise of intelligent design, you are not intellectually honest if you have not read and honestly come to grips with this book; which gives the lie to the railings of a few misguided Christians and Muslims who seem to think it a product of their devil. Yet, so thoughtful and measured a book makes it clear any devils are in the eye of the beholder. "
273,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,4,"In reading The Origin of Species, one of the things I found myself respecting most about Charles Darwin was his aversion to dogma, religious or otherwise. He was generally logical, reasonable, and slow to jump to conclusions, and it seems to me that the enduring quality of this book owes much to these traits in its author. 
""From these and similar considerations, but chiefly from our ignorance of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United States; and from the revolution in our palæontological ideas on many points, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected, it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of organic beings throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its productions.""
"
274,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13229843-ben-batchelder,1,"Charles Darwin’s “The Origin of Species” promises a lot. A back cover blurb says, “Next to the Bible no work has been quite as influential....” I’m not a scientist, but with a build up like that I had to give it a try after enjoying “The Voyage of the Beagle” (reviewed 9/5/13).It is a slog of a read, yet Darwin’s enthusiasm for his subject, the excitement he conveys in outlining the work of his lifetime and popularizing a scientific movement, are palpable. Ironically, Darwin was not a scientist himself, but a “naturalist,” whose first job in the field – to be the Beagle’s naturalist-on-board – was a bit of a lark, suggested by friends, after his prior path to becoming an Anglican pastor (his father’s preference) came to naught.His insights – not entirely original, as he really consolidated lines of thinking going on for several generations – stemmed not only from his visit to the Galapagos Islands on the Beagle, but from observing man-driven selection in the breeding of domesticated animals.  I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man’s power of selection. But the expression...Survival of the Fittest is more accurate...” (p.61) Yet the problems start right away. As Creationist Kent Hovind has pointed out, the assumption that natural selection causes evolution is problematic, for “natural selection” never creates, it only selects. Furthermore, “survival of the fittest” is a tautology, for by definition the fit survive and the survivors are fit. As Hovind points out, natural selection might be more clearly called differential reproduction, that is, some reproduce more than others.And what drove Darwin to this line of thinking? It turns out he was a Malthusian, the Chicken Little of his time:It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them. (p. 63) The implication being, for some to live, others must die. Death, then, turns out to be the selection method of the Universe, in the never-ending struggle to survive. Or, as he succinctly states, “Thus, extinction and natural selection go hand in hand.” (p.161)Sensing how grim his outlook might appear, Darwin tries to pre-empt: When we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply. (p.75) Call it the theory of Happy Death then, one of many assertions that don’t ring true. No fear is felt? Death is generally prompt? Well, then, bring on more of this necessary (per Malthus) and creative force!Elevating nature to a Capitalized Power, Darwin characterizes it as less selfish than we: “Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends.” (p.79)Around this part of the book came the first of many mentions (that I noticed) of the phrase “scale of nature,” which of course is a direct descendent of Plato’s and Aristotle’s Scala Naturae, showing a direct link to the pagan concept of a hierarchy of development that was transformed into the the Great Chain of Being by the Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century. This pagan belief in a hierarcy of more and less developed beings may have influenced Darwin’s unfortunate choice of sub-title: “By Means of Natural Selection of the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.” It is difficult to find a modern edition of the book that hasn’t scrubbed clean this evidence of Darwin’s easy racism. (Only in my 150th Anniversary Edition, from Signet Classics in 2003, could I find the sub-title in any edition on-line – tucked away in a title page inside.) One can see why Darwin’s boosters try to re-write history, for the sub-title’s “favoured races” helps explain how Social Darwinism – only disavowed by evolution’s supporters after the horrors of WWII – created so much havoc in the 20th century. (Marx and Stalin were nominally Christian before reading Darwin; both Stalin and Hitler appropriated Darwin for their perverted, murderous philosophies.)In terms of other influences, Darwin often refers to Charles Lyell and his (literally) ground-breaking “Principles of Geology” which, by positing long geological ages, gave breathing room for Darwin’s theory of numerous “slight variations” to evolve, of minuscule improvements multiplied over unimaginably many iterations. He goes so far as to warn skeptical readers:	He who can read Sir Charles Lyell’s grand work on the Principles of Geology...and yet does not admit how vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume. (p. 316) If you are detecting a certain stridency, you are not alone.And what was it that excited Darwin so much to dedicate his life to? Simply stated, it is the mechanism by which modifications occur within a species in response to environmental pressures. The same way that man could take the primordial wolf and encourage endless variations into hundreds of dog breeds, so could evolution (in what we would call today, micro-evolution) encourage those famous finches of Galapagos Islands to vary in beak sizes in adaptation to micro-environments.But Darwin wishes to go much further than that. In fact, he seems to indulge in frequent straw man arguments, saying that “special creation” would have no explanation for the facts he marshals, as though his critics assert dogs could only have been independently created at the beginning of time.Perhaps something like this was the prevailing wisdom at the time – that no species, or what we might call sub-species today, could develop into another. Yet, to contemporary ears, he doth protest too much.In fact, he takes his valuable insights and then extrapolates them to incredible lengths. (The theory of evolution remains just that, a theory, rather than the supreme law as treated by so many moderns.) His animation takes wing with passages such as this:	It is a truly wonderful fact – the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity – that all animal and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other... (p. 126) After long dancing around the controversial bush of his own creation, by book’s end he admits, “I believe that animals are descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or less number.” (p.502) But even here he prevaricates, for in the book’s last paragraph he triumphs, “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator [Nature?] into a few forms or into one...” (p.507) So which is it? Four or five or just one “form”? Either way, now we are really talking about Macro Evolution!Yet, sadly, not one concrete example – that has then or since been confirmed as a proven fact – is given of one species evolving into a wholly new one. (In fact, from our more modern understanding of mutations and how DNA works, mutations never allow for a gain in information, only its loss, which makes evolving from the simple ameoba to the incredibly complex human being patently impossible, the stuff of pure fantasy.)To his credit, Darwin brings up (what were at the time) the objections most “fatal,” or potentially fatal, to his theory. One was related to the fossil record, the other to how evolution could possibly explain for extremely complex organs which would have been useless when only partially created and, under the logic of the theory, would have been eradicated by natural selection long before completion.Let’s take the critical area of fossil evidence, or complete lack of it. Darwin readily admits there should be countless examples of intermediary forms (for example, showing how a reptile grew wings to become a bird), and asks:	Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely-graduated organic chain, and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory. (p.314) The reason, he answers back in 1859, is “that the geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect” (p.327), that is, we hadn’t dug up enough fossils yet.Jump ahead over 150 years, with numberless excavations and bones found all over the world, and there are still no such fossils. While there have been numerous hoaxes, including Piltdown Man, Nebraska Man, an the Archaeoraptor, or “dino-bird” – such is modern man’s obsession with trying to prove evolution – the lack of fossil record is a real brain-twister for evolutionists. As Colin Patterson, the late senior paleotogologist of the British Museum of Natural History, admitted, “there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.” (1979 letter to Luther D. Sutherland, cited in his “Darwin’s Enigma: Ebbing the Tide of Naturalism,” 1988, p. 89)The other big strike against evolution, forwarded by Darwin himself, was the feasibility of countless small evolutionary steps creating a complex organ which is all but worthless until whole. 	To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberation, could have been formed by natural selection seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. (p.172) His stab at explaining away the problem, as absurd as those by current apoligists, such as Richard Dawkins, is to find the tiniest benefit from even 100th of an eye which, multiplied over eons, brings us the remarkable present. For, “if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though unsuperable by our imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory.” (p.172) So something “unsuperable by our imagination’ should not be subversive to the theory?							 Yet, to my layman’s eyes, Darwin makes relatively few such categorical errors. Although DNA’s molecular structure would only be discovered nearly a century after the book’s launch, he rightly conjectures the inter-relatedness of all life, saying “that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking...” (p.437) as “the one known cause of close similarity in organic beings...” (p.432). Yes, it turns out all organisms were created with the same basic genetic code or language, known today as DNA.But he takes his conjectures to overwrought degrees, using morphology (the study of form and structure of organic beings) to imply all animals descend from the same ancestor (or two) and embryology to claim our ancient forms are revealed in early embryonic development. Among the many hoaxes used to try to confirm Darwin’s work, embryology as proof of evolution has, perhaps, the longest legs. Remember the Intro Biology chart which shows how the earliest human fetus has fish-like “gill slits” which proves that among our ancestors are dead fish? Or the one which supposedly demonstrates how all vertebrates look nearly identical soon after conception? Despite the drawings, originally from one Ernst Haeckel in 1874, having over a century ago been revealed as fakes, they still grace many biology textbooks.Much has changed since Darwin’s book was published, so we shouldn’t be too harsh on the man. You have to wonder, though, if Darwin were alive today and realized that fossil evidence still did not exist, would he be consistent and admit he went too far? (Today’s evolutionists have tried to explain away the lack of fossil record with a new theory, called punctuated equilibrium, or vast periods of no change followed by sudden and great leaps – hence the scarcity of fossils – but Darwin himself argues against it. (p.187))Darwin also believed in only a simple structure at the atom level, facilitating the idea that man could evolve from, say, an ameoba. But DNA has proven the opposite, that the number of genes within one human body of over 100 trillion equals the number of stars in 1,000 galaxies (of 100 billion stars each). We also now know that in mutations, the supposed engine of evolution, information is always lost and never gained.Knowing what we know today, would Darwin still believe in Darwinism?While his excitement in synthesizing a ground-breaking theory is palpable, did Darwin really need to macro-itize the obvious truth (in retrospect) of micro-evolution? It makes you wonder if there can be too much of a good thing. I recently read a review in the Wall Street Journal titled “The Ship of the Imagination” while pondering Darwin’s work. Rather breathlessly, the reviewer exults, “[the author] tracks other scientific efforts to achieve the apparently miraculous, including mind reading, the search for immortality, love potions, and the creation of demi-gods – or at least superhumans.” (Michael Saler, WSJ, 12/18/15) Could too much imagination be a bad thing?Since Darwin, science has become increasingly untethered from ethical considerations. Interestingly, as Vishal Mangalwadi pointed out in his magisterial “The Book That Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization,” no major new scientific laws have been formulated since in the last century following this untethering.Arguably, what we have now is less science than Scientism, where flawed theories such as Darwin’s have to be treated as the Law of the Land. The same Colin Patterson mentioned above searched for evolutionists who, out of the public glare, would stand up for evolution as we understand it today. Revealingly, from several such encounters he wrote:	I’ve tried putting a simple question to various people and groups of people. Question is: Can you tell me anything you about evolution, any one thing, that is true? I tried that question on the geology staff at the Field Museum of Natural History and the only answer I got was silence. I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary Morphology Seminar in the University of Chicago, a very prestigious body of evolutionists, and all I got there was silence for a long time and eventually one person said, “I do know one thing – it ought not be taught in high school.” (Cited in Stephen Jones, “Evolutionsm and Creationsim,” 11/5/82, p.1) Could it be that Darwin succumbed, too, to the vanity of his own imagination? And for how much longer must we carry him aloft?"
275,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7366675-morgan,5,"A book that everyone talks about, but no one actually reads.Well people do read this book, but I have noticed when people talk about Darwin it doesn't seem like they read this book or ignored some important issues. This has nothing to do with religion and humans are more a footnote. This is a biology book mostly about animals and natural selection. While this book talks a little about evolution, that's not really why it's important. I think some reviews and people focus too much on the history of this book rather than what is actually in this book. If you don't pick up the fact that Darwin was hugely into birds and they helped his studies, reread this book again. Every chapter he talks about some kind of bird and relates it to the primary subject. The controversy seems to have started by one little part in this book, but it's his other book where he talks about humans. He ignored humans for the most part because of Malthus.While this is an important read, this book gets boring if you're not interested in zoology or biology. I've said this before but I had ducks for three years, so I'm very interested in animal studies. I didn't really want to read this book before only because I knew my past self would find this boring. Just know what your about to read instead of thinking everyone needs to read this before they die."
276,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I’m doing a biology degree, and I’ve always been an admirer of (and a believer in) the theory of evolution through natural selection, so it seemed high time I finally went to hear it from the horse’s mouth. Not that Darwin came up with the idea out of nothing, of course; it was “in the air” at the time, and other scientists were thinking along similar lines — Lamarck and Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, to name just two. Not to mention, of course, Alfred Wallace, who could’ve beaten Darwin to publication.But Charles Darwin was the first to publish a theory which really made sense, which hung together and was testable. He may not have known about genetics or had a clear idea of how heritability occurs, yet it’s startling to read this and realise how close he was to right at times. He may not always have backed the right theories, but he considered everything he could imagine, and carefully related it to his own theory. It’s remarkable just how willing he was to consider where his theory might be wrong, and discuss those weaknesses. It’s also remarkable how often he tested what he could, whether it be the germination of seeds soaked in sea water or how pollination works; he may not have had the equipment that we have now, but his attitude is surely a lesson that every aspiring scientist should take to heart.Honestly, I don’t know how anyone can read this and come away without understanding Darwin’s theory. He’s painstakingly clear, at length, with examples. If you’re reading this and coming to the conclusion that he didn’t support the idea of one species evolving into another, “macroevolution”, your reading comprehension is at fault. He makes it quite clear that “microevolution”, small changes in existing species, can and will lead to new species.Darwin was not right about everything, but he was right in many key ways — and he would be the first to admit that he could be wrong. He gave us a working, testable theory, one which has ample proof both in his work and in the world around us. Creationists have far too much to explain, by comparison.Originally reviewed for breathesbooks.com."
277,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"If you ever choose to read this work, be prepared for a lot of pigeon and bee and pea talk, and none about humans. ""The Origin of the Species"", presented here in its full first edition format (because the next 5 editions of it were just more in depth renderings on the same subjects, with some response to subsequent criticism added on top) does not include a single page, line or speculation on the origin of man. That, Darwin left for another book - you guessed it - ""The Descent of Man"". I've been meaning to read Origin for a long time, and have finally gotten around to it, expecting to be impressed and have my curiosity satisfied. I am and it was. I won't talk here about the writing itself, because it truly is just a long form scientific paper detailing experiments and hypotheses, trials and tribulations and the knowledge Darwin and others had on the subject. But I will say this: when you're reading it, bear something in mind. Think about the nuclear bomb-like quality this book had at the time it was published in intellectual circles everywhere. Think about how it shook and shattered the foundations of a Church which had been in power for around 1800 years at that point. Imagine the heretical nature it must have had (as it has today) in the eyes of indoctrinated people. And then think about how easy it is today for schools to refuse teaching evolution because ""it offends"" them, because it's not the truth they want. A few men - Darwin included - have dedicated their lives to a truth that even they didn't like and believe to begin with; they struggled with their own findings; they hated that they couldn't find evidence that would be more in line with their beliefs from childhood. But they never let that stop them. And they have given us the foundation for entire fields of science, from which we benefit from this day, whether we choose to accept it or not. I tried to read Origins with the mentality of a mid 19th Century and 2018 individual at the same time... it's awesome from both vantage points. "

Charles Darwin is the prophet of the natural selection theory and the Godfather of the struggle for survival.Darwin's work ""On The Origin of Species"" gives you a feel at times that you're reading something between a textbook and a book. This book is a short summary of his Voyage and 15 years of studying and researching organisms prior to writing this book. On the other hand, Darwin gives us an extensive detailed elaboration of his theory of evolution by means of natural selection.I wish he could have wrote more with regards to the humankind Species, but it was a different time, and writing this book was probably risky in itself.He was such a humble gentleman that he dedicated big portions of his book to the possible difficulties with his theory.I've read the Serbo-Croatian translation Postanak Vrsta autora Čarlsa Darvina / Akademska Knjiga 2009 6th Edition Publishing / 573 pages / 158,662 words."

It would have to be included on any short list of 'classics of science'. I have docked a star to reflect the fact that it's not always easy reading - there's that verbose quality to its style that characterizes most writing from the Victorian era. That said, I should point out that ""The Origin of Species"" is completely understandable to any general reader willing to give it a careful reading. You don't have to be a biologist to follow Darwin's argument. Two aspects of the book are astonishing; both underscore the brilliance of Darwin's accomplishment. The first is just how right he got things; the second is that he managed to fit all the major pieces of the puzzle in place with no knowledge of the actual mechanics of heredity. Mendel's work on genetics adn the elucidation of the structure of DNA would subsequently flesh out the details of the scheme proposed by Darwin; one has to bear in mind the actual state of knowledge in Darwin's time, and the prevailing intellectual climate, to appreciate fully the revolutionary nature of his argument. Upon re-reading the book this past weekend, I was reminded of certain endearing aspects that I had forgotten. One is Darwin's willingness to point out, and try to answer, what he perceived as the potential weaknesses in his argument. This is another: ""Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have, after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons"". Not quite as glamorous as the beasties he got to see from The Beagle, but he's continually observing, gathering data from any source available, always asking questions. You gotta love this book. But you gotta read it to love it. "
280,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33352366-elari,5,"As I was going through the Origin of Species page on Goodreads, I decided to check some of the one-star reviews. What I mainly found was:a) Creationists who didn’t read the book, but nonetheless needed to assert that humans are not descended from apes.b) Confused readers complaining about some obnoxious character called Alex. Since it was improbable that Darwin had given pet names to any creature whether living or fossilized, I looked into this one further and realized that a rather bad Nino Ricci novel was merged with Darwin’s science book. What a shame, Goodreads.c) Other confused readers who decided to give Darwin a one-star rating because of Ray Comfort’s introduction, which I think is utterly unfair to Darwin, although utterly fair to Comfort. Bash - Creationism Suite No.1 - PreludeThe edition I first started reading has a certain Ray Comfort gift us a very Special Introduction. This Mister – who also turns out to be a Christian Minister – desperately struggles to install the idea of a supreme being into Darwin’s theory before the latter gets a chance to speak. Mister Comfort Zone elaborates on moronic arguments that would make God himself flush with embarrassment, only to arrive at the conclusion that the complexity of life as we know it could not have evolved by chance (synonymous with eco-biochemistry in the creationist dialect). The conclusion of the book’s introduction, then, unlike the conclusion of the book itself, is that The Origin of Species is intelligent design.I’m surprised that decontextualizing quotes from prominent scientists to make them fit into the Comfort Combat is not considered an intellectual property infringement. The fact that this edition made it to print instead of court is very telling. For its disgraceful attempt at spoiling a science book with bad writing, the introduction deserves no stars at all. It’s almost a shame that it isn’t featured on GoodReads separately, but I won’t give Darwin’s book a low rating on its account. I’ll just pick another edition. The Origin of SpeciesReading On The Origin of Species isn’t about being introduced to a theory you know nothing about. Anyone remotely interested in evolution will reach this book as the culmination of a long winding road of scientific discoveries. It is still a priceless read, because of the quality of research and of its presentation. I have yet to find a work of art as beautiful as this science book.Darwin isn’t humorous in his writing. He is grave, patient, and humble. He is, beyond any doubt, the most modest of all the scientists I have ever met or read. Consider this: “To arrive at a just conclusion regarding the formation of the eye, with all its marvelous but not absolutely perfect characters, it is indispensable that the reason should conquer the imagination; but I have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at others hesitating to extend the principle of natural selection to so startling a length.” Moreover, he is so meticulous and precise that my sapient brain could die of fulfillment. Every tiny detail attended to—and there are so many—makes the whole of my intelligence appear tinier and tinier. It is most incredible that Darwin had to rely on empirical data, having no access to (and indeed no knowledge of) the genetic material, the basis of hereditable mutations. This intuition is beyond my comprehension.

After reading it, I whole-heartedly agree with the statement. Only when one reads Darwin's perspective on such topics as breeding, domestic speciation, migration, instinct, etc. does one come to fully realize how much this book ushered in a new age of modern thought. The Theory of Evolution is so pervasive in the mindset of today's world that only by reading the work can one understand how much of a statement Darwin was making by risking its publication. He very literally changed the world or, rather, told us how it had been changed.Within the book Darwin also makes many references to the ""beauty"" and ""wonder"" of nature, something that I found quite fascinating considering how many (or at least some) believe his works to be the antithesis of religious ideals. I gained a respect for Darwin's knowledge and love for the natural world that surrounds us, and there is no question that his words caused me to appreciate nature in both a scientific and spiritual sense. As my opening quote demonstrates, you owe it to yourself to read this book. It changed the way mankind viewed the planet, their relationship with it and, indeed, their relationship with their very origins. ""There is grandeur in this view of life..."""

A banned book.I can't rate this book honestly because I tend to rate books based on my feelings and I just can't rate this fundamental for science book the one star my feelings demand. Because reading this is pure torture. I've studied Dawrin's theory so I was interested in the way he came up to those conclusions. I was pretty surprised that he even managed to do it considering how much he didn't know back then. But the way the book was written... I won't lie it's a great sleeping aid. The repetitions and multiple examples for the same thing must have been crucial for convincing people back then but made me scream. I hate evolutionary genetics because for some reason I find it extremely boring. Still this is one of the pillars of today's biology so as a biologist I had to read it. But if you want to actually learn about Darwin's theory go find a biology textbook - it's explained much better. Or rather it's explained without all the boring details.

However, in the last chapter, he takes his time to briefly explain to us everything he has taught us during his works, in order to makes us perceive the wonderful struggle for existence surrounding us.The book makes you feel something like ""you deserve to be amazing, because life took such a contrivance to conceive you""."

285,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,2,"Um. The book opens with filler. You will want to jump to the Introduction, itself pretty turgid:""Indefinite variability is a much more common result of changed conditions than definite variability, and has probably played a more important part in the formation of our domestic races. We see indefinite variability in the endless slight peculiarities which distinguish the individuals of the same species, and which cannot be accounted for by inheritance from either parent or from some more remote ancestor."" OK, then! On to Chap. 1: ""When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of character than in true species. Domestic races often have a somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although differing from each other and from other species of the same genus, in several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part..."" Less turgid, but still pretty tough sledding, at least for me. Trying Chap 2: ""I am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the cases of variability, even in important parts of structure, which he could collect on good authority, as I have collected, during a course of years. It should be remembered that systematists are far from being pleased at finding variability in important characters, and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs, and compare them in many specimens of the same species.""OK.

Darwin was unusually reflexive and tempered in his writing, probably owing at least in part to the heavy disapproval he know he would encounter from everyone from the clergy to other scientists, but props to him for writing in a way that is at once confident and humble. Reading this after Feyerabend's Against Method, the major thing I took away from it was that science should always leave itself open to the consideration of new theories, even if those theories contradict the logical systems that presently reign. In the case of Darwin, it is utterly apparent (to me) that Natural Selection is an ethical and valuable creation myth that opens the field of scientific inquiry to an untold number of fresh possibilities. That it was abused by so-called social Darwinists and other politically motivated actors only reinforces my feeling that the ethical implications of all scientific theory should be subjected to at least as much rigor as data, methodology, and repeatability.Finally, Darwin uses awesome examples of strange animals."

But even from a strictly layperson's view, there are a number of things about The Origin of Species that greatly impressed me.His careful observations. It is obvious that he cared deeply about his work. He had made careful observations and comparisons about many species, both plants and animals. It is quite clear that he passionately loved nature.""He must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a [honey]comb, so beautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration.His elegant use of language. While the target audience of The Origin was his fellow scientists, he wrote clearly and plainly enough that a non-scientist could follow the main points of his argument. At the same time, there is a beauty and elegance in his use of language:""... it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts... not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.""His humility. He openly admitted the weak points of his theory - in fact, there is an entire chapter entitled ""Difficulties on Theory."" In addition, he gave credit to other scientists for their contributions to both his and their own fields of research. And yet, he doesn't back down in the face of objections. Consider this emphatic statement concerning geologic time:""He who can read Sir Charles Lyell's grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future historian will recognize as having produced a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how incomprehensibly vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume."" The fact that Darwin reached his conclusions from observation and experiment before the birth of modern genetics is even more remarkable. His postulation  ...that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other... has certainly been proven true by modern DNA evidence.It goes without saying that a considerable amount of his work has been superseded with newer and more accurate findings. Mr. Darwin died before the development of the theories of continental drift and plate tectonics. While reading this, I couldn't help thinking how amazed he would be if he were able to see all of today's various fields of science, especially DNA research. ""The whole history of the world, as at present known, although of a length quite incomprehensible by us, will hereafter be recognized as a mere fragment of time, compared with the ages which have lapsed since the first creature, the progenitor of innnumerable extinct and living descendants, was created. In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches.""Now for the criticism. Mr. Darwin tends to repeat himself. Perhaps he did this on purpose to reiterate his position. I confess, I skimmed the final chapter titled ""Recapitulation and Conclusion."" Also, as has been often noted, Darwin was in a rush to publish and omitted quite a lot of data that supported his conclusions. As Thomas Henry Huxley said about The Origin of Species:...a sort of intellectual pemmican - a mass of facts crushed and pounded into shape, rather than held together by the ordinary medium of an obvious logical bond...Again, for sheer want of room, much has to be taken for granted which might readily enough be proved... the novice in biology is apt to complain of the frequency of what he fancies is gratuitous assumption .(Yet, in spite of those rather harsh words, Huxley was one of the most vocal and vehement supporters of Darwin's theory, becoming known as ""Darwin's Bulldog."")"

The Apollo guidance computer had less computing power than average modern family car. This is how we should view Darwin's 'Origin Of The Species'. It is an absolute triumph of empirical evidence based science. By the most constant and careful observation of the natural world Darwin not only worked out the theory of evolution he also quite correctly realised that all life forms on this planet are related to one another, ""by which all living and extinct beings are united by complex,radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand system""The first two chapters and the last chapter are where the general reader can feel the sparkle of Darwin's ideas and his profound infatuation with nature and its works. These chapters are also the best written and not surprisingly are a thrilling rush of theory and ideas.The vast bulk of the work is the minutiae of his ideas. It is, I have to say, cumbersome to read. It is the sort of sub clausal slog that a lot of nineteenth century writing gets bogged down in. Darwin's modesty in quoting and attributing to others and his unfailing scientific fearlessness in saying 'OK here is where my theory falls over' makes him a figure of unimpeachable scientific integrity.After reading this book I can understand the affection and respect that Darwin has been held in by those who try to base their lives in reason and science."

Definitely 5/5.Darwin's theory in a nutshell: Nature selects organisms with certain features (variations) to pass on their traits that help them survive (against competition – for food, shelter, mates – the environment and predators), forming different species (descendants with modification from a common ancestor) over many generations. Other factors that contribute to natural selection: diversification, living conditions, disuse of body parts. The species that can’t develop such traits eventually go extinct because nature keeps populations in balance (no population can grow forever, not even us: see Lovelock).Natural selection also modifies instincts (e.g. geometrically perfect beehives), and through variations in their reproductive systems why different species can’t procreate with one another (and if they do, their offspring is sterile)"

Which was my first encounter in Charles Darwin and all he and his work was about - Darwin’s finches, natural selection, evolution over time and his revolutionary voyage on the HMS Beagle was in just about every genetics module and evolution base modules I was taught. I’ve been encountering snippets of his work all throughout my studies, a quote here, an excerpt there and thought it was about time I go straight to the source and read On the Origin of Species. It’s such an original, a legend in its own right in its revolutionary reports and observations. I find it quite frankly amazing how much this amazing man deduced and discovered considering it was during a time when many of the scientific discoveries we have come to know now as common knowledge (like DNA) were unheard of back then. I’m glad I finally got round the reading the writings of the man who shaped our world in so many ways with the science he produced in this book. I feel like I can call myself a scientist and a science lover now that I’ve read these writings that’s at the heart of our genetics and evolutionary knowledge, providing the foundations to springboard into our current age of scientific enlightenment and discovery!"

In the twenty-first century, this book should not be read for the science it. Darwin didn’t know mutations, he didn’t even know Mendel’s Laws! The important thing about this book is the change of world view it brought: we, humans, are not special! This story is not about us! In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us: we became self aware only to realize we are not protagonists. We are not on the top of the evolutionary scale, we are not more perfect than other living beings. This story began much before us and will probably end long after us. “Origin” helped us realize that.Darwin was a man ahead of his time, and I admire him greatly.Excellent read! "
294,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334545-david-s-t,3,"I figured while I was on my evolution book kick, I might as well go back to the original (well sort of the original, Alfred Russel Wallace published a paper on natural selection which prompted Darwin to publish this “abstract”). Now that I'm finished I feel two different ways about the book, a loved yet bored type of feeling. First I'm amazed at just how much of Darwin's theories and ideas are accurate and accepted even today 150 years later (which is a pretty darn long time in science). One thing you have to appreciate about this book is that its pretty evident that Darwin didn't just rush out and publish this theories but thought about every possible question everyone could have and he attempts to answer them all. Another question he spends a lot of time on is how flora could make it to islands, he goes through page after page of experiments trying to see how long seeds can stay in salt water and still germinate. Even better way back 150 years ago Darwin already anticipated the irreducible complexity argument of the eye and proposed his own ideas about how the eye could evolve and how each gradation is useful in itself. Some times the prose was pretty amazing, I think the famous line about “There is grandeur in this view of life.....” is one of my favorites in any book I've read.So as amazing as some parts where why then did I rate it 3 stars? Well for every amazing part there are page after page of material which is (to me) just plain boring. The prose which is great in sections is pretty tedious in other parts. The fact that he thought of every question means that he goes over proof after proof. Remember the salt water and the seeds mentioned above, well its cool at first but 40 pages of his experiments makes me start to care less and less. There were also a few parts which he got wrong, he spends a whole section trying to figure out why certain animals can't cross breed, something which is quickly addressed now days with DNA. I think at another part he denies that there ever were any mass extinctions (something we know happened several times in the earth's history). Another thing which made the book a little harder for me is Darwin mentions lots of people and animals I've never heard of, of course a better reader would have spend time looking them up but I just read on, I guess I didn't care enough to do that much research for the book. So overall for importance I'd rate this book a 5/5, but I have to factor in enjoyment and I so its gets the lower score. Truthfully this book is 150 years old and written in Victorian English, its very important, but there are better books on evolution out there, so if you're curious about the fascinating world of evolution, start elsewhere, only if you're curious about how the theory got started pick this one up.

I should not have been and am glad I did for the following reasons,1) The book reads as well as any of the good popular science books available on audible. It is written as if his attended audience is for a 13 year old. That's how good of a writer Darwin is.2) I had obtained a google book version, but couldn't bring myself to read it, and I had obtained a free audio version floating around the net, but this audio version is professionally read and doesn't suffer at all from the narrator.3) The book lays out a very complicated argument in 13 basically independent chapters. Each chapter by itself is enough to convince the listener of the fact of evolution by natural selection. The author is very smooth at telling you what he's going to tell you, then tell you, and then explain to you what he has just told you.4) The book is a guidebook on how to lay out an argument and convince others to your viewpoint. He makes sure that he fairly presents criticism that could attack his theory and refutes it masterfully.5) My favorite reason for having read this book is that my smugness index has gone up. When I come across people who haven't read the book and deny the scientific fact of evolution I can now say that I have listened to the book and smugly add statements like ""even a thirteen year old can understand evolution, haven't you even read 'On the Origin of Species'""."

In all honesty, this one was a challenge to get through at times -- often tedious in the sheer amount of detail, and the frequent repetition and reiteration of key arguments. I wish it had been about half as long, but I'm glad to be able to say I've read it. All that said, this book is a tour de force. The mark of a good theory is that it seems blatantly obvious in retrospect. I often had to remind myself what a revolutionary idea this was at the time, and yet the strength of Darwin's argument is overwhelming. The breadth and depth of his knowledge and research is also astonishing -- from talking about crossbreeds of plants I've never even heard of, to laying out the specific geological conditions under which fossils can be formed. It's hard to believe that he was able to lay out this theory well before the discovery of Mendelian inheritance (let alone DNA) and Pangea. The fact that he was able to come up with this elegant explanation of the origin of species without that knowledge, and still make such a compelling argument for it, is so impressive. ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."""

300,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"So this is the foundation of the theory of evolution. No, Darwin was not the first or only one with musings much like the ones described in this book, but he took some other people's theories (incl. that of his own grandfather) and took them further or perfected them.After having spent 5 years on the Beagle and thus seeing all kinds of places, Darwin had returned to England. It would be many years before he published this book but during the last stretch of the journey, Darwin had discovered something along some of the specimen he had collected on the Galápagos Islands. No, it was not his famous finches. Those he had forgotten (or not known) to label, thus no longer knowing which bird came from which of the islands. It was also not the famous tortoises as every single one of the ones taken on board the Beagle had been eaten and the shell been thrown overboard.Luckily, there were still the mockingbirds. And like all animals on the Galápagos, they too were different on every island and he HAD labelled them.Thus, he saw that while they were all mockingbirds, they had slight differences, especially when it came to their beaks, which gave him the idea of them being specialized to the life conditions on their respective island.It was also the Galápagos Islands that gave him the idea of volcanic activity birthing an island. He just didn't know about plate tectonics yet, sadly, as that theory was only established (and proven) about 100 years later.Thus, he talks of evolution as nature's way of selecting traits most suited for whatever life a creature lives. He talks about sexual selection and extinction of animals.Think back to those times: mankind thought themselves the master of the Earth, as God had willed it. God, the omnipotent being, had created all things. Evolution, therefore, was blasphemy as it meant God either at least changing his mind or having made mistakes. You can imagine how some people reacted once this book had been written and published.However, while reading this book, I was delighted to see that Darwin never bashed religious people but simply didn't talk about religion at all. Maybe he had learned not to broach the subject since he was married to a Catholic. *lol* Instead, he simply laid out his theory and his reasons for having established it, giving ample proof while listing the single steps. And whenever there was a gap, he would address it and explain why it was there, what the likely answer was and, again, why.I was astonished and more than pleased to see how he had written this book. Much like in his journal about the voyage on the Beagle, he shows a beautiful writing style and wrote this book not only for scholars but - and this was radical as well - for the layman to understand. A complex and new concept explained in a simple way to make the science accessible.Like when he talked about humans breeding dogs to be of a certain size and character traits or gardeners crossing different flowers to get certain petal shapes and colours.He took Humboldt's ""web of life"" and transformed it into his famous ""tree of life"". There were a few minor errors (we know now) but all in all, his logic was sound - only limited, sometimes, by some thing or other that hadn't yet been discovered or explained. My hardcover edition had beautiful illustrations. Some were Darwin's sketches, other were oil paintings of animals he was talking about in the book. However, much like with the other book, there is an audio version narrated by Dawkins that is really very good despite being abridged.Where humankind would be without Darwin and this book, I do not know. We owe Darwin and his work a lot, though, that's for sure."
301,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92443064-andra,0,"It is difficult to rate this, as Charles Darwin is evidently not a writer. His work and theories, however, I find genius."
302,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477945-kendall,5,"Finally re-read after decades of good intentions. For a recondite classic it is full of surprises, mostly pleasant; its supposed impenetrability largely confined to parts we already knew were directed at specialists—I admit to slogging through the section on barnacles, for example. But Origins is highly readable, pleasurable even, almost in the way of an Edmund Wilson essay. Darwin proceeds deliberately through the mountain of evidence he collected over twenty years as he constructs a virtually unassailable intellectual structure. Freely recognizing arguments against natural selection—the central thread of the book—he gives his best arguments based on the knowledge of his day while carefully pointing out its limitations. I was not prepared for how well he anticipated later discoveries—Mendel’s pioneering work in genetics didn’t see publication until the early 20th century yet dovetails almost seamlessly into Origins exposition, as does the Modern Synthesis. If you’re interested in any of the broad fields of biology-evolution, taxonomy, genetics—The Origin of Species is a must read. If you are a creationist, even in its deceptive guise of intelligent design, you are not intellectually honest if you have not read and honestly come to grips with this book; which gives the lie to the railings of a few misguided Christians and Muslims who seem to think it a product of their devil. Yet, so thoughtful and measured a book makes it clear any devils are in the eye of the beholder. "
303,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,4,"In reading The Origin of Species, one of the things I found myself respecting most about Charles Darwin was his aversion to dogma, religious or otherwise. He was generally logical, reasonable, and slow to jump to conclusions, and it seems to me that the enduring quality of this book owes much to these traits in its author. 
""From these and similar considerations, but chiefly from our ignorance of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United States; and from the revolution in our palæontological ideas on many points, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected, it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of organic beings throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its productions.""
"
304,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13229843-ben-batchelder,1,"Charles Darwin’s “The Origin of Species” promises a lot. A back cover blurb says, “Next to the Bible no work has been quite as influential....” I’m not a scientist, but with a build up like that I had to give it a try after enjoying “The Voyage of the Beagle” (reviewed 9/5/13).It is a slog of a read, yet Darwin’s enthusiasm for his subject, the excitement he conveys in outlining the work of his lifetime and popularizing a scientific movement, are palpable. Ironically, Darwin was not a scientist himself, but a “naturalist,” whose first job in the field – to be the Beagle’s naturalist-on-board – was a bit of a lark, suggested by friends, after his prior path to becoming an Anglican pastor (his father’s preference) came to naught.His insights – not entirely original, as he really consolidated lines of thinking going on for several generations – stemmed not only from his visit to the Galapagos Islands on the Beagle, but from observing man-driven selection in the breeding of domesticated animals.  I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man’s power of selection. But the expression...Survival of the Fittest is more accurate...” (p.61) Yet the problems start right away. As Creationist Kent Hovind has pointed out, the assumption that natural selection causes evolution is problematic, for “natural selection” never creates, it only selects. Furthermore, “survival of the fittest” is a tautology, for by definition the fit survive and the survivors are fit. As Hovind points out, natural selection might be more clearly called differential reproduction, that is, some reproduce more than others.And what drove Darwin to this line of thinking? It turns out he was a Malthusian, the Chicken Little of his time:It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them. (p. 63) The implication being, for some to live, others must die. Death, then, turns out to be the selection method of the Universe, in the never-ending struggle to survive. Or, as he succinctly states, “Thus, extinction and natural selection go hand in hand.” (p.161)Sensing how grim his outlook might appear, Darwin tries to pre-empt: When we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply. (p.75) Call it the theory of Happy Death then, one of many assertions that don’t ring true. No fear is felt? Death is generally prompt? Well, then, bring on more of this necessary (per Malthus) and creative force!Elevating nature to a Capitalized Power, Darwin characterizes it as less selfish than we: “Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends.” (p.79)Around this part of the book came the first of many mentions (that I noticed) of the phrase “scale of nature,” which of course is a direct descendent of Plato’s and Aristotle’s Scala Naturae, showing a direct link to the pagan concept of a hierarchy of development that was transformed into the the Great Chain of Being by the Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century. This pagan belief in a hierarcy of more and less developed beings may have influenced Darwin’s unfortunate choice of sub-title: “By Means of Natural Selection of the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.” It is difficult to find a modern edition of the book that hasn’t scrubbed clean this evidence of Darwin’s easy racism. (Only in my 150th Anniversary Edition, from Signet Classics in 2003, could I find the sub-title in any edition on-line – tucked away in a title page inside.) One can see why Darwin’s boosters try to re-write history, for the sub-title’s “favoured races” helps explain how Social Darwinism – only disavowed by evolution’s supporters after the horrors of WWII – created so much havoc in the 20th century. (Marx and Stalin were nominally Christian before reading Darwin; both Stalin and Hitler appropriated Darwin for their perverted, murderous philosophies.)In terms of other influences, Darwin often refers to Charles Lyell and his (literally) ground-breaking “Principles of Geology” which, by positing long geological ages, gave breathing room for Darwin’s theory of numerous “slight variations” to evolve, of minuscule improvements multiplied over unimaginably many iterations. He goes so far as to warn skeptical readers:	He who can read Sir Charles Lyell’s grand work on the Principles of Geology...and yet does not admit how vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume. (p. 316) If you are detecting a certain stridency, you are not alone.And what was it that excited Darwin so much to dedicate his life to? Simply stated, it is the mechanism by which modifications occur within a species in response to environmental pressures. The same way that man could take the primordial wolf and encourage endless variations into hundreds of dog breeds, so could evolution (in what we would call today, micro-evolution) encourage those famous finches of Galapagos Islands to vary in beak sizes in adaptation to micro-environments.But Darwin wishes to go much further than that. In fact, he seems to indulge in frequent straw man arguments, saying that “special creation” would have no explanation for the facts he marshals, as though his critics assert dogs could only have been independently created at the beginning of time.Perhaps something like this was the prevailing wisdom at the time – that no species, or what we might call sub-species today, could develop into another. Yet, to contemporary ears, he doth protest too much.In fact, he takes his valuable insights and then extrapolates them to incredible lengths. (The theory of evolution remains just that, a theory, rather than the supreme law as treated by so many moderns.) His animation takes wing with passages such as this:	It is a truly wonderful fact – the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity – that all animal and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other... (p. 126) After long dancing around the controversial bush of his own creation, by book’s end he admits, “I believe that animals are descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or less number.” (p.502) But even here he prevaricates, for in the book’s last paragraph he triumphs, “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator [Nature?] into a few forms or into one...” (p.507) So which is it? Four or five or just one “form”? Either way, now we are really talking about Macro Evolution!Yet, sadly, not one concrete example – that has then or since been confirmed as a proven fact – is given of one species evolving into a wholly new one. (In fact, from our more modern understanding of mutations and how DNA works, mutations never allow for a gain in information, only its loss, which makes evolving from the simple ameoba to the incredibly complex human being patently impossible, the stuff of pure fantasy.)To his credit, Darwin brings up (what were at the time) the objections most “fatal,” or potentially fatal, to his theory. One was related to the fossil record, the other to how evolution could possibly explain for extremely complex organs which would have been useless when only partially created and, under the logic of the theory, would have been eradicated by natural selection long before completion.Let’s take the critical area of fossil evidence, or complete lack of it. Darwin readily admits there should be countless examples of intermediary forms (for example, showing how a reptile grew wings to become a bird), and asks:	Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely-graduated organic chain, and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory. (p.314) The reason, he answers back in 1859, is “that the geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect” (p.327), that is, we hadn’t dug up enough fossils yet.Jump ahead over 150 years, with numberless excavations and bones found all over the world, and there are still no such fossils. While there have been numerous hoaxes, including Piltdown Man, Nebraska Man, an the Archaeoraptor, or “dino-bird” – such is modern man’s obsession with trying to prove evolution – the lack of fossil record is a real brain-twister for evolutionists. As Colin Patterson, the late senior paleotogologist of the British Museum of Natural History, admitted, “there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.” (1979 letter to Luther D. Sutherland, cited in his “Darwin’s Enigma: Ebbing the Tide of Naturalism,” 1988, p. 89)The other big strike against evolution, forwarded by Darwin himself, was the feasibility of countless small evolutionary steps creating a complex organ which is all but worthless until whole. 	To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberation, could have been formed by natural selection seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. (p.172) His stab at explaining away the problem, as absurd as those by current apoligists, such as Richard Dawkins, is to find the tiniest benefit from even 100th of an eye which, multiplied over eons, brings us the remarkable present. For, “if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though unsuperable by our imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory.” (p.172) So something “unsuperable by our imagination’ should not be subversive to the theory?							 Yet, to my layman’s eyes, Darwin makes relatively few such categorical errors. Although DNA’s molecular structure would only be discovered nearly a century after the book’s launch, he rightly conjectures the inter-relatedness of all life, saying “that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking...” (p.437) as “the one known cause of close similarity in organic beings...” (p.432). Yes, it turns out all organisms were created with the same basic genetic code or language, known today as DNA.But he takes his conjectures to overwrought degrees, using morphology (the study of form and structure of organic beings) to imply all animals descend from the same ancestor (or two) and embryology to claim our ancient forms are revealed in early embryonic development. Among the many hoaxes used to try to confirm Darwin’s work, embryology as proof of evolution has, perhaps, the longest legs. Remember the Intro Biology chart which shows how the earliest human fetus has fish-like “gill slits” which proves that among our ancestors are dead fish? Or the one which supposedly demonstrates how all vertebrates look nearly identical soon after conception? Despite the drawings, originally from one Ernst Haeckel in 1874, having over a century ago been revealed as fakes, they still grace many biology textbooks.Much has changed since Darwin’s book was published, so we shouldn’t be too harsh on the man. You have to wonder, though, if Darwin were alive today and realized that fossil evidence still did not exist, would he be consistent and admit he went too far? (Today’s evolutionists have tried to explain away the lack of fossil record with a new theory, called punctuated equilibrium, or vast periods of no change followed by sudden and great leaps – hence the scarcity of fossils – but Darwin himself argues against it. (p.187))Darwin also believed in only a simple structure at the atom level, facilitating the idea that man could evolve from, say, an ameoba. But DNA has proven the opposite, that the number of genes within one human body of over 100 trillion equals the number of stars in 1,000 galaxies (of 100 billion stars each). We also now know that in mutations, the supposed engine of evolution, information is always lost and never gained.Knowing what we know today, would Darwin still believe in Darwinism?While his excitement in synthesizing a ground-breaking theory is palpable, did Darwin really need to macro-itize the obvious truth (in retrospect) of micro-evolution? It makes you wonder if there can be too much of a good thing. I recently read a review in the Wall Street Journal titled “The Ship of the Imagination” while pondering Darwin’s work. Rather breathlessly, the reviewer exults, “[the author] tracks other scientific efforts to achieve the apparently miraculous, including mind reading, the search for immortality, love potions, and the creation of demi-gods – or at least superhumans.” (Michael Saler, WSJ, 12/18/15) Could too much imagination be a bad thing?Since Darwin, science has become increasingly untethered from ethical considerations. Interestingly, as Vishal Mangalwadi pointed out in his magisterial “The Book That Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization,” no major new scientific laws have been formulated since in the last century following this untethering.Arguably, what we have now is less science than Scientism, where flawed theories such as Darwin’s have to be treated as the Law of the Land. The same Colin Patterson mentioned above searched for evolutionists who, out of the public glare, would stand up for evolution as we understand it today. Revealingly, from several such encounters he wrote:	I’ve tried putting a simple question to various people and groups of people. Question is: Can you tell me anything you about evolution, any one thing, that is true? I tried that question on the geology staff at the Field Museum of Natural History and the only answer I got was silence. I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary Morphology Seminar in the University of Chicago, a very prestigious body of evolutionists, and all I got there was silence for a long time and eventually one person said, “I do know one thing – it ought not be taught in high school.” (Cited in Stephen Jones, “Evolutionsm and Creationsim,” 11/5/82, p.1) Could it be that Darwin succumbed, too, to the vanity of his own imagination? And for how much longer must we carry him aloft?"

This has nothing to do with religion and humans are more a footnote. This is a biology book mostly about animals and natural selection. While this book talks a little about evolution, that's not really why it's important. I think some reviews and people focus too much on the history of this book rather than what is actually in this book. If you don't pick up the fact that Darwin was hugely into birds and they helped his studies, reread this book again. Every chapter he talks about some kind of bird and relates it to the primary subject. The controversy seems to have started by one little part in this book, but it's his other book where he talks about humans. He ignored humans for the most part because of Malthus.While this is an important read, this book gets boring if you're not interested in zoology or biology. I've said this before but I had ducks for three years, so I'm very interested in animal studies. I didn't really want to read this book before only because I knew my past self would find this boring. Just know what your about to read instead of thinking everyone needs to read this before they die."
306,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I’m doing a biology degree, and I’ve always been an admirer of (and a believer in) the theory of evolution through natural selection, so it seemed high time I finally went to hear it from the horse’s mouth. Not that Darwin came up with the idea out of nothing, of course; it was “in the air” at the time, and other scientists were thinking along similar lines — Lamarck and Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, to name just two. Not to mention, of course, Alfred Wallace, who could’ve beaten Darwin to publication.But Charles Darwin was the first to publish a theory which really made sense, which hung together and was testable. He may not have known about genetics or had a clear idea of how heritability occurs, yet it’s startling to read this and realise how close he was to right at times. He may not always have backed the right theories, but he considered everything he could imagine, and carefully related it to his own theory. It’s remarkable just how willing he was to consider where his theory might be wrong, and discuss those weaknesses. It’s also remarkable how often he tested what he could, whether it be the germination of seeds soaked in sea water or how pollination works; he may not have had the equipment that we have now, but his attitude is surely a lesson that every aspiring scientist should take to heart.Honestly, I don’t know how anyone can read this and come away without understanding Darwin’s theory. He’s painstakingly clear, at length, with examples. If you’re reading this and coming to the conclusion that he didn’t support the idea of one species evolving into another, “macroevolution”, your reading comprehension is at fault. He makes it quite clear that “microevolution”, small changes in existing species, can and will lead to new species.Darwin was not right about everything, but he was right in many key ways — and he would be the first to admit that he could be wrong. He gave us a working, testable theory, one which has ample proof both in his work and in the world around us. Creationists have far too much to explain, by comparison.Originally reviewed for breathesbooks.com."

""The Origin of the Species"", presented here in its full first edition format (because the next 5 editions of it were just more in depth renderings on the same subjects, with some response to subsequent criticism added on top) does not include a single page, line or speculation on the origin of man. That, Darwin left for another book - you guessed it - ""The Descent of Man"". I've been meaning to read Origin for a long time, and have finally gotten around to it, expecting to be impressed and have my curiosity satisfied. I am and it was. I won't talk here about the writing itself, because it truly is just a long form scientific paper detailing experiments and hypotheses, trials and tribulations and the knowledge Darwin and others had on the subject. But I will say this: when you're reading it, bear something in mind. Think about the nuclear bomb-like quality this book had at the time it was published in intellectual circles everywhere. Think about how it shook and shattered the foundations of a Church which had been in power for around 1800 years at that point. Imagine the heretical nature it must have had (as it has today) in the eyes of indoctrinated people. And then think about how easy it is today for schools to refuse teaching evolution because ""it offends"" them, because it's not the truth they want. A few men - Darwin included - have dedicated their lives to a truth that even they didn't like and believe to begin with; they struggled with their own findings; they hated that they couldn't find evidence that would be more in line with their beliefs from childhood. But they never let that stop them. And they have given us the foundation for entire fields of science, from which we benefit from this day, whether we choose to accept it or not. I tried to read Origins with the mentality of a mid 19th Century and 2018 individual at the same time... it's awesome from both vantage points. "

Charles Darwin is the prophet of the natural selection theory and the Godfather of the struggle for survival.Darwin's work ""On The Origin of Species"" gives you a feel at times that you're reading something between a textbook and a book. This book is a short summary of his Voyage and 15 years of studying and researching organisms prior to writing this book. On the other hand, Darwin gives us an extensive detailed elaboration of his theory of evolution by means of natural selection.I wish he could have wrote more with regards to the humankind Species, but it was a different time, and writing this book was probably risky in itself.He was such a humble gentleman that he dedicated big portions of his book to the possible difficulties with his theory.I've read the Serbo-Croatian translation Postanak Vrsta autora Čarlsa Darvina / Akademska Knjiga 2009 6th Edition Publishing / 573 pages / 158,662 words."

It would have to be included on any short list of 'classics of science'. I have docked a star to reflect the fact that it's not always easy reading - there's that verbose quality to its style that characterizes most writing from the Victorian era. That said, I should point out that ""The Origin of Species"" is completely understandable to any general reader willing to give it a careful reading. You don't have to be a biologist to follow Darwin's argument. Two aspects of the book are astonishing; both underscore the brilliance of Darwin's accomplishment. The first is just how right he got things; the second is that he managed to fit all the major pieces of the puzzle in place with no knowledge of the actual mechanics of heredity. Mendel's work on genetics adn the elucidation of the structure of DNA would subsequently flesh out the details of the scheme proposed by Darwin; one has to bear in mind the actual state of knowledge in Darwin's time, and the prevailing intellectual climate, to appreciate fully the revolutionary nature of his argument. Upon re-reading the book this past weekend, I was reminded of certain endearing aspects that I had forgotten. One is Darwin's willingness to point out, and try to answer, what he perceived as the potential weaknesses in his argument. This is another: ""Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have, after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons"". Not quite as glamorous as the beasties he got to see from The Beagle, but he's continually observing, gathering data from any source available, always asking questions. You gotta love this book.

310,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33352366-elari,5,"As I was going through the Origin of Species page on Goodreads, I decided to check some of the one-star reviews. What I mainly found was:a) Creationists who didn’t read the book, but nonetheless needed to assert that humans are not descended from apes.b) Confused readers complaining about some obnoxious character called Alex. Since it was improbable that Darwin had given pet names to any creature whether living or fossilized, I looked into this one further and realized that a rather bad Nino Ricci novel was merged with Darwin’s science book. What a shame, Goodreads.c) Other confused readers who decided to give Darwin a one-star rating because of Ray Comfort’s introduction, which I think is utterly unfair to Darwin, although utterly fair to Comfort. Bash - Creationism Suite No.1 - PreludeThe edition I first started reading has a certain Ray Comfort gift us a very Special Introduction. This Mister – who also turns out to be a Christian Minister – desperately struggles to install the idea of a supreme being into Darwin’s theory before the latter gets a chance to speak. Mister Comfort Zone elaborates on moronic arguments that would make God himself flush with embarrassment, only to arrive at the conclusion that the complexity of life as we know it could not have evolved by chance (synonymous with eco-biochemistry in the creationist dialect). The conclusion of the book’s introduction, then, unlike the conclusion of the book itself, is that The Origin of Species is intelligent design.I’m surprised that decontextualizing quotes from prominent scientists to make them fit into the Comfort Combat is not considered an intellectual property infringement. The fact that this edition made it to print instead of court is very telling. For its disgraceful attempt at spoiling a science book with bad writing, the introduction deserves no stars at all. It’s almost a shame that it isn’t featured on GoodReads separately, but I won’t give Darwin’s book a low rating on its account. I’ll just pick another edition. The Origin of SpeciesReading On The Origin of Species isn’t about being introduced to a theory you know nothing about. Anyone remotely interested in evolution will reach this book as the culmination of a long winding road of scientific discoveries. It is still a priceless read, because of the quality of research and of its presentation. I have yet to find a work of art as beautiful as this science book.Darwin isn’t humorous in his writing. He is grave, patient, and humble. He is, beyond any doubt, the most modest of all the scientists I have ever met or read. Consider this: “To arrive at a just conclusion regarding the formation of the eye, with all its marvelous but not absolutely perfect characters, it is indispensable that the reason should conquer the imagination; but I have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at others hesitating to extend the principle of natural selection to so startling a length.” Moreover, he is so meticulous and precise that my sapient brain could die of fulfillment. Every tiny detail attended to—and there are so many—makes the whole of my intelligence appear tinier and tinier. It is most incredible that Darwin had to rely on empirical data, having no access to (and indeed no knowledge of) the genetic material, the basis of hereditable mutations. This intuition is beyond my comprehension. How could one man foresee such an immense and intricate scheme of things despite the widely accepted, unquestionable doctrines of his time?Compulsory Postscript: Tim Minchin on Americans and Evolution."

After reading it, I whole-heartedly agree with the statement. Only when one reads Darwin's perspective on such topics as breeding, domestic speciation, migration, instinct, etc. does one come to fully realize how much this book ushered in a new age of modern thought. The Theory of Evolution is so pervasive in the mindset of today's world that only by reading the work can one understand how much of a statement Darwin was making by risking its publication. He very literally changed the world or, rather, told us how it had been changed.Within the book Darwin also makes many references to the ""beauty"" and ""wonder"" of nature, something that I found quite fascinating considering how many (or at least some) believe his works to be the antithesis of religious ideals. I gained a respect for Darwin's knowledge and love for the natural world that surrounds us, and there is no question that his words caused me to appreciate nature in both a scientific and spiritual sense. As my opening quote demonstrates, you owe it to yourself to read this book. It changed the way mankind viewed the planet, their relationship with it and, indeed, their relationship with their very origins. ""There is grandeur in this view of life..."""

Because reading this is pure torture. I've studied Dawrin's theory so I was interested in the way he came up to those conclusions. I was pretty surprised that he even managed to do it considering how much he didn't know back then. But the way the book was written... I won't lie it's a great sleeping aid. The repetitions and multiple examples for the same thing must have been crucial for convincing people back then but made me scream. I hate evolutionary genetics because for some reason I find it extremely boring. Still this is one of the pillars of today's biology so as a biologist I had to read it.

However, in the last chapter, he takes his time to briefly explain to us everything he has taught us during his works, in order to makes us perceive the wonderful struggle for existence surrounding us.The book makes you feel something like ""you deserve to be amazing, because life took such a contrivance to conceive you""."

OK, then!

Darwin was unusually reflexive and tempered in his writing, probably owing at least in part to the heavy disapproval he know he would encounter from everyone from the clergy to other scientists, but props to him for writing in a way that is at once confident and humble. Reading this after Feyerabend's Against Method, the major thing I took away from it was that science should always leave itself open to the consideration of new theories, even if those theories contradict the logical systems that presently reign. In the case of Darwin, it is utterly apparent (to me) that Natural Selection is an ethical and valuable creation myth that opens the field of scientific inquiry to an untold number of fresh possibilities. That it was abused by so-called social Darwinists and other politically motivated actors only reinforces my feeling that the ethical implications of all scientific theory should be subjected to at least as much rigor as data, methodology, and repeatability.Finally, Darwin uses awesome examples of strange animals."

318,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6535930-pamela-shropshire,4,"""It is a truly wonderful fact – the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity – that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group, in the manner which we everywhere behold, namely, varieties of the same species most closely related together, species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together, forming sections of sub-genera much less closely related, and genera related in different degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and classes.""I am by no means a scientist, and I do not pretend to have understood all of Mr. Darwin's arguments. But even from a strictly layperson's view, there are a number of things about The Origin of Species that greatly impressed me.His careful observations. It is obvious that he cared deeply about his work. He had made careful observations and comparisons about many species, both plants and animals. It is quite clear that he passionately loved nature.""He must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a [honey]comb, so beautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration.His elegant use of language. While the target audience of The Origin was his fellow scientists, he wrote clearly and plainly enough that a non-scientist could follow the main points of his argument. At the same time, there is a beauty and elegance in his use of language:""... it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts... not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.""His humility. He openly admitted the weak points of his theory - in fact, there is an entire chapter entitled ""Difficulties on Theory."" In addition, he gave credit to other scientists for their contributions to both his and their own fields of research. And yet, he doesn't back down in the face of objections. Consider this emphatic statement concerning geologic time:""He who can read Sir Charles Lyell's grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future historian will recognize as having produced a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how incomprehensibly vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume."" The fact that Darwin reached his conclusions from observation and experiment before the birth of modern genetics is even more remarkable. His postulation  ...that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other... has certainly been proven true by modern DNA evidence.It goes without saying that a considerable amount of his work has been superseded with newer and more accurate findings. Mr. Darwin died before the development of the theories of continental drift and plate tectonics. While reading this, I couldn't help thinking how amazed he would be if he were able to see all of today's various fields of science, especially DNA research. ""The whole history of the world, as at present known, although of a length quite incomprehensible by us, will hereafter be recognized as a mere fragment of time, compared with the ages which have lapsed since the first creature, the progenitor of innnumerable extinct and living descendants, was created. In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches.""Now for the criticism. Mr. Darwin tends to repeat himself. Perhaps he did this on purpose to reiterate his position. I confess, I skimmed the final chapter titled ""Recapitulation and Conclusion."" Also, as has been often noted, Darwin was in a rush to publish and omitted quite a lot of data that supported his conclusions. As Thomas Henry Huxley said about The Origin of Species:...a sort of intellectual pemmican - a mass of facts crushed and pounded into shape, rather than held together by the ordinary medium of an obvious logical bond...Again, for sheer want of room, much has to be taken for granted which might readily enough be proved... the novice in biology is apt to complain of the frequency of what he fancies is gratuitous assumption .(Yet, in spite of those rather harsh words, Huxley was one of the most vocal and vehement supporters of Darwin's theory, becoming known as ""Darwin's Bulldog."")"

The Apollo guidance computer had less computing power than average modern family car. This is how we should view Darwin's 'Origin Of The Species'. It is an absolute triumph of empirical evidence based science. By the most constant and careful observation of the natural world Darwin not only worked out the theory of evolution he also quite correctly realised that all life forms on this planet are related to one another, ""by which all living and extinct beings are united by complex,radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand system""The first two chapters and the last chapter are where the general reader can feel the sparkle of Darwin's ideas and his profound infatuation with nature and its works. These chapters are also the best written and not surprisingly are a thrilling rush of theory and ideas.The vast bulk of the work is the minutiae of his ideas. It is, I have to say, cumbersome to read. It is the sort of sub clausal slog that a lot of nineteenth century writing gets bogged down in. Darwin's modesty in quoting and attributing to others and his unfailing scientific fearlessness in saying 'OK here is where my theory falls over' makes him a figure of unimpeachable scientific integrity.After reading this book I can understand the affection and respect that Darwin has been held in by those who try to base their lives in reason and science."

Definitely 5/5.Darwin's theory in a nutshell: Nature selects organisms with certain features (variations) to pass on their traits that help them survive (against competition – for food, shelter, mates – the environment and predators), forming different species (descendants with modification from a common ancestor) over many generations. Other factors that contribute to natural selection: diversification, living conditions, disuse of body parts. The species that can’t develop such traits eventually go extinct because nature keeps populations in balance (no population can grow forever, not even us: see Lovelock).Natural selection also modifies instincts (e.g. geometrically perfect beehives), and through variations in their reproductive systems why different species can’t procreate with one another (and if they do, their offspring is sterile)"

322,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,4,"Charles Darwin’s work has fanned out to round about every corner of the world, his work entrenched in every naturalist, scientist and biologist of our time, with his writings and findings written in almost every curriculum taught to undergraduate and postgraduate students studying life sciences. Which was my first encounter in Charles Darwin and all he and his work was about - Darwin’s finches, natural selection, evolution over time and his revolutionary voyage on the HMS Beagle was in just about every genetics module and evolution base modules I was taught. I’ve been encountering snippets of his work all throughout my studies, a quote here, an excerpt there and thought it was about time I go straight to the source and read On the Origin of Species. It’s such an original, a legend in its own right in its revolutionary reports and observations. I find it quite frankly amazing how much this amazing man deduced and discovered considering it was during a time when many of the scientific discoveries we have come to know now as common knowledge (like DNA) were unheard of back then. I’m glad I finally got round the reading the writings of the man who shaped our world in so many ways with the science he produced in this book. I feel like I can call myself a scientist and a science lover now that I’ve read these writings that’s at the heart of our genetics and evolutionary knowledge, providing the foundations to springboard into our current age of scientific enlightenment and discovery!"

In the twenty-first century, this book should not be read for the science it. Darwin didn’t know mutations, he didn’t even know Mendel’s Laws! The important thing about this book is the change of world view it brought: we, humans, are not special! This story is not about us! In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us: we became self aware only to realize we are not protagonists. We are not on the top of the evolutionary scale, we are not more perfect than other living beings. This story began much before us and will probably end long after us. “Origin” helped us realize that.Darwin was a man ahead of his time, and I admire him greatly.Excellent read! "
324,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334545-david-s-t,3,"I figured while I was on my evolution book kick, I might as well go back to the original (well sort of the original, Alfred Russel Wallace published a paper on natural selection which prompted Darwin to publish this “abstract”). Now that I'm finished I feel two different ways about the book, a loved yet bored type of feeling. First I'm amazed at just how much of Darwin's theories and ideas are accurate and accepted even today 150 years later (which is a pretty darn long time in science). One thing you have to appreciate about this book is that its pretty evident that Darwin didn't just rush out and publish this theories but thought about every possible question everyone could have and he attempts to answer them all. Another question he spends a lot of time on is how flora could make it to islands, he goes through page after page of experiments trying to see how long seeds can stay in salt water and still germinate. Even better way back 150 years ago Darwin already anticipated the irreducible complexity argument of the eye and proposed his own ideas about how the eye could evolve and how each gradation is useful in itself. Some times the prose was pretty amazing, I think the famous line about “There is grandeur in this view of life.....” is one of my favorites in any book I've read.So as amazing as some parts where why then did I rate it 3 stars? Well for every amazing part there are page after page of material which is (to me) just plain boring. The prose which is great in sections is pretty tedious in other parts. The fact that he thought of every question means that he goes over proof after proof. Remember the salt water and the seeds mentioned above, well its cool at first but 40 pages of his experiments makes me start to care less and less. There were also a few parts which he got wrong, he spends a whole section trying to figure out why certain animals can't cross breed, something which is quickly addressed now days with DNA. I think at another part he denies that there ever were any mass extinctions (something we know happened several times in the earth's history). Another thing which made the book a little harder for me is Darwin mentions lots of people and animals I've never heard of, of course a better reader would have spend time looking them up but I just read on, I guess I didn't care enough to do that much research for the book. So overall for importance I'd rate this book a 5/5, but I have to factor in enjoyment and I so its gets the lower score. Truthfully this book is 150 years old and written in Victorian English, its very important, but there are better books on evolution out there, so if you're curious about the fascinating world of evolution, start elsewhere, only if you're curious about how the theory got started pick this one up.

325,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"I've probably listened to and rated over 15 books about evolution over the last two years, but I was always hesitant to read the granddaddy of them all. I should not have been and am glad I did for the following reasons,1) The book reads as well as any of the good popular science books available on audible. It is written as if his attended audience is for a 13 year old. That's how good of a writer Darwin is.2) I had obtained a google book version, but couldn't bring myself to read it, and I had obtained a free audio version floating around the net, but this audio version is professionally read and doesn't suffer at all from the narrator.3) The book lays out a very complicated argument in 13 basically independent chapters. Each chapter by itself is enough to convince the listener of the fact of evolution by natural selection. The author is very smooth at telling you what he's going to tell you, then tell you, and then explain to you what he has just told you.4) The book is a guidebook on how to lay out an argument and convince others to your viewpoint. He makes sure that he fairly presents criticism that could attack his theory and refutes it masterfully.5) My favorite reason for having read this book is that my smugness index has gone up. When I come across people who haven't read the book and deny the scientific fact of evolution I can now say that I have listened to the book and smugly add statements like ""even a thirteen year old can understand evolution, haven't you even read 'On the Origin of Species'""."
326,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13657916-jessi-roesner,4,"I'm rounding up a star or two for the experience of reading one of the most important books in history. In all honesty, this one was a challenge to get through at times -- often tedious in the sheer amount of detail, and the frequent repetition and reiteration of key arguments. I wish it had been about half as long, but I'm glad to be able to say I've read it. All that said, this book is a tour de force. The mark of a good theory is that it seems blatantly obvious in retrospect. I often had to remind myself what a revolutionary idea this was at the time, and yet the strength of Darwin's argument is overwhelming. The breadth and depth of his knowledge and research is also astonishing -- from talking about crossbreeds of plants I've never even heard of, to laying out the specific geological conditions under which fossils can be formed. It's hard to believe that he was able to lay out this theory well before the discovery of Mendelian inheritance (let alone DNA) and Pangea. The fact that he was able to come up with this elegant explanation of the origin of species without that knowledge, and still make such a compelling argument for it, is so impressive. ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."""

No wonder Darwin set the world on edge in the most damning way possible, quietly and thoughtfully with these soft-spoken facts."
330,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"So this is the foundation of the theory of evolution. No, Darwin was not the first or only one with musings much like the ones described in this book, but he took some other people's theories (incl. that of his own grandfather) and took them further or perfected them.After having spent 5 years on the Beagle and thus seeing all kinds of places, Darwin had returned to England. It would be many years before he published this book but during the last stretch of the journey, Darwin had discovered something along some of the specimen he had collected on the Galápagos Islands. No, it was not his famous finches. Those he had forgotten (or not known) to label, thus no longer knowing which bird came from which of the islands. It was also not the famous tortoises as every single one of the ones taken on board the Beagle had been eaten and the shell been thrown overboard.Luckily, there were still the mockingbirds. And like all animals on the Galápagos, they too were different on every island and he HAD labelled them.Thus, he saw that while they were all mockingbirds, they had slight differences, especially when it came to their beaks, which gave him the idea of them being specialized to the life conditions on their respective island.It was also the Galápagos Islands that gave him the idea of volcanic activity birthing an island. He just didn't know about plate tectonics yet, sadly, as that theory was only established (and proven) about 100 years later.Thus, he talks of evolution as nature's way of selecting traits most suited for whatever life a creature lives. He talks about sexual selection and extinction of animals.Think back to those times: mankind thought themselves the master of the Earth, as God had willed it. God, the omnipotent being, had created all things. Evolution, therefore, was blasphemy as it meant God either at least changing his mind or having made mistakes. You can imagine how some people reacted once this book had been written and published.However, while reading this book, I was delighted to see that Darwin never bashed religious people but simply didn't talk about religion at all. Maybe he had learned not to broach the subject since he was married to a Catholic. *lol* Instead, he simply laid out his theory and his reasons for having established it, giving ample proof while listing the single steps. And whenever there was a gap, he would address it and explain why it was there, what the likely answer was and, again, why.I was astonished and more than pleased to see how he had written this book. Much like in his journal about the voyage on the Beagle, he shows a beautiful writing style and wrote this book not only for scholars but - and this was radical as well - for the layman to understand. A complex and new concept explained in a simple way to make the science accessible.Like when he talked about humans breeding dogs to be of a certain size and character traits or gardeners crossing different flowers to get certain petal shapes and colours.He took Humboldt's ""web of life"" and transformed it into his famous ""tree of life"". There were a few minor errors (we know now) but all in all, his logic was sound - only limited, sometimes, by some thing or other that hadn't yet been discovered or explained. My hardcover edition had beautiful illustrations. Some were Darwin's sketches, other were oil paintings of animals he was talking about in the book. However, much like with the other book, there is an audio version narrated by Dawkins that is really very good despite being abridged.Where humankind would be without Darwin and this book, I do not know. We owe Darwin and his work a lot, though, that's for sure."
331,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92443064-andra,0,"It is difficult to rate this, as Charles Darwin is evidently not a writer. His work and theories, however, I find genius."
332,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477945-kendall,5,"Finally re-read after decades of good intentions. For a recondite classic it is full of surprises, mostly pleasant; its supposed impenetrability largely confined to parts we already knew were directed at specialists—I admit to slogging through the section on barnacles, for example. But Origins is highly readable, pleasurable even, almost in the way of an Edmund Wilson essay. Darwin proceeds deliberately through the mountain of evidence he collected over twenty years as he constructs a virtually unassailable intellectual structure. Freely recognizing arguments against natural selection—the central thread of the book—he gives his best arguments based on the knowledge of his day while carefully pointing out its limitations. I was not prepared for how well he anticipated later discoveries—Mendel’s pioneering work in genetics didn’t see publication until the early 20th century yet dovetails almost seamlessly into Origins exposition, as does the Modern Synthesis. If you’re interested in any of the broad fields of biology-evolution, taxonomy, genetics—The Origin of Species is a must read. If you are a creationist, even in its deceptive guise of intelligent design, you are not intellectually honest if you have not read and honestly come to grips with this book; which gives the lie to the railings of a few misguided Christians and Muslims who seem to think it a product of their devil. Yet, so thoughtful and measured a book makes it clear any devils are in the eye of the beholder. "
333,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,4,"In reading The Origin of Species, one of the things I found myself respecting most about Charles Darwin was his aversion to dogma, religious or otherwise. He was generally logical, reasonable, and slow to jump to conclusions, and it seems to me that the enduring quality of this book owes much to these traits in its author. 
""From these and similar considerations, but chiefly from our ignorance of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United States; and from the revolution in our palæontological ideas on many points, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected, it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of organic beings throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its productions.""
"
334,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13229843-ben-batchelder,1,"Charles Darwin’s “The Origin of Species” promises a lot. A back cover blurb says, “Next to the Bible no work has been quite as influential....” I’m not a scientist, but with a build up like that I had to give it a try after enjoying “The Voyage of the Beagle” (reviewed 9/5/13).It is a slog of a read, yet Darwin’s enthusiasm for his subject, the excitement he conveys in outlining the work of his lifetime and popularizing a scientific movement, are palpable. Ironically, Darwin was not a scientist himself, but a “naturalist,” whose first job in the field – to be the Beagle’s naturalist-on-board – was a bit of a lark, suggested by friends, after his prior path to becoming an Anglican pastor (his father’s preference) came to naught.His insights – not entirely original, as he really consolidated lines of thinking going on for several generations – stemmed not only from his visit to the Galapagos Islands on the Beagle, but from observing man-driven selection in the breeding of domesticated animals.  I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man’s power of selection. But the expression...Survival of the Fittest is more accurate...” (p.61) Yet the problems start right away. As Creationist Kent Hovind has pointed out, the assumption that natural selection causes evolution is problematic, for “natural selection” never creates, it only selects. Furthermore, “survival of the fittest” is a tautology, for by definition the fit survive and the survivors are fit. As Hovind points out, natural selection might be more clearly called differential reproduction, that is, some reproduce more than others.And what drove Darwin to this line of thinking? It turns out he was a Malthusian, the Chicken Little of his time:It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them. (p. 63) The implication being, for some to live, others must die. Death, then, turns out to be the selection method of the Universe, in the never-ending struggle to survive. Or, as he succinctly states, “Thus, extinction and natural selection go hand in hand.” (p.161)Sensing how grim his outlook might appear, Darwin tries to pre-empt: When we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply. (p.75) Call it the theory of Happy Death then, one of many assertions that don’t ring true. No fear is felt? Death is generally prompt? Well, then, bring on more of this necessary (per Malthus) and creative force!Elevating nature to a Capitalized Power, Darwin characterizes it as less selfish than we: “Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends.” (p.79)Around this part of the book came the first of many mentions (that I noticed) of the phrase “scale of nature,” which of course is a direct descendent of Plato’s and Aristotle’s Scala Naturae, showing a direct link to the pagan concept of a hierarchy of development that was transformed into the the Great Chain of Being by the Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century. This pagan belief in a hierarcy of more and less developed beings may have influenced Darwin’s unfortunate choice of sub-title: “By Means of Natural Selection of the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.” It is difficult to find a modern edition of the book that hasn’t scrubbed clean this evidence of Darwin’s easy racism. (Only in my 150th Anniversary Edition, from Signet Classics in 2003, could I find the sub-title in any edition on-line – tucked away in a title page inside.) One can see why Darwin’s boosters try to re-write history, for the sub-title’s “favoured races” helps explain how Social Darwinism – only disavowed by evolution’s supporters after the horrors of WWII – created so much havoc in the 20th century. (Marx and Stalin were nominally Christian before reading Darwin; both Stalin and Hitler appropriated Darwin for their perverted, murderous philosophies.)In terms of other influences, Darwin often refers to Charles Lyell and his (literally) ground-breaking “Principles of Geology” which, by positing long geological ages, gave breathing room for Darwin’s theory of numerous “slight variations” to evolve, of minuscule improvements multiplied over unimaginably many iterations. He goes so far as to warn skeptical readers:	He who can read Sir Charles Lyell’s grand work on the Principles of Geology...and yet does not admit how vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume. (p. 316) If you are detecting a certain stridency, you are not alone.And what was it that excited Darwin so much to dedicate his life to? Simply stated, it is the mechanism by which modifications occur within a species in response to environmental pressures. The same way that man could take the primordial wolf and encourage endless variations into hundreds of dog breeds, so could evolution (in what we would call today, micro-evolution) encourage those famous finches of Galapagos Islands to vary in beak sizes in adaptation to micro-environments.But Darwin wishes to go much further than that. In fact, he seems to indulge in frequent straw man arguments, saying that “special creation” would have no explanation for the facts he marshals, as though his critics assert dogs could only have been independently created at the beginning of time.Perhaps something like this was the prevailing wisdom at the time – that no species, or what we might call sub-species today, could develop into another. Yet, to contemporary ears, he doth protest too much.In fact, he takes his valuable insights and then extrapolates them to incredible lengths. (The theory of evolution remains just that, a theory, rather than the supreme law as treated by so many moderns.) His animation takes wing with passages such as this:	It is a truly wonderful fact – the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity – that all animal and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other... (p. 126) After long dancing around the controversial bush of his own creation, by book’s end he admits, “I believe that animals are descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or less number.” (p.502) But even here he prevaricates, for in the book’s last paragraph he triumphs, “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator [Nature?] into a few forms or into one...” (p.507) So which is it? Four or five or just one “form”? Either way, now we are really talking about Macro Evolution!Yet, sadly, not one concrete example – that has then or since been confirmed as a proven fact – is given of one species evolving into a wholly new one. (In fact, from our more modern understanding of mutations and how DNA works, mutations never allow for a gain in information, only its loss, which makes evolving from the simple ameoba to the incredibly complex human being patently impossible, the stuff of pure fantasy.)To his credit, Darwin brings up (what were at the time) the objections most “fatal,” or potentially fatal, to his theory. One was related to the fossil record, the other to how evolution could possibly explain for extremely complex organs which would have been useless when only partially created and, under the logic of the theory, would have been eradicated by natural selection long before completion.Let’s take the critical area of fossil evidence, or complete lack of it. Darwin readily admits there should be countless examples of intermediary forms (for example, showing how a reptile grew wings to become a bird), and asks:	Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely-graduated organic chain, and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory. (p.314) The reason, he answers back in 1859, is “that the geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect” (p.327), that is, we hadn’t dug up enough fossils yet.Jump ahead over 150 years, with numberless excavations and bones found all over the world, and there are still no such fossils. While there have been numerous hoaxes, including Piltdown Man, Nebraska Man, an the Archaeoraptor, or “dino-bird” – such is modern man’s obsession with trying to prove evolution – the lack of fossil record is a real brain-twister for evolutionists. As Colin Patterson, the late senior paleotogologist of the British Museum of Natural History, admitted, “there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.” (1979 letter to Luther D. Sutherland, cited in his “Darwin’s Enigma: Ebbing the Tide of Naturalism,” 1988, p. 89)The other big strike against evolution, forwarded by Darwin himself, was the feasibility of countless small evolutionary steps creating a complex organ which is all but worthless until whole. 	To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberation, could have been formed by natural selection seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. (p.172) His stab at explaining away the problem, as absurd as those by current apoligists, such as Richard Dawkins, is to find the tiniest benefit from even 100th of an eye which, multiplied over eons, brings us the remarkable present. For, “if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though unsuperable by our imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory.” (p.172) So something “unsuperable by our imagination’ should not be subversive to the theory?							 Yet, to my layman’s eyes, Darwin makes relatively few such categorical errors. Although DNA’s molecular structure would only be discovered nearly a century after the book’s launch, he rightly conjectures the inter-relatedness of all life, saying “that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking...” (p.437) as “the one known cause of close similarity in organic beings...” (p.432). Yes, it turns out all organisms were created with the same basic genetic code or language, known today as DNA.But he takes his conjectures to overwrought degrees, using morphology (the study of form and structure of organic beings) to imply all animals descend from the same ancestor (or two) and embryology to claim our ancient forms are revealed in early embryonic development. Among the many hoaxes used to try to confirm Darwin’s work, embryology as proof of evolution has, perhaps, the longest legs. Remember the Intro Biology chart which shows how the earliest human fetus has fish-like “gill slits” which proves that among our ancestors are dead fish? Or the one which supposedly demonstrates how all vertebrates look nearly identical soon after conception? Despite the drawings, originally from one Ernst Haeckel in 1874, having over a century ago been revealed as fakes, they still grace many biology textbooks.Much has changed since Darwin’s book was published, so we shouldn’t be too harsh on the man. You have to wonder, though, if Darwin were alive today and realized that fossil evidence still did not exist, would he be consistent and admit he went too far? (Today’s evolutionists have tried to explain away the lack of fossil record with a new theory, called punctuated equilibrium, or vast periods of no change followed by sudden and great leaps – hence the scarcity of fossils – but Darwin himself argues against it. (p.187))Darwin also believed in only a simple structure at the atom level, facilitating the idea that man could evolve from, say, an ameoba. But DNA has proven the opposite, that the number of genes within one human body of over 100 trillion equals the number of stars in 1,000 galaxies (of 100 billion stars each). We also now know that in mutations, the supposed engine of evolution, information is always lost and never gained.Knowing what we know today, would Darwin still believe in Darwinism?While his excitement in synthesizing a ground-breaking theory is palpable, did Darwin really need to macro-itize the obvious truth (in retrospect) of micro-evolution? It makes you wonder if there can be too much of a good thing. I recently read a review in the Wall Street Journal titled “The Ship of the Imagination” while pondering Darwin’s work. Rather breathlessly, the reviewer exults, “[the author] tracks other scientific efforts to achieve the apparently miraculous, including mind reading, the search for immortality, love potions, and the creation of demi-gods – or at least superhumans.” (Michael Saler, WSJ, 12/18/15) Could too much imagination be a bad thing?Since Darwin, science has become increasingly untethered from ethical considerations. Interestingly, as Vishal Mangalwadi pointed out in his magisterial “The Book That Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization,” no major new scientific laws have been formulated since in the last century following this untethering.Arguably, what we have now is less science than Scientism, where flawed theories such as Darwin’s have to be treated as the Law of the Land. The same Colin Patterson mentioned above searched for evolutionists who, out of the public glare, would stand up for evolution as we understand it today. Revealingly, from several such encounters he wrote:	I’ve tried putting a simple question to various people and groups of people. Question is: Can you tell me anything you about evolution, any one thing, that is true? I tried that question on the geology staff at the Field Museum of Natural History and the only answer I got was silence. I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary Morphology Seminar in the University of Chicago, a very prestigious body of evolutionists, and all I got there was silence for a long time and eventually one person said, “I do know one thing – it ought not be taught in high school.” (Cited in Stephen Jones, “Evolutionsm and Creationsim,” 11/5/82, p.1) Could it be that Darwin succumbed, too, to the vanity of his own imagination? And for how much longer must we carry him aloft?"

This has nothing to do with religion and humans are more a footnote. This is a biology book mostly about animals and natural selection. While this book talks a little about evolution, that's not really why it's important. I think some reviews and people focus too much on the history of this book rather than what is actually in this book. If you don't pick up the fact that Darwin was hugely into birds and they helped his studies, reread this book again. Every chapter he talks about some kind of bird and relates it to the primary subject. The controversy seems to have started by one little part in this book, but it's his other book where he talks about humans. He ignored humans for the most part because of Malthus.While this is an important read, this book gets boring if you're not interested in zoology or biology. I've said this before but I had ducks for three years, so I'm very interested in animal studies. I didn't really want to read this book before only because I knew my past self would find this boring. Just know what your about to read instead of thinking everyone needs to read this before they die."
336,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I’m doing a biology degree, and I’ve always been an admirer of (and a believer in) the theory of evolution through natural selection, so it seemed high time I finally went to hear it from the horse’s mouth. Not that Darwin came up with the idea out of nothing, of course; it was “in the air” at the time, and other scientists were thinking along similar lines — Lamarck and Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, to name just two. Not to mention, of course, Alfred Wallace, who could’ve beaten Darwin to publication.But Charles Darwin was the first to publish a theory which really made sense, which hung together and was testable. He may not have known about genetics or had a clear idea of how heritability occurs, yet it’s startling to read this and realise how close he was to right at times. He may not always have backed the right theories, but he considered everything he could imagine, and carefully related it to his own theory. It’s remarkable just how willing he was to consider where his theory might be wrong, and discuss those weaknesses. It’s also remarkable how often he tested what he could, whether it be the germination of seeds soaked in sea water or how pollination works; he may not have had the equipment that we have now, but his attitude is surely a lesson that every aspiring scientist should take to heart.Honestly, I don’t know how anyone can read this and come away without understanding Darwin’s theory. He’s painstakingly clear, at length, with examples. If you’re reading this and coming to the conclusion that he didn’t support the idea of one species evolving into another, “macroevolution”, your reading comprehension is at fault. He makes it quite clear that “microevolution”, small changes in existing species, can and will lead to new species.Darwin was not right about everything, but he was right in many key ways — and he would be the first to admit that he could be wrong. He gave us a working, testable theory, one which has ample proof both in his work and in the world around us. Creationists have far too much to explain, by comparison.Originally reviewed for breathesbooks.com."

""The Origin of the Species"", presented here in its full first edition format (because the next 5 editions of it were just more in depth renderings on the same subjects, with some response to subsequent criticism added on top) does not include a single page, line or speculation on the origin of man. That, Darwin left for another book - you guessed it - ""The Descent of Man"". I've been meaning to read Origin for a long time, and have finally gotten around to it, expecting to be impressed and have my curiosity satisfied. I am and it was. I won't talk here about the writing itself, because it truly is just a long form scientific paper detailing experiments and hypotheses, trials and tribulations and the knowledge Darwin and others had on the subject. But I will say this: when you're reading it, bear something in mind. Think about the nuclear bomb-like quality this book had at the time it was published in intellectual circles everywhere. Think about how it shook and shattered the foundations of a Church which had been in power for around 1800 years at that point. Imagine the heretical nature it must have had (as it has today) in the eyes of indoctrinated people. And then think about how easy it is today for schools to refuse teaching evolution because ""it offends"" them, because it's not the truth they want. A few men - Darwin included - have dedicated their lives to a truth that even they didn't like and believe to begin with; they struggled with their own findings; they hated that they couldn't find evidence that would be more in line with their beliefs from childhood. But they never let that stop them. And they have given us the foundation for entire fields of science, from which we benefit from this day, whether we choose to accept it or not. I tried to read Origins with the mentality of a mid 19th Century and 2018 individual at the same time... it's awesome from both vantage points. "

Charles Darwin is the prophet of the natural selection theory and the Godfather of the struggle for survival.Darwin's work ""On The Origin of Species"" gives you a feel at times that you're reading something between a textbook and a book. This book is a short summary of his Voyage and 15 years of studying and researching organisms prior to writing this book. On the other hand, Darwin gives us an extensive detailed elaboration of his theory of evolution by means of natural selection.I wish he could have wrote more with regards to the humankind Species, but it was a different time, and writing this book was probably risky in itself.He was such a humble gentleman that he dedicated big portions of his book to the possible difficulties with his theory.I've read the Serbo-Croatian translation Postanak Vrsta autora Čarlsa Darvina / Akademska Knjiga 2009 6th Edition Publishing / 573 pages / 158,662 words."

It would have to be included on any short list of 'classics of science'. I have docked a star to reflect the fact that it's not always easy reading - there's that verbose quality to its style that characterizes most writing from the Victorian era. That said, I should point out that ""The Origin of Species"" is completely understandable to any general reader willing to give it a careful reading. You don't have to be a biologist to follow Darwin's argument. Two aspects of the book are astonishing; both underscore the brilliance of Darwin's accomplishment. The first is just how right he got things; the second is that he managed to fit all the major pieces of the puzzle in place with no knowledge of the actual mechanics of heredity. Mendel's work on genetics adn the elucidation of the structure of DNA would subsequently flesh out the details of the scheme proposed by Darwin; one has to bear in mind the actual state of knowledge in Darwin's time, and the prevailing intellectual climate, to appreciate fully the revolutionary nature of his argument. Upon re-reading the book this past weekend, I was reminded of certain endearing aspects that I had forgotten. One is Darwin's willingness to point out, and try to answer, what he perceived as the potential weaknesses in his argument. This is another: ""Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have, after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons"". Not quite as glamorous as the beasties he got to see from The Beagle, but he's continually observing, gathering data from any source available, always asking questions. You gotta love this book. But you gotta read it to love it. "
340,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33352366-elari,5,"As I was going through the Origin of Species page on Goodreads, I decided to check some of the one-star reviews. What I mainly found was:a) Creationists who didn’t read the book, but nonetheless needed to assert that humans are not descended from apes.b) Confused readers complaining about some obnoxious character called Alex. Since it was improbable that Darwin had given pet names to any creature whether living or fossilized, I looked into this one further and realized that a rather bad Nino Ricci novel was merged with Darwin’s science book. What a shame, Goodreads.c) Other confused readers who decided to give Darwin a one-star rating because of Ray Comfort’s introduction, which I think is utterly unfair to Darwin, although utterly fair to Comfort. Bash - Creationism Suite No.1 - PreludeThe edition I first started reading has a certain Ray Comfort gift us a very Special Introduction. This Mister – who also turns out to be a Christian Minister – desperately struggles to install the idea of a supreme being into Darwin’s theory before the latter gets a chance to speak. Mister Comfort Zone elaborates on moronic arguments that would make God himself flush with embarrassment, only to arrive at the conclusion that the complexity of life as we know it could not have evolved by chance (synonymous with eco-biochemistry in the creationist dialect). The conclusion of the book’s introduction, then, unlike the conclusion of the book itself, is that The Origin of Species is intelligent design.I’m surprised that decontextualizing quotes from prominent scientists to make them fit into the Comfort Combat is not considered an intellectual property infringement. The fact that this edition made it to print instead of court is very telling. For its disgraceful attempt at spoiling a science book with bad writing, the introduction deserves no stars at all. It’s almost a shame that it isn’t featured on GoodReads separately, but I won’t give Darwin’s book a low rating on its account. I’ll just pick another edition. The Origin of SpeciesReading On The Origin of Species isn’t about being introduced to a theory you know nothing about. Anyone remotely interested in evolution will reach this book as the culmination of a long winding road of scientific discoveries. It is still a priceless read, because of the quality of research and of its presentation. I have yet to find a work of art as beautiful as this science book.Darwin isn’t humorous in his writing. He is grave, patient, and humble. He is, beyond any doubt, the most modest of all the scientists I have ever met or read. Consider this: “To arrive at a just conclusion regarding the formation of the eye, with all its marvelous but not absolutely perfect characters, it is indispensable that the reason should conquer the imagination; but I have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at others hesitating to extend the principle of natural selection to so startling a length.” Moreover, he is so meticulous and precise that my sapient brain could die of fulfillment. Every tiny detail attended to—and there are so many—makes the whole of my intelligence appear tinier and tinier. It is most incredible that Darwin had to rely on empirical data, having no access to (and indeed no knowledge of) the genetic material, the basis of hereditable mutations. This intuition is beyond my comprehension. How could one man foresee such an immense and intricate scheme of things despite the widely accepted, unquestionable doctrines of his time?Compulsory Postscript: Tim Minchin on Americans and Evolution."

After reading it, I whole-heartedly agree with the statement. Only when one reads Darwin's perspective on such topics as breeding, domestic speciation, migration, instinct, etc. does one come to fully realize how much this book ushered in a new age of modern thought. The Theory of Evolution is so pervasive in the mindset of today's world that only by reading the work can one understand how much of a statement Darwin was making by risking its publication. He very literally changed the world or, rather, told us how it had been changed.Within the book Darwin also makes many references to the ""beauty"" and ""wonder"" of nature, something that I found quite fascinating considering how many (or at least some) believe his works to be the antithesis of religious ideals. I gained a respect for Darwin's knowledge and love for the natural world that surrounds us, and there is no question that his words caused me to appreciate nature in both a scientific and spiritual sense. As my opening quote demonstrates, you owe it to yourself to read this book. It changed the way mankind viewed the planet, their relationship with it and, indeed, their relationship with their very origins. ""There is grandeur in this view of life..."""

A banned book.I can't rate this book honestly because I tend to rate books based on my feelings and I just can't rate this fundamental for science book the one star my feelings demand. Because reading this is pure torture. I've studied Dawrin's theory so I was interested in the way he came up to those conclusions. I was pretty surprised that he even managed to do it considering how much he didn't know back then. But the way the book was written... I won't lie it's a great sleeping aid. The repetitions and multiple examples for the same thing must have been crucial for convincing people back then but made me scream. I hate evolutionary genetics because for some reason I find it extremely boring. Still this is one of the pillars of today's biology so as a biologist I had to read it. But if you want to actually learn about Darwin's theory go find a biology textbook - it's explained much better. Or rather it's explained without all the boring details.

However, in the last chapter, he takes his time to briefly explain to us everything he has taught us during his works, in order to makes us perceive the wonderful struggle for existence surrounding us.The book makes you feel something like ""you deserve to be amazing, because life took such a contrivance to conceive you""."

We see indefinite variability in the endless slight peculiarities which distinguish the individuals of the same species, and which cannot be accounted for by inheritance from either parent or from some more remote ancestor."" OK, then! On to Chap. 1: ""When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of character than in true species. Domestic races often have a somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although differing from each other and from other species of the same genus, in several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part..."" Less turgid, but still pretty tough sledding, at least for me. Trying Chap 2: ""I am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the cases of variability, even in important parts of structure, which he could collect on good authority, as I have collected, during a course of years. It should be remembered that systematists are far from being pleased at finding variability in important characters, and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs, and compare them in many specimens of the same species.""OK.

Darwin was unusually reflexive and tempered in his writing, probably owing at least in part to the heavy disapproval he know he would encounter from everyone from the clergy to other scientists, but props to him for writing in a way that is at once confident and humble. Reading this after Feyerabend's Against Method, the major thing I took away from it was that science should always leave itself open to the consideration of new theories, even if those theories contradict the logical systems that presently reign. In the case of Darwin, it is utterly apparent (to me) that Natural Selection is an ethical and valuable creation myth that opens the field of scientific inquiry to an untold number of fresh possibilities. That it was abused by so-called social Darwinists and other politically motivated actors only reinforces my feeling that the ethical implications of all scientific theory should be subjected to at least as much rigor as data, methodology, and repeatability.Finally, Darwin uses awesome examples of strange animals."

But even from a strictly layperson's view, there are a number of things about The Origin of Species that greatly impressed me.His careful observations. It is obvious that he cared deeply about his work. He had made careful observations and comparisons about many species, both plants and animals. It is quite clear that he passionately loved nature.""He must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a [honey]comb, so beautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration.His elegant use of language. While the target audience of The Origin was his fellow scientists, he wrote clearly and plainly enough that a non-scientist could follow the main points of his argument. At the same time, there is a beauty and elegance in his use of language:""... it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts... not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.""His humility. He openly admitted the weak points of his theory - in fact, there is an entire chapter entitled ""Difficulties on Theory."" In addition, he gave credit to other scientists for their contributions to both his and their own fields of research. And yet, he doesn't back down in the face of objections. Consider this emphatic statement concerning geologic time:""He who can read Sir Charles Lyell's grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future historian will recognize as having produced a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how incomprehensibly vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume."" The fact that Darwin reached his conclusions from observation and experiment before the birth of modern genetics is even more remarkable. His postulation  ...that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other... has certainly been proven true by modern DNA evidence.It goes without saying that a considerable amount of his work has been superseded with newer and more accurate findings. Mr. Darwin died before the development of the theories of continental drift and plate tectonics. While reading this, I couldn't help thinking how amazed he would be if he were able to see all of today's various fields of science, especially DNA research. ""The whole history of the world, as at present known, although of a length quite incomprehensible by us, will hereafter be recognized as a mere fragment of time, compared with the ages which have lapsed since the first creature, the progenitor of innnumerable extinct and living descendants, was created. In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches.""Now for the criticism. Mr. Darwin tends to repeat himself. Perhaps he did this on purpose to reiterate his position. I confess, I skimmed the final chapter titled ""Recapitulation and Conclusion."" Also, as has been often noted, Darwin was in a rush to publish and omitted quite a lot of data that supported his conclusions. As Thomas Henry Huxley said about The Origin of Species:...a sort of intellectual pemmican - a mass of facts crushed and pounded into shape, rather than held together by the ordinary medium of an obvious logical bond...Again, for sheer want of room, much has to be taken for granted which might readily enough be proved... the novice in biology is apt to complain of the frequency of what he fancies is gratuitous assumption .(Yet, in spite of those rather harsh words, Huxley was one of the most vocal and vehement supporters of Darwin's theory, becoming known as ""Darwin's Bulldog."")"

It is an absolute triumph of empirical evidence based science. By the most constant and careful observation of the natural world Darwin not only worked out the theory of evolution he also quite correctly realised that all life forms on this planet are related to one another, ""by which all living and extinct beings are united by complex,radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand system""The first two chapters and the last chapter are where the general reader can feel the sparkle of Darwin's ideas and his profound infatuation with nature and its works. These chapters are also the best written and not surprisingly are a thrilling rush of theory and ideas.The vast bulk of the work is the minutiae of his ideas. It is, I have to say, cumbersome to read. It is the sort of sub clausal slog that a lot of nineteenth century writing gets bogged down in. Darwin's modesty in quoting and attributing to others and his unfailing scientific fearlessness in saying 'OK here is where my theory falls over' makes him a figure of unimpeachable scientific integrity.After reading this book I can understand the affection and respect that Darwin has been held in by those who try to base their lives in reason and science."

Definitely 5/5.Darwin's theory in a nutshell: Nature selects organisms with certain features (variations) to pass on their traits that help them survive (against competition – for food, shelter, mates – the environment and predators), forming different species (descendants with modification from a common ancestor) over many generations. Other factors that contribute to natural selection: diversification, living conditions, disuse of body parts. The species that can’t develop such traits eventually go extinct because nature keeps populations in balance (no population can grow forever, not even us: see Lovelock).Natural selection also modifies instincts (e.g. geometrically perfect beehives), and through variations in their reproductive systems why different species can’t procreate with one another (and if they do, their offspring is sterile)"

The important thing about this book is the change of world view it brought: we, humans, are not special! This story is not about us! In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us: we became self aware only to realize we are not protagonists. We are not on the top of the evolutionary scale, we are not more perfect than other living beings. This story began much before us and will probably end long after us. “Origin” helped us realize that.Darwin was a man ahead of his time, and I admire him greatly.Excellent read! "

Now that I'm finished I feel two different ways about the book, a loved yet bored type of feeling. First I'm amazed at just how much of Darwin's theories and ideas are accurate and accepted even today 150 years later (which is a pretty darn long time in science). One thing you have to appreciate about this book is that its pretty evident that Darwin didn't just rush out and publish this theories but thought about every possible question everyone could have and he attempts to answer them all. Another question he spends a lot of time on is how flora could make it to islands, he goes through page after page of experiments trying to see how long seeds can stay in salt water and still germinate. Even better way back 150 years ago Darwin already anticipated the irreducible complexity argument of the eye and proposed his own ideas about how the eye could evolve and how each gradation is useful in itself. Some times the prose was pretty amazing, I think the famous line about “There is grandeur in this view of life.....” is one of my favorites in any book I've read.So as amazing as some parts where why then did I rate it 3 stars? Well for every amazing part there are page after page of material which is (to me) just plain boring. The prose which is great in sections is pretty tedious in other parts. The fact that he thought of every question means that he goes over proof after proof. Remember the salt water and the seeds mentioned above, well its cool at first but 40 pages of his experiments makes me start to care less and less. There were also a few parts which he got wrong, he spends a whole section trying to figure out why certain animals can't cross breed, something which is quickly addressed now days with DNA. I think at another part he denies that there ever were any mass extinctions (something we know happened several times in the earth's history). Another thing which made the book a little harder for me is Darwin mentions lots of people and animals I've never heard of, of course a better reader would have spend time looking them up but I just read on, I guess I didn't care enough to do that much research for the book. So overall for importance I'd rate this book a 5/5, but I have to factor in enjoyment and I so its gets the lower score. Truthfully this book is 150 years old and written in Victorian English, its very important, but there are better books on evolution out there, so if you're curious about the fascinating world of evolution, start elsewhere, only if you're curious about how the theory got started pick this one up.

I should not have been and am glad I did for the following reasons,1) The book reads as well as any of the good popular science books available on audible. It is written as if his attended audience is for a 13 year old. That's how good of a writer Darwin is.2) I had obtained a google book version, but couldn't bring myself to read it, and I had obtained a free audio version floating around the net, but this audio version is professionally read and doesn't suffer at all from the narrator.3) The book lays out a very complicated argument in 13 basically independent chapters. Each chapter by itself is enough to convince the listener of the fact of evolution by natural selection. The author is very smooth at telling you what he's going to tell you, then tell you, and then explain to you what he has just told you.4) The book is a guidebook on how to lay out an argument and convince others to your viewpoint. He makes sure that he fairly presents criticism that could attack his theory and refutes it masterfully.5) My favorite reason for having read this book is that my smugness index has gone up. When I come across people who haven't read the book and deny the scientific fact of evolution I can now say that I have listened to the book and smugly add statements like ""even a thirteen year old can understand evolution, haven't you even read 'On the Origin of Species'""."

In all honesty, this one was a challenge to get through at times -- often tedious in the sheer amount of detail, and the frequent repetition and reiteration of key arguments. I wish it had been about half as long, but I'm glad to be able to say I've read it. All that said, this book is a tour de force. The mark of a good theory is that it seems blatantly obvious in retrospect. I often had to remind myself what a revolutionary idea this was at the time, and yet the strength of Darwin's argument is overwhelming. The breadth and depth of his knowledge and research is also astonishing -- from talking about crossbreeds of plants I've never even heard of, to laying out the specific geological conditions under which fossils can be formed. It's hard to believe that he was able to lay out this theory well before the discovery of Mendelian inheritance (let alone DNA) and Pangea. The fact that he was able to come up with this elegant explanation of the origin of species without that knowledge, and still make such a compelling argument for it, is so impressive. ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."""
357,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1336573-charles,5,"Every scientist should read this book. Especially the first and second editions. It's actually surprisingly well written, with doses of wry humor here and there. But it's main strength is just the insight into a brilliant mind at work. There can be no better lesson for someone intersted in a career in science."
358,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,5,"Expectations high because of its reputation, I found the book slow-paced and quite boring. Not a word about human evolution! Darwin was no Dawkins in terms of wording and pacing, but this book led to a major paradigm shift in human thought. Its enormous impact cannot be disputed."
359,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51089-jamie,4,"To be completely honest, I wanted the notch on my belt for this one. Which didn’t hinder it from being interesting to read. No wonder Darwin set the world on edge in the most damning way possible, quietly and thoughtfully with these soft-spoken facts."
