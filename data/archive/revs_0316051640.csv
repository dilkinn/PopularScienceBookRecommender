0,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,4,"Stop the search. Recall the teams. I have found the non-fiction, summer read of 2010! The Disappearing Spoon.First, what’s a summer read, Mr. Josey Wales thumbnail photo? A summer read is one you can enjoy during a vacation to the beach, with fresh cocktails and clean towels provided by the swarthy, bronzed attendant at a seafront hotel. You can finish it in a few days in bite-sized chunks, it doesn’t overpower you academically, you learn a little, and the subject is something entirely new to you, which allows you to ‘escape’ mentally just as you are physically from that 50-hour, weekly cubicle career and hateful commuter traffic.The book catalogues the 200 year history of the piecemeal development of the periodic table in chemistry. Wait, this is not your high school chemistry class! Sam Kean uses the most idiosyncratic, unusual, serendipitous, and funny events to tell this story. You learn as much about the brilliant, boisterous, bi-polar, bastardly, and braggadocio scientists as you learn about each element on the periodic table. Each of 19 chapters pulls together several periodic elements and outlines their unexpected similarity and relatedness--atomically, quantumly and culturally. And the narrative moves fluidly back and forth through time to capture the relevant history of each element. The book highlights discoveries that are still being made, current as of late 2009.Strontium, Molybdenum, Ruthenium, Francium, Ytterbium. Neptunium, Berkelium, Californium, Lawrencium. What are you all about? How were you discovered? Why are you so important? And why the heck are you so rare? This is neat science told in a fun and effervescent way. There are some awesome, awe-inspiring, and yet sometimes pedestrian, elements out there. Science ofttimes moves forward in jumps and spurts, and Kean is quick to relate how it moves chaotically, unexpectedly, bizarrely, and accidentally. The author reviews not just core chemistry but also history, physics, cosmology, and psychology. The scientists and their Rube Goldberg experiments are as interesting as the results. Periodic elements are really cool (yes, I actually said that). They’re phenomenal, toxic, powerful, rare, ephemeral, magical, radioactive, and have the most interesting relationships to each other. We’re told why, when, and how they’ve been used and abused through history, and how they shepherded great leaps in the advancement of human civilization.The Disappearing Spoon is quick, light reading out in the sun. It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way. Kean uses good rhythm in the book, chapters of uniform length, and a bit of humor to bring it all home. He pulls it off effectively--Mr Wizard meets chaos theory. Sixth grade, mall, ‘wow’-science is discussed right next to the paragraph about how to produce absolute zero or 35 million degrees, both of which, incidentally, are created by lasers.In the end, you’ll learn a little, laugh a little. You may not remember anything from this book 2 years from now, but you will retain this: elements are neat as hell, and thank goodness for chemists and physicists. New words: depilatory, eluted"
1,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,0,"My GR friend Jason writes sturdy and trustworthy reviews, but I must take exception with him here :The Disappearing Spoon is quick, light reading out in the sun. It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way.Yes, it is all that, IF such stuff as this makes sense to you :The strongest solo acid is still the boron-based carborane (HCB11C111) And this boron acid has the best punchline so far : it's simultaneously the world's strongest and gentlest acid. To wrap your head around that, remember that acids split into positive and negative parts. In carborane's case you get H+ and an elaborate cagelike structure formed by everything else (CB11C111-) With most acids it's the negative portion that's corrosive and caustic and eats through the skin. But the boron cage forms one of the most stable molecules ever invented. Its boron atoms share electrons so generously that it practically becomes helium, and it won't go around ripping electrons from other atoms, the usual cause of acidic carnage.Well, this could be part of the rules of Quidditch for all the sense it makes to poor general reader me, so I think The Disappearing Spoon is really for science geeks who think stuff about German chemists being hornswoggled out of a Nobel Prize for Alchemy by some Californian sharpies in 1951 or a neat account of the crucial properties of the biomolecule which are called handedness is the very thing for those moments on the beach when there isn't any eye candy around."
2,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3504278-kate,4,"Okay. Let me tell it to you honestly.This book is not the most well written book - the sentences are clunky and there is not a clear narrative. It is much more of a rambling collection of stories and facts and quirky science knowledge.That said, I couldn't get back to reading this fast enough. I thought about a book about the scientific table throughout the day. I stole a few minutes wherever I could. I carried this book with me and was even *gasp* early to pick up the kids so that I could read a few minutes in the car.I mean, the opening factoid is about our ability to trace Lewis & Clark's trail by following the mercury laced poop trail. I love that shit. Growing up, I never loved science. I didn't learn the periodic table in school like others did. And so, there were times in this book, where I only understood a few clauses in each paragraph because the concepts were so advanced, but the author did a great job of bringing it back to a laypersons' comprehension in the next paragraph. So, in summary, this book is written for all levels of science (or not) nerds. It is full of incredible tales and the fun secrets and stories of the people involved in the development of the periodic table (and science as we know it).I will absolutely be rereading this book - most definitely when the boys are learning the periodic table in school."
3,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,4,"This is an absolutely brilliant idea for a book and it’s a superb book. It’s beautifully organized and well written. It’s a wonderful way to learn and/or deepen knowledge of chemistry. This book is fine for laypeople, but will give meaning and extra enjoyment even for advanced chemistry students. Much appreciated by me was that the information imparted was over my head only a very few times, and that’s saying a lot, because I’ve never taken a chemistry class.This book covers the elements of the periodic table via its history and by telling stories about the various elements: their history of discovery, how they’ve been used at various times, various people who found ways to make use of them. Anyone with a smidgen of curiosity about any aspect of life should find many things here that they find interesting. So many subjects are covered including astronomy, war, South Pole exploration, health and illness and poisoning, history, other sciences, the personalities of those who have contributed to the findings in the field, and so much more. It’s jam packed with useful facts and enjoyable stories. The relevance of the elements (chemistry) in everyday life is made so clear.There are many lovely digressions that turn out not to be digressions at all. There were very amusing parts, including funny quips that frequently pop up, and all of those quips have substance. It has a sort of gossipy (in a good way) tone. I learned so much. I found out that I love Linus Pauling and many other scientists who’ve contributed to the field. I was surprised how much of what’s been discovered in the field of chemistry has been done fairly recently, and how it’s still a growing, living scientific endeavor. While I’ve always been interested in science, and I did want a chemistry set when I was a child (request denied), I knew deplorably little about chemistry. Like the author, I loved playing with growing balls of mercury from broken thermometers. Quite a few of the elements themselves were, of course, familiar to me, but I didn’t know much about them. I had a bit of chemistry in other college science classes and in nutrition class. As I read, I frequently wished I’d memorized the table before reading this book. There is a table of the elements in the back of the book but it includes abbreviations only; it is not embellished; there is no list of elements by name next to it. However, in the index, thankfully, the elements are listed in bold, and I referred to that index at the beginning of every chapter when some elements were listed, in what looked to me like unusual Scrabble tiles. I read the notes as I read along, and they were easy to find because they started with page number and beginning of phrase in bold as a match their section in the book, but I’d still rather they’d have been included in the text proper to make the information even easier to read and to make it flow more smoothly.This book should be part of every beginning chemistry class. It makes the subject so interesting. This is certainly not the only attempt to make chemistry a great deal of fun for everyone. The book mentions the Tom Lehrer song, The Elements (which can be seen in many places including here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYW50F...).I really enjoyed this book, although I did end up reading it slowly, and I did take one break to read the young adult novel Mockingjay, which I’d been waiting to read for nearly a year.This is a gem of a book and such a great idea. I adored the humor, and there was a lot of it. I’ll let readers see for themselves why the book’s title is what it is.I hope that Sam Kean (or someone) writes similar books about physics, mathematics, etc. etc. I would definitely read them if they were as clever as this book."
4,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28470777-mackey,5,"This is on the banned book list - why!? Oh that's right. Certain parents think that science is too ""real"" for their precious babies. What a lot of baloney! The Disappearing Spoon is, quite literally, one of the most fascinating, informative, FUNNY, books about the Periodic Table that I've ever read. Okay, it is the only book about the Periodic Table that I've ever read - but it is amazing. For those who love science or for those who simply would like to better under the elements that make the cosmos what it is, then this is a must read for you!! As for the ""disappearing spoon"" trick - well, you'll just have to read the book to find out the secret to this parlor trick for yourself! You'll be glad that you did! "
5,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"There's a certain type of goodreads troll -- the one who defends their beloved book by saying something like, ""Well, if you knew the topic didn't interest you why were you stupid enough to pick up the book?"" To that goodreads troll I now have an answer: this book.If you had told me a few weeks ago that I'd find a book about chemistry and the periodic table of elements difficult to put down, I'd have had a hard time believing you. But I did. This book was funny, interesting, even gripping at times, and always engaging. I took off a star because I'll admit that I didn't get all of it despite the author's best efforts. I guess it would take more than a fun book to turn me into a chemistry person. But it was still a wonderful read, and not a guilty pleasure because it was actually educational. This meant I could feel virtuous for once while I ignored my various responsibilities in favor of more reading.So not only did I get to enjoy a good book, I feel vindicated in my ongoing belief that a a sufficiently good writer can make any topic interesting, even to a reluctant reader. Yes – sometimes it pays to leave your reading comfort zone. And when it doesn’t, you have every right to complain because it is about the book, not just about a personal bias with regard to the content. For a good book, there should be no such thing as a “right” or “wrong” reader."
6,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431873-emily,3,"This book took me 76 days, or almost three months, to read. In this case, I needed all seventy-six individual days to work my brain through passages like this one:
For instance, thirteen aluminium atoms grouped together in the right way do a killer bromine: the two entities are indistinguishable in chemical reactions. This happens despite the cluster being thirteen times larger than a single bromine atom and despite aluminium being nothing like the lacrimatory poison-gas staple ... The clusters work like this. The atoms arrange themselves into a three-dimensional polyhedron, and each atom in it mimics a proton and a neutron in a collective nucleus. The caveat is that electrons can flow around inside this soft nucleic blob, and the atoms share the electrons collectively. Scientists wryly call this state of matter ""jellium.""
All you need to know is that I'm sort of an idiot. If you read the above passage and thought, ""This makes perfect sense! What an appropriate way to explain jellium, a state I've always been interested in!"", then you are less of an idiot than me and will probably enjoy this book very much. To give more context, here's how much of an idiot I am: when I took physics at Stanford (on the way to my successful minor! ha!), I had a lot of trouble with electricity and optics. To study, I did literally every single problem from those chapters, and I did the word problems multiple times. When I got to the final, I immediately recognized one of the problems I had done at least four times, was jubilant for about 2 seconds, and then realized I had absolutely no idea how to do it. (I think I only got half credit.) That is how good I am at squashing scientific concepts into my brain. On the positive side, I find all of this very interesting, and because I forget it so quickly, I have a lifetime of renewed discoveries ahead of me."
7,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1159787-valerie,5,"This does for the periodic table what I am always trying to do for math....link the science to the historical events, the people, and the economics that push scientific discoveries. I was fascinated by the many details about the hunt for elements, the private lives of the Curies, the radioactive boy scout, the dangers of storing rare elements in the Congo, and that the same man who invented nitrogen rich fertilizers, is also the inventor of zyklon B. It also made me want to read more about The Manhattan Project, so I guess its time to put the Rhodes book on my wishlist."
8,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112699911-orhan-pelinkovic,4,"The spoon disappeared in a cup of tea as the spoon was made out of gallium that melts at 29°C - not my cup of tea. This book is rich in empirical evidence and interesting tales of the last 200 years of history and discoveries of the chemical elements of the periodic table. However, the countless stories lacked the threads that could have given them a common fabric.The periodic table, which is currently comprised of 118 elements (112 at the time the book was written), is an ongoing process. The number of elements in our 14 billion year old universe increased over time. Right after the Big Bang a couple of elements formed, but later through nuclear fusion in stars, and stellar explosions known as supernovas, created and released the other naturally occurring elements. The remaining elements in the periodic table are synthetic (woman-made / man-made). The book walks us through Mendeleev's periodic table of elements that is composed of the main ingredients that chemists, physicists, and other scientist use for their recipes and experiments. The author shares many amusing background stories on how numerous chemical elements were isolated and shaped the way wars were fought, politics conducted, and relationships impacted.We see how women, like Marie Skłodowska Curie, her daughter Irene, Lise Meitner, and others played a pivotal role in the evolution of the periodic table.The author also recognizes that science, as a whole, was greatly contributed by immigrants.Somewhere in the first quarter of the book an interesting question was asked by Kean and that is whether theory or experiments are responsible for the advancement of science? I wish this question was further elaborated. The reader will definitely walk away with a considerable amount of interesting information, but not enough understanding of the subject matter. The author spent almost the whole book informing, rather than teaching and challenging me to think. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting a tour of the chemical elements and their backstories.[I read the Montenegrin (Serbian / Croatian / Bosnian) translation Kašika koja nestaje - autor Sem Kin. Laguna 2018 Publishing / 459 pages / 111,901 words. Great translation.]"
9,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,2,"I should have liked this book more and I can't really explain why I didn't. It's not poorly written (though it ain't Solzhenitsyn) and it's not that uninteresting of a topic, but I just found that after the first 40ish pages, I dreaded having to read more. It was like pulling teeth, only a bit less painful, even without the option of novocaine.I think part of it was that the book wasn't well organized. The author seemed to jump around the periodic table at his whim without keeping a consistent framework (perhaps that was the point, it was a bit unclear to me). Anyway, the writing is OKish enough and it is certainly very well researched, so I can understand why many people have liked it. And it's really not a bad science book, but for some reason I just found myself having a viscerally negative reaction to having to read the next chapter (well I guess I didn't have to keep reading on, but whatever). I don't know, I wish I could pinpoint the source of my discontent with this, but it is what it is, so feel free to try it out for yourself."
10,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,4,"""Never underestimate spite as a motivator for genius.""I can't really speak to the scientific accuracy of this book, but I really enjoyed listening to the stories that come from the periodic table. I feel like I learned some things, which isn't that difficult of a feat since what I remember from my high school chemistry class has more to do with the people sitting near me (we called ourselves the Peanut Gallery). I have vague memories of a teacher, the great Thorstein Sabo, who tried to teach us about the periodic table by telling us stories about electrons playing cribbage in the electron hotel. I didn't really get it. This book groups different elements, and tells stories about them in context of political intrigue, devastating consequences, and lifesaving discoveries. Coincidentally, I am also reading Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age, a book with a lot of parallels to The Disappearing Spoon. Where The Disappearing Spoon demonstrates how war interrupts scientific process, Rites of Spring shows the same about war interfering in the arts. You have to wonder how much farther, or at least different, both science and the arts would be, had we never had the world wars consuming the first half of the twentieth century.The tiny pieces of information I didn't know would fill a book, this book. It would be impossible to even recite them, but I particularly enjoyed the story of argyria, silver poisoning, and the senate/governor hopeful who drank collodial silver in preparation for Y2K. Argyria turns your skin blue... permanently. Papa smurf!I also made a note to myself to check out the poet Lowell, who is one of the first people to be treated with Lithium for mental illness. Salt (not an element) was also put into perspective with Ghandi and enforced iodine and I just don't know whether to be grateful that my government is preventing birth defects or to be freaked out that they are adding things like iodine to salt and fluoride to the water. The audiobook was great for this. Sean Runnette has a unique voice that I enjoyed in zombie stories but still translated well to science!I will leave you with a song I could not get out of my head during my listen to the second half of the book."
11,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,3,"This book constipated my reading for almost a month. I have overdue fines from other books that were stacked up behind it. Not because I wasn't enjoying the book: it's readable, fascinating, and chock full of the very anecdotes about science and scientists that I love. So then, why the hell did I find this book so hard?It's precisely because the book is a collection of anecdotes that it was so hard to read. I felt like I was trying to grasp quicksilver (mercury, symbol Hg from Latin hydragyrum, meaning “water silver”) as this steady diet of atomic information arrived. Actually, that's a lousy metaphor: quicksilver is a glistening hypnotic liquid because its atoms stick together. These atomic anecdotes didn't: nothing stuck in my head, nothing stuck to each other. There was no overall organizing principle to the book that I could divine, and reluctantly I finished it barely the wiser than I begun.This book demands flashcards. I want to know the anecdotes. I want them to stick. I am going to have to work at it, however, beyond simply reading the book, if that is to happen."
12,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5476515-amanda,4,"I'm going to have to stop saying that I don't like non fiction. This is the 3rd ""science ish"" book I have enjoyed recently. This was an interesting look at history as told thru the periodic table. I can't really speak to the accuracy of the science but I really enjoyed reading all the tales. I recognized a lot of the science names but learned some knew things about them. The parts I found the most interesting were how great an effect WWII had on science and scientists and the parts about mental health and brain health. I listened to the audio narrated very ably by Seaan Runnette."
13,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,3,"Drive by review both literally and figuratively. Interesting/educational book with interesting anecdotes. Assumes a level of scientific knowledge not necessarily found in a casually curious science neophyte. IOW, way over my head. Rather hard to maintain focus and interest when you are barely understanding the composition of the simplest atoms. My take aways from the book are that the Periodic Table is drawn the way that it is beyond formatting choices. There are reasons that every element is located where it is on the table. The fact that the Periodic Table is mapped the way it is, is a scientific marvel. Also, Helium is the only element on the Periodic Table that doesn't combine with any other elements to form molecules. It sees itself as perfect. That's it. My sum total take away from the book. Some rather lucky and stupid scientists travails too...3.5ish rounded down because I forgot what element the disappearing spoon was. The stories didn't stick.Listened to the audiobook. Narrated by Sean Runnette who did a respectable job with a complex and sometimes tedious subject."

15,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/127002-ginger-k,2,"So far, not so great. The degree of anthropomorphizing of atoms in the introductory chapters has left me completely puzzled about the actual science involved. I have no idea what it means that oxygen is ""a bully."" Does oxygen shake down other atoms for electrons? How does that even work?However, the chapter on chemical warfare has been (disturbing but) interesting. If the rest of the book is historical-figures character-driven, rather than atomic character-driven, then my overall opinion of the book should improve. Ugh, spoke too soon. Most of the chapter discusses chemical warfare in Europe around the World Wars. Therefore, most of the chapter is about named individuals -- chemists and soldiers and heads of state. And then one gets to the last four pages which are about how the cell phone industry's demand for niobium and tantalum fed the war in the Congo... a war which is all tribalism and ancient grudges (unlike Europe's wars?). ""Gruesome stories have circulated about proud victors humiliating their victims' bodies by draping themselves with entrails and dancing in celebration."" Lurid detail, but with no names, no location, no citations. I wish I were kidding. Gruesome stories circulated about 'the Hun' during the war, too, but I didn't see those stories getting a whole lot of coverage in this science book and for good reason -- so why are the stories about Congolese atrocities getting uncritically repeated here? And then to just win at post-colonialism, he unironically quotes Joseph Conrad, who ""once called Congo, 'the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human consceince,' and there's little reason to revise that notion today."" Thank you ever so much for perpetuating the stereotypical images of the Dark Continent, images which don't need revising despite being a hundred years out of date."
16,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,Okay I will start by saying this is a fascinating book but you will need some understanding of the periodic table and chemistry - now I am not saying you need to be degree level but it will make some of the references a little easier to spot and the importance of some of the statements just that little more dramatic. That said and I have read a number of chemistry books both for fun and for academic reasons (yes okay I am chemist) but I did like how the author approached the subject of each chapter. I will admit that it did sort of follow a formula in that he would explain the focus of the chapter (which element or family of elements) a long with hints of entertaining stories and anecdotes. He would then go back to these stories and explain them further - with the idea that he would reinforce the message of each chapter. So I guess you would have the technical scholarly part followed by the humorous and entertaining story. For me I thought this was a great way of bringing the message home without either being boring or overbearing. This is a great book for those interested in chemistry. Yes by the nature of the book it focuses on the elements and little of their compounds (although it does talk about their chemistries) but its a great launch pad in to further studies 
17,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This book is quite an entertaining read. It is packed with interesting anecdotes about scientists who explored the outer fringes of the periodic table. I even learned a little bit of chemistry. The book is organized in an intelligent manner--each chapter is devoted to some theme, with a small group of elements that fit into that theme in some way. Sometimes the author strays from the exploration of elements, but he always seems to relate to the chapter's theme. The only thing that puts me off a bit, is the author's style. It is a rather folksy style, where the words ""um"", ""well"", and ""friggin"" can be found in the middle of a sentence."
18,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"In a breezy style, Kean intersperses chemistry and physics with a potpourri of stories revolving around the elements. He explains how the elements formed and how they were discovered. He blends complex science and human interest in his examples of how the elements have been used and influenced history. Kean transitions quickly from deep discussions of atomic structure or quantum mechanics to oddities such as the nutcase who turned blue eating silver because he thought there would be no antibiotics after Y2K. Kean tries to make difficult concepts comprehensible such as the fine structure constant and why it is so fundamental to our understanding of the universe. He also fills his book with obscure facts such as how many ounces of the element astatine there are on the earth. The answer is one. And if you find it, it will be gone before you can do anything with it. Kean serves up tidbits of the lives of the scientists including their personal and professional quirks and claims to fame. He focuses on the developers of the periodic table from Mendeleev who is credited with the original to Glenn Seaborg whose discoveries of super heavy elements expanded it. We learn about Linus Pauling’s unraveling of the structure of protein and his misguided attempt to be the first to crack the structure of DNA. Crick and Watson cagily won that race. He discusses the discovery of quantum mechanics from Max Planck’s initial findings about the spectral distribution of black body radiation to Einstein’s concept of energy as a particle and on through Bohr, Heisenberg and others. These are just a few of the brief vignettes of famous scientists in Kean’s book. The Disappearing Spoon is full of good stuff for those who want their science lightened up by entertaining sidebars. It’s a bit of a teaser. Kean gives you just enough to get interested in a topic. So I found myself frequently going on line or considering getting something more in depth. The book’s diversity makes it a great way to find something new you might want to know more about. It’s also the perfect book for readers with short attention spans."
19,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"This book was lots of fun, and it certainly taught me more than I ever learned in high school chemistry class. Quite honestly, if someone had asked me for a definition of ""chemistry"" before, I don't think I would have known what to say. At the same time, The Disappearing Spoon wasn't like a lecture in the least bit, and instead folded tons of scientific information into stories about the scientists and their accomplishments. I'd recommend it to anyone who's curious about a subject they may have only encountered at the 101 level."
20,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3548626-ian-tregillis,4,"This is a rare specimen among the books I tend to read: a two-bookmark book. I was skeptical when this first came to my attention. I grew up reading any and every science-related book I could find. My early fascination with books about science -- particularly chemistry and physics -- led, many years later, to my day job career. (I also blame Dr. Who for this, but that's a longer story.) But it was a long road, and not surprisingly along the way I lost my enthusiasm for reading books about science topics in my spare time. I always have, and always will, love the fact that people are writing and reading them. But somewhere, along the way to becoming an adult, the stuff I used to love as a kid started to feel like... homework. Like taking my work home with me.I thought a book filled with strange anecdotes related to the Periodic Table sounded like a terrific idea for folks that would be interested in such things. But that I would not be one of those people. This, in spite of the fact that when I was much younger (before I finally got to learn about all the stuff I wanted to learn) I used to spend hours staring at the Periodic Table, studying it, trying and failing to unpack its arcane secrets. (And yet somehow I'd completely forgotten about that until I read this book. This book deserves four stars just on the basis of helping me remember this.) Eventually I learned about the mathematics of atoms, and how this gives rise to the Periodic Table. And it was glorious. But then I grew up. Life as an adult is heavy on the mortgage payments, lighter on the soul-stirring wonderment.So, yeah. I figured I didn't need to read a book about the table because I already knew how it worked. It's still true I didn't need to read this book, but the 10-year-old inside me sure did. I'm glad I listened to him.Sam Kean (who, judging from his photo on the rear flap, could be a friend's lost twin) adopts a casual, easygoing tone, which keeps the book easily readable, even when the subject matter might become dry in less capable hands. He touches on the scientific underpinnings of the subject when necessary yet never gets bogged down in the weeds. And though he glosses over the details in places (as is the only right thing to do in a book like this) his explanations make for clear, concise distillations of the subject matter. Never did I find myself tempted to skim, even when I was familiar with the background details. I'd heard a few of the stories in this book, but only a few, and those I'd either misremembered or learned incorrectly in the first place. Much of the information in this book was new to me, but all of it was fascinating. This is much more than a book about the elements and the table upon which they reside; it's also a book about the people who discovered them, loved them, hated them, yearned for them, tried to recreate them. As such, it's filled with remarkable and fascinating tidbits. I didn't know that exposure to tellurium can make a person reek like garlic. I didn't know that beryllium tastes like sugar. (Where I work, the eating of beryllium is discouraged.) I didn't know about the World War I fight over a nearly defunct mine in Colorado. I didn't know that Fritz Haber was such an epic tool. I didn't know that the ""S"" of the BCS theory of superconductivity went to prison.Much of the most fascinating and entertaining material is tucked away in extensive footnotes. The footnote section is worth reading just on its own. The author clearly couldn't resist including many of the little tidbits he'd learned in the course of his research. But rather than breaking the logical development of each section with a tangential anecdote, he leaves the digressions to the footnote section. This section is worth reading just on its own. The notes appear so frequently that I needed two bookmarks, so that I could flip back and forth between the body text and the footnotes section. If you do decide to pick this up, absolutely do not skip the footnotes. Some of the best stuff is in there. Much of it isn't strictly related to the periodic table, but it's golden just the same.The book is organized logically, following the first attempts to classify the elements through to cutting-edge speculations about the ""island of stability"", quantum dots, and other current topics. Each chapter is organized around a theme -- Elements in Times of War, Elements as Money, The Elements of Madness, Poisoner's Corner, etc. The narrative thread of each chapter weaves its way through multiple boxes on the periodic table. (In a lovely piece of book design, the periodic table entries for the relevant elements appear at the top of each chapter.) Kean does an enviable job of developing each chapter logically, and deserves much credit for finding such clean paths through what could have become thickets. In a few places, the narrative's relationship to the chapter theme felt a little forced. But the information along the way is so fun, and presented so well, that I never cared. "
21,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063661-woodge,4,"This book was an interesting compendium of stories linking up the various elements of the Periodic Table. Not only did I learn about the various scientists who discovered this or that element, but I learned a good deal about many of the elements themselves. It was entertaining enough that I kept coming back to it to read more. I've got a much better understanding now of elements and what makes them differ from each other. And I didn't even realize that elements can change (or decay) into other elements. Never really thought about it, I guess. Now I know how it can happen (though not every element does this.) Lots of cool facts and odd stories about odd scientists are embedded in this book. Recommended for anyone interested in science, especially those without a Ph.D. It's rocks for jocks. "

It makes chemistry and physics comprehensible and fun. I listened to it in audio and thought the narrator did a fantastic job with it. He actually made the jokes sound funny. He knew what tone the author was striving for and he hit it spot-on. However, I think I ended up missing a lot by listening rather than reading. The book is so packed full of fun facts and numbers and, of course, references to the periodic table. I'm sure there were charts and diagrams I just didn't get in an audiobook. Plus, my attention would wander and I would completely lose track of what was being discussed.I think I'm going to get a copy of this when it comes out in paperback.

The Periodic Table! Chemistry! How could I possibly be completely enthralled by such a book? How could I dare give it five stars when I wasn't able to truly understand a lot of what I read?Because of the writing, pure and simple.Kean makes chemistry accessible for the willing-to-make-an-intellectual-effort layperson - but it's not just the chemistry. It's the characters BEHIND the chemistry, the stories of their discoveries and the things they overlooked. It's about the politics and the culture and the drama of the creation of that little set of boxes that we're all so familiar with.I was fascinated.I have found myself sharing little anecdotes with my (yes, young) children and my friends. I pulled out the book at dinner tonight and had to tell the story of that ""disappearing spoon"" to everyone at the table. I loved the history, both in our modern world and the earth itself. It feels like this knowledge is so essential to human life, that these things he is talking about are, literally, at the root of what we're all made of and Kean is just able to share that information in an interesting and not-your-stuffy-old-professor style.Yes, there is a lot of science in there, but don't be scared though. You can still get so much out of the stories if you're willing to let yourself gloss over the really deep stuff and just glean as much out of it as you can. I'm going to return my copy to the library and then buy my own, so I can read parts of it again. I liked it that much. "
28,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5310185-qoh,3,"This book takes a monumental topic -- the periodic table -- and breaks it down into various digestible topic areas. While I enjoyed it (and learned a lot of history of science trivia I'd been unaware of, what with my head stuck in the 18th century) and had a few ""a-ha"" moments as some organic chemistry concepts FINALLY made sense to me (14 years after my last ochem class), I have two big problems with the book. -1 star because the book needed editing. Badly. Kean's writing is usually OK, but sometimes forced, folksy, and pedantic. I could go from enjoyment to annoyance to wanting to throw it across the room and/or get out my red pen. -1 star because there is no comprehensive bibliography, which is a cardinal sin in a book about science, just a short list of books. I have no doubt he did a lot of research, but there should be *some* accountability. Instead, in endnotes, there are more folksy stories (that require flipping to the back of the book to read, and which were usually only tangential and not particularly interesting footnotes to the main story, meaning the flow was disrupted for no good reason). In any case: interesting topic, good stories, only OK execution, and little authorial accountability. I really can't see myself reading anything Kean writes in the future unless he cites his sources and drops the folksy facade. "
29,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"The Disappearing Spoon is not quite as entertaining to me as Sam Kean’s book on neuroscience, but it’s still reasonably fun and definitely an easy read. There’s all kinds of random facts, and he makes things like electron shells very clear — even for me, with my brain’s stubborn refusal to grasp it all. He writes with humour and enthusiasm, pulling out interesting characters and discoveries from the history of the Periodic Table and its elements.I’m just not as into chemistry/physics as I am biology. Even organic chemistry. I should be, but, alas. So I found that this dragged a bit — for me. It’d probably be unfair to assume it’d drag for you as well, if you’re actually a fan of chemistry.Originally reviewed on my blog."
30,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,4,"Stop the search. Recall the teams. I have found the non-fiction, summer read of 2010! The Disappearing Spoon.First, what’s a summer read, Mr. Josey Wales thumbnail photo? A summer read is one you can enjoy during a vacation to the beach, with fresh cocktails and clean towels provided by the swarthy, bronzed attendant at a seafront hotel. You can finish it in a few days in bite-sized chunks, it doesn’t overpower you academically, you learn a little, and the subject is something entirely new to you, which allows you to ‘escape’ mentally just as you are physically from that 50-hour, weekly cubicle career and hateful commuter traffic.The book catalogues the 200 year history of the piecemeal development of the periodic table in chemistry. Wait, this is not your high school chemistry class! Sam Kean uses the most idiosyncratic, unusual, serendipitous, and funny events to tell this story. You learn as much about the brilliant, boisterous, bi-polar, bastardly, and braggadocio scientists as you learn about each element on the periodic table. Each of 19 chapters pulls together several periodic elements and outlines their unexpected similarity and relatedness--atomically, quantumly and culturally. And the narrative moves fluidly back and forth through time to capture the relevant history of each element. The book highlights discoveries that are still being made, current as of late 2009.Strontium, Molybdenum, Ruthenium, Francium, Ytterbium. Neptunium, Berkelium, Californium, Lawrencium. What are you all about? How were you discovered? Why are you so important? And why the heck are you so rare? This is neat science told in a fun and effervescent way. There are some awesome, awe-inspiring, and yet sometimes pedestrian, elements out there. Science ofttimes moves forward in jumps and spurts, and Kean is quick to relate how it moves chaotically, unexpectedly, bizarrely, and accidentally. The author reviews not just core chemistry but also history, physics, cosmology, and psychology. The scientists and their Rube Goldberg experiments are as interesting as the results. Periodic elements are really cool (yes, I actually said that). They’re phenomenal, toxic, powerful, rare, ephemeral, magical, radioactive, and have the most interesting relationships to each other. We’re told why, when, and how they’ve been used and abused through history, and how they shepherded great leaps in the advancement of human civilization.The Disappearing Spoon is quick, light reading out in the sun. It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way. Kean uses good rhythm in the book, chapters of uniform length, and a bit of humor to bring it all home. He pulls it off effectively--Mr Wizard meets chaos theory. Sixth grade, mall, ‘wow’-science is discussed right next to the paragraph about how to produce absolute zero or 35 million degrees, both of which, incidentally, are created by lasers.In the end, you’ll learn a little, laugh a little. You may not remember anything from this book 2 years from now, but you will retain this: elements are neat as hell, and thank goodness for chemists and physicists. New words: depilatory, eluted"
31,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,0,"My GR friend Jason writes sturdy and trustworthy reviews, but I must take exception with him here :The Disappearing Spoon is quick, light reading out in the sun. It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way.Yes, it is all that, IF such stuff as this makes sense to you :The strongest solo acid is still the boron-based carborane (HCB11C111) And this boron acid has the best punchline so far : it's simultaneously the world's strongest and gentlest acid. To wrap your head around that, remember that acids split into positive and negative parts. In carborane's case you get H+ and an elaborate cagelike structure formed by everything else (CB11C111-) With most acids it's the negative portion that's corrosive and caustic and eats through the skin. But the boron cage forms one of the most stable molecules ever invented. Its boron atoms share electrons so generously that it practically becomes helium, and it won't go around ripping electrons from other atoms, the usual cause of acidic carnage.Well, this could be part of the rules of Quidditch for all the sense it makes to poor general reader me, so I think The Disappearing Spoon is really for science geeks who think stuff about German chemists being hornswoggled out of a Nobel Prize for Alchemy by some Californian sharpies in 1951 or a neat account of the crucial properties of the biomolecule which are called handedness is the very thing for those moments on the beach when there isn't any eye candy around."
32,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3504278-kate,4,"Okay. Let me tell it to you honestly.This book is not the most well written book - the sentences are clunky and there is not a clear narrative. It is much more of a rambling collection of stories and facts and quirky science knowledge.That said, I couldn't get back to reading this fast enough. I thought about a book about the scientific table throughout the day. I stole a few minutes wherever I could. I carried this book with me and was even *gasp* early to pick up the kids so that I could read a few minutes in the car.I mean, the opening factoid is about our ability to trace Lewis & Clark's trail by following the mercury laced poop trail. I love that shit. Growing up, I never loved science. I didn't learn the periodic table in school like others did. And so, there were times in this book, where I only understood a few clauses in each paragraph because the concepts were so advanced, but the author did a great job of bringing it back to a laypersons' comprehension in the next paragraph. So, in summary, this book is written for all levels of science (or not) nerds. It is full of incredible tales and the fun secrets and stories of the people involved in the development of the periodic table (and science as we know it).I will absolutely be rereading this book - most definitely when the boys are learning the periodic table in school."
33,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,4,"This is an absolutely brilliant idea for a book and it’s a superb book. It’s beautifully organized and well written. It’s a wonderful way to learn and/or deepen knowledge of chemistry. This book is fine for laypeople, but will give meaning and extra enjoyment even for advanced chemistry students. Much appreciated by me was that the information imparted was over my head only a very few times, and that’s saying a lot, because I’ve never taken a chemistry class.This book covers the elements of the periodic table via its history and by telling stories about the various elements: their history of discovery, how they’ve been used at various times, various people who found ways to make use of them. Anyone with a smidgen of curiosity about any aspect of life should find many things here that they find interesting. So many subjects are covered including astronomy, war, South Pole exploration, health and illness and poisoning, history, other sciences, the personalities of those who have contributed to the findings in the field, and so much more. It’s jam packed with useful facts and enjoyable stories. The relevance of the elements (chemistry) in everyday life is made so clear.There are many lovely digressions that turn out not to be digressions at all. There were very amusing parts, including funny quips that frequently pop up, and all of those quips have substance. It has a sort of gossipy (in a good way) tone. I learned so much. I found out that I love Linus Pauling and many other scientists who’ve contributed to the field. I was surprised how much of what’s been discovered in the field of chemistry has been done fairly recently, and how it’s still a growing, living scientific endeavor. While I’ve always been interested in science, and I did want a chemistry set when I was a child (request denied), I knew deplorably little about chemistry. Like the author, I loved playing with growing balls of mercury from broken thermometers. Quite a few of the elements themselves were, of course, familiar to me, but I didn’t know much about them. I had a bit of chemistry in other college science classes and in nutrition class. As I read, I frequently wished I’d memorized the table before reading this book. There is a table of the elements in the back of the book but it includes abbreviations only; it is not embellished; there is no list of elements by name next to it. However, in the index, thankfully, the elements are listed in bold, and I referred to that index at the beginning of every chapter when some elements were listed, in what looked to me like unusual Scrabble tiles. I read the notes as I read along, and they were easy to find because they started with page number and beginning of phrase in bold as a match their section in the book, but I’d still rather they’d have been included in the text proper to make the information even easier to read and to make it flow more smoothly.This book should be part of every beginning chemistry class. It makes the subject so interesting. This is certainly not the only attempt to make chemistry a great deal of fun for everyone. The book mentions the Tom Lehrer song, The Elements (which can be seen in many places including here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYW50F...).I really enjoyed this book, although I did end up reading it slowly, and I did take one break to read the young adult novel Mockingjay, which I’d been waiting to read for nearly a year.This is a gem of a book and such a great idea. I adored the humor, and there was a lot of it. I’ll let readers see for themselves why the book’s title is what it is.I hope that Sam Kean (or someone) writes similar books about physics, mathematics, etc. etc. I would definitely read them if they were as clever as this book."

To that goodreads troll I now have an answer: this book.If you had told me a few weeks ago that I'd find a book about chemistry and the periodic table of elements difficult to put down, I'd have had a hard time believing you. But I did. This book was funny, interesting, even gripping at times, and always engaging. I took off a star because I'll admit that I didn't get all of it despite the author's best efforts. I guess it would take more than a fun book to turn me into a chemistry person. But it was still a wonderful read, and not a guilty pleasure because it was actually educational. This meant I could feel virtuous for once while I ignored my various responsibilities in favor of more reading.So not only did I get to enjoy a good book, I feel vindicated in my ongoing belief that a a sufficiently good writer can make any topic interesting, even to a reluctant reader. Yes – sometimes it pays to leave your reading comfort zone. And when it doesn’t, you have every right to complain because it is about the book, not just about a personal bias with regard to the content. For a good book, there should be no such thing as a “right” or “wrong” reader."
36,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431873-emily,3,"This book took me 76 days, or almost three months, to read. In this case, I needed all seventy-six individual days to work my brain through passages like this one:
For instance, thirteen aluminium atoms grouped together in the right way do a killer bromine: the two entities are indistinguishable in chemical reactions. This happens despite the cluster being thirteen times larger than a single bromine atom and despite aluminium being nothing like the lacrimatory poison-gas staple ... The clusters work like this. The atoms arrange themselves into a three-dimensional polyhedron, and each atom in it mimics a proton and a neutron in a collective nucleus. The caveat is that electrons can flow around inside this soft nucleic blob, and the atoms share the electrons collectively. Scientists wryly call this state of matter ""jellium.""
All you need to know is that I'm sort of an idiot. If you read the above passage and thought, ""This makes perfect sense! What an appropriate way to explain jellium, a state I've always been interested in!"", then you are less of an idiot than me and will probably enjoy this book very much. To give more context, here's how much of an idiot I am: when I took physics at Stanford (on the way to my successful minor! ha!), I had a lot of trouble with electricity and optics. To study, I did literally every single problem from those chapters, and I did the word problems multiple times. When I got to the final, I immediately recognized one of the problems I had done at least four times, was jubilant for about 2 seconds, and then realized I had absolutely no idea how to do it. (I think I only got half credit.) That is how good I am at squashing scientific concepts into my brain. On the positive side, I find all of this very interesting, and because I forget it so quickly, I have a lifetime of renewed discoveries ahead of me."

I was fascinated by the many details about the hunt for elements, the private lives of the Curies, the radioactive boy scout, the dangers of storing rare elements in the Congo, and that the same man who invented nitrogen rich fertilizers, is also the inventor of zyklon B. It also made me want to read more about The Manhattan Project, so I guess its time to put the Rhodes book on my wishlist."

This book is rich in empirical evidence and interesting tales of the last 200 years of history and discoveries of the chemical elements of the periodic table. However, the countless stories lacked the threads that could have given them a common fabric.The periodic table, which is currently comprised of 118 elements (112 at the time the book was written), is an ongoing process. The number of elements in our 14 billion year old universe increased over time. Right after the Big Bang a couple of elements formed, but later through nuclear fusion in stars, and stellar explosions known as supernovas, created and released the other naturally occurring elements. The remaining elements in the periodic table are synthetic (woman-made / man-made). The book walks us through Mendeleev's periodic table of elements that is composed of the main ingredients that chemists, physicists, and other scientist use for their recipes and experiments. The author shares many amusing background stories on how numerous chemical elements were isolated and shaped the way wars were fought, politics conducted, and relationships impacted.We see how women, like Marie Skłodowska Curie, her daughter Irene, Lise Meitner, and others played a pivotal role in the evolution of the periodic table.The author also recognizes that science, as a whole, was greatly contributed by immigrants.Somewhere in the first quarter of the book an interesting question was asked by Kean and that is whether theory or experiments are responsible for the advancement of science? I wish this question was further elaborated. The reader will definitely walk away with a considerable amount of interesting information, but not enough understanding of the subject matter. The author spent almost the whole book informing, rather than teaching and challenging me to think. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting a tour of the chemical elements and their backstories.[I read the Montenegrin (Serbian / Croatian / Bosnian) translation Kašika koja nestaje - autor Sem Kin.

It's not poorly written (though it ain't Solzhenitsyn) and it's not that uninteresting of a topic, but I just found that after the first 40ish pages, I dreaded having to read more. It was like pulling teeth, only a bit less painful, even without the option of novocaine.I think part of it was that the book wasn't well organized. The author seemed to jump around the periodic table at his whim without keeping a consistent framework (perhaps that was the point, it was a bit unclear to me). Anyway, the writing is OKish enough and it is certainly very well researched, so I can understand why many people have liked it. And it's really not a bad science book, but for some reason I just found myself having a viscerally negative reaction to having to read the next chapter (well I guess I didn't have to keep reading on, but whatever). I don't know, I wish I could pinpoint the source of my discontent with this, but it is what it is, so feel free to try it out for yourself."

I feel like I learned some things, which isn't that difficult of a feat since what I remember from my high school chemistry class has more to do with the people sitting near me (we called ourselves the Peanut Gallery). I have vague memories of a teacher, the great Thorstein Sabo, who tried to teach us about the periodic table by telling us stories about electrons playing cribbage in the electron hotel. I didn't really get it. This book groups different elements, and tells stories about them in context of political intrigue, devastating consequences, and lifesaving discoveries. Coincidentally, I am also reading Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age, a book with a lot of parallels to The Disappearing Spoon. Where The Disappearing Spoon demonstrates how war interrupts scientific process, Rites of Spring shows the same about war interfering in the arts. You have to wonder how much farther, or at least different, both science and the arts would be, had we never had the world wars consuming the first half of the twentieth century.The tiny pieces of information I didn't know would fill a book, this book. It would be impossible to even recite them, but I particularly enjoyed the story of argyria, silver poisoning, and the senate/governor hopeful who drank collodial silver in preparation for Y2K. Argyria turns your skin blue... permanently. Papa smurf!I also made a note to myself to check out the poet Lowell, who is one of the first people to be treated with Lithium for mental illness. Salt (not an element) was also put into perspective with Ghandi and enforced iodine and I just don't know whether to be grateful that my government is preventing birth defects or to be freaked out that they are adding things like iodine to salt and fluoride to the water. The audiobook was great for this. Sean Runnette has a unique voice that I enjoyed in zombie stories but still translated well to science!I will leave you with a song I could not get out of my head during my listen to the second half of the book."

Not because I wasn't enjoying the book: it's readable, fascinating, and chock full of the very anecdotes about science and scientists that I love. So then, why the hell did I find this book so hard?It's precisely because the book is a collection of anecdotes that it was so hard to read. I felt like I was trying to grasp quicksilver (mercury, symbol Hg from Latin hydragyrum, meaning “water silver”) as this steady diet of atomic information arrived. Actually, that's a lousy metaphor: quicksilver is a glistening hypnotic liquid because its atoms stick together. These atomic anecdotes didn't: nothing stuck in my head, nothing stuck to each other. There was no overall organizing principle to the book that I could divine, and reluctantly I finished it barely the wiser than I begun.This book demands flashcards. I want to know the anecdotes. I want them to stick. I am going to have to work at it, however, beyond simply reading the book, if that is to happen."

I recognized a lot of the science names but learned some knew things about them. The parts I found the most interesting were how great an effect WWII had on science and scientists and the parts about mental health and brain health. I listened to the audio narrated very ably by Seaan Runnette."

Assumes a level of scientific knowledge not necessarily found in a casually curious science neophyte. IOW, way over my head. Rather hard to maintain focus and interest when you are barely understanding the composition of the simplest atoms. My take aways from the book are that the Periodic Table is drawn the way that it is beyond formatting choices. There are reasons that every element is located where it is on the table. The fact that the Periodic Table is mapped the way it is, is a scientific marvel. Also, Helium is the only element on the Periodic Table that doesn't combine with any other elements to form molecules. It sees itself as perfect. That's it. My sum total take away from the book. Some rather lucky and stupid scientists travails too...3.5ish rounded down because I forgot what element the disappearing spoon was. The stories didn't stick.Listened to the audiobook. Narrated by Sean Runnette who did a respectable job with a complex and sometimes tedious subject."

45,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/127002-ginger-k,2,"So far, not so great. The degree of anthropomorphizing of atoms in the introductory chapters has left me completely puzzled about the actual science involved. I have no idea what it means that oxygen is ""a bully."" Does oxygen shake down other atoms for electrons? How does that even work?However, the chapter on chemical warfare has been (disturbing but) interesting. If the rest of the book is historical-figures character-driven, rather than atomic character-driven, then my overall opinion of the book should improve. Ugh, spoke too soon. Most of the chapter discusses chemical warfare in Europe around the World Wars. Therefore, most of the chapter is about named individuals -- chemists and soldiers and heads of state. And then one gets to the last four pages which are about how the cell phone industry's demand for niobium and tantalum fed the war in the Congo... a war which is all tribalism and ancient grudges (unlike Europe's wars?). ""Gruesome stories have circulated about proud victors humiliating their victims' bodies by draping themselves with entrails and dancing in celebration."" Lurid detail, but with no names, no location, no citations. I wish I were kidding. Gruesome stories circulated about 'the Hun' during the war, too, but I didn't see those stories getting a whole lot of coverage in this science book and for good reason -- so why are the stories about Congolese atrocities getting uncritically repeated here? And then to just win at post-colonialism, he unironically quotes Joseph Conrad, who ""once called Congo, 'the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human consceince,' and there's little reason to revise that notion today."" Thank you ever so much for perpetuating the stereotypical images of the Dark Continent, images which don't need revising despite being a hundred years out of date."
46,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,Okay I will start by saying this is a fascinating book but you will need some understanding of the periodic table and chemistry - now I am not saying you need to be degree level but it will make some of the references a little easier to spot and the importance of some of the statements just that little more dramatic. That said and I have read a number of chemistry books both for fun and for academic reasons (yes okay I am chemist) but I did like how the author approached the subject of each chapter. I will admit that it did sort of follow a formula in that he would explain the focus of the chapter (which element or family of elements) a long with hints of entertaining stories and anecdotes. He would then go back to these stories and explain them further - with the idea that he would reinforce the message of each chapter. So I guess you would have the technical scholarly part followed by the humorous and entertaining story. For me I thought this was a great way of bringing the message home without either being boring or overbearing. This is a great book for those interested in chemistry. Yes by the nature of the book it focuses on the elements and little of their compounds (although it does talk about their chemistries) but its a great launch pad in to further studies 
47,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This book is quite an entertaining read. It is packed with interesting anecdotes about scientists who explored the outer fringes of the periodic table. I even learned a little bit of chemistry. The book is organized in an intelligent manner--each chapter is devoted to some theme, with a small group of elements that fit into that theme in some way. Sometimes the author strays from the exploration of elements, but he always seems to relate to the chapter's theme. The only thing that puts me off a bit, is the author's style. It is a rather folksy style, where the words ""um"", ""well"", and ""friggin"" can be found in the middle of a sentence."
48,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"In a breezy style, Kean intersperses chemistry and physics with a potpourri of stories revolving around the elements. He explains how the elements formed and how they were discovered. He blends complex science and human interest in his examples of how the elements have been used and influenced history. Kean transitions quickly from deep discussions of atomic structure or quantum mechanics to oddities such as the nutcase who turned blue eating silver because he thought there would be no antibiotics after Y2K. Kean tries to make difficult concepts comprehensible such as the fine structure constant and why it is so fundamental to our understanding of the universe. He also fills his book with obscure facts such as how many ounces of the element astatine there are on the earth. The answer is one. And if you find it, it will be gone before you can do anything with it. Kean serves up tidbits of the lives of the scientists including their personal and professional quirks and claims to fame. He focuses on the developers of the periodic table from Mendeleev who is credited with the original to Glenn Seaborg whose discoveries of super heavy elements expanded it. We learn about Linus Pauling’s unraveling of the structure of protein and his misguided attempt to be the first to crack the structure of DNA. Crick and Watson cagily won that race. He discusses the discovery of quantum mechanics from Max Planck’s initial findings about the spectral distribution of black body radiation to Einstein’s concept of energy as a particle and on through Bohr, Heisenberg and others. These are just a few of the brief vignettes of famous scientists in Kean’s book. The Disappearing Spoon is full of good stuff for those who want their science lightened up by entertaining sidebars. It’s a bit of a teaser. Kean gives you just enough to get interested in a topic. So I found myself frequently going on line or considering getting something more in depth. The book’s diversity makes it a great way to find something new you might want to know more about. It’s also the perfect book for readers with short attention spans."
49,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"This book was lots of fun, and it certainly taught me more than I ever learned in high school chemistry class. Quite honestly, if someone had asked me for a definition of ""chemistry"" before, I don't think I would have known what to say. At the same time, The Disappearing Spoon wasn't like a lecture in the least bit, and instead folded tons of scientific information into stories about the scientists and their accomplishments. I'd recommend it to anyone who's curious about a subject they may have only encountered at the 101 level."
50,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3548626-ian-tregillis,4,"This is a rare specimen among the books I tend to read: a two-bookmark book. I was skeptical when this first came to my attention. I grew up reading any and every science-related book I could find. My early fascination with books about science -- particularly chemistry and physics -- led, many years later, to my day job career. (I also blame Dr. Who for this, but that's a longer story.) But it was a long road, and not surprisingly along the way I lost my enthusiasm for reading books about science topics in my spare time. I always have, and always will, love the fact that people are writing and reading them. But somewhere, along the way to becoming an adult, the stuff I used to love as a kid started to feel like... homework. Like taking my work home with me.I thought a book filled with strange anecdotes related to the Periodic Table sounded like a terrific idea for folks that would be interested in such things. But that I would not be one of those people. This, in spite of the fact that when I was much younger (before I finally got to learn about all the stuff I wanted to learn) I used to spend hours staring at the Periodic Table, studying it, trying and failing to unpack its arcane secrets. (And yet somehow I'd completely forgotten about that until I read this book. This book deserves four stars just on the basis of helping me remember this.) Eventually I learned about the mathematics of atoms, and how this gives rise to the Periodic Table. And it was glorious. But then I grew up. Life as an adult is heavy on the mortgage payments, lighter on the soul-stirring wonderment.So, yeah. I figured I didn't need to read a book about the table because I already knew how it worked. It's still true I didn't need to read this book, but the 10-year-old inside me sure did. I'm glad I listened to him.Sam Kean (who, judging from his photo on the rear flap, could be a friend's lost twin) adopts a casual, easygoing tone, which keeps the book easily readable, even when the subject matter might become dry in less capable hands. He touches on the scientific underpinnings of the subject when necessary yet never gets bogged down in the weeds. And though he glosses over the details in places (as is the only right thing to do in a book like this) his explanations make for clear, concise distillations of the subject matter. Never did I find myself tempted to skim, even when I was familiar with the background details. I'd heard a few of the stories in this book, but only a few, and those I'd either misremembered or learned incorrectly in the first place. Much of the information in this book was new to me, but all of it was fascinating. This is much more than a book about the elements and the table upon which they reside; it's also a book about the people who discovered them, loved them, hated them, yearned for them, tried to recreate them. As such, it's filled with remarkable and fascinating tidbits. I didn't know that exposure to tellurium can make a person reek like garlic. I didn't know that beryllium tastes like sugar. (Where I work, the eating of beryllium is discouraged.) I didn't know about the World War I fight over a nearly defunct mine in Colorado. I didn't know that Fritz Haber was such an epic tool. I didn't know that the ""S"" of the BCS theory of superconductivity went to prison.Much of the most fascinating and entertaining material is tucked away in extensive footnotes. The footnote section is worth reading just on its own. The author clearly couldn't resist including many of the little tidbits he'd learned in the course of his research. But rather than breaking the logical development of each section with a tangential anecdote, he leaves the digressions to the footnote section. This section is worth reading just on its own. The notes appear so frequently that I needed two bookmarks, so that I could flip back and forth between the body text and the footnotes section. If you do decide to pick this up, absolutely do not skip the footnotes. Some of the best stuff is in there. Much of it isn't strictly related to the periodic table, but it's golden just the same.The book is organized logically, following the first attempts to classify the elements through to cutting-edge speculations about the ""island of stability"", quantum dots, and other current topics. Each chapter is organized around a theme -- Elements in Times of War, Elements as Money, The Elements of Madness, Poisoner's Corner, etc. The narrative thread of each chapter weaves its way through multiple boxes on the periodic table. (In a lovely piece of book design, the periodic table entries for the relevant elements appear at the top of each chapter.) Kean does an enviable job of developing each chapter logically, and deserves much credit for finding such clean paths through what could have become thickets. In a few places, the narrative's relationship to the chapter theme felt a little forced. But the information along the way is so fun, and presented so well, that I never cared. "
51,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063661-woodge,4,"This book was an interesting compendium of stories linking up the various elements of the Periodic Table. Not only did I learn about the various scientists who discovered this or that element, but I learned a good deal about many of the elements themselves. It was entertaining enough that I kept coming back to it to read more. I've got a much better understanding now of elements and what makes them differ from each other. And I didn't even realize that elements can change (or decay) into other elements. Never really thought about it, I guess. Now I know how it can happen (though not every element does this.) Lots of cool facts and odd stories about odd scientists are embedded in this book. Recommended for anyone interested in science, especially those without a Ph.D. It's rocks for jocks. "

It makes chemistry and physics comprehensible and fun. I listened to it in audio and thought the narrator did a fantastic job with it. He actually made the jokes sound funny. He knew what tone the author was striving for and he hit it spot-on. However, I think I ended up missing a lot by listening rather than reading. The book is so packed full of fun facts and numbers and, of course, references to the periodic table. I'm sure there were charts and diagrams I just didn't get in an audiobook.

The Periodic Table! Chemistry! How could I possibly be completely enthralled by such a book? How could I dare give it five stars when I wasn't able to truly understand a lot of what I read?Because of the writing, pure and simple.Kean makes chemistry accessible for the willing-to-make-an-intellectual-effort layperson - but it's not just the chemistry. It's the characters BEHIND the chemistry, the stories of their discoveries and the things they overlooked. It's about the politics and the culture and the drama of the creation of that little set of boxes that we're all so familiar with.I was fascinated.I have found myself sharing little anecdotes with my (yes, young) children and my friends. I pulled out the book at dinner tonight and had to tell the story of that ""disappearing spoon"" to everyone at the table. I loved the history, both in our modern world and the earth itself. It feels like this knowledge is so essential to human life, that these things he is talking about are, literally, at the root of what we're all made of and Kean is just able to share that information in an interesting and not-your-stuffy-old-professor style.Yes, there is a lot of science in there, but don't be scared though. You can still get so much out of the stories if you're willing to let yourself gloss over the really deep stuff and just glean as much out of it as you can. I'm going to return my copy to the library and then buy my own, so I can read parts of it again. I liked it that much. "
58,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5310185-qoh,3,"This book takes a monumental topic -- the periodic table -- and breaks it down into various digestible topic areas. While I enjoyed it (and learned a lot of history of science trivia I'd been unaware of, what with my head stuck in the 18th century) and had a few ""a-ha"" moments as some organic chemistry concepts FINALLY made sense to me (14 years after my last ochem class), I have two big problems with the book. -1 star because the book needed editing. Badly. Kean's writing is usually OK, but sometimes forced, folksy, and pedantic. I could go from enjoyment to annoyance to wanting to throw it across the room and/or get out my red pen. -1 star because there is no comprehensive bibliography, which is a cardinal sin in a book about science, just a short list of books. I have no doubt he did a lot of research, but there should be *some* accountability. Instead, in endnotes, there are more folksy stories (that require flipping to the back of the book to read, and which were usually only tangential and not particularly interesting footnotes to the main story, meaning the flow was disrupted for no good reason). In any case: interesting topic, good stories, only OK execution, and little authorial accountability. I really can't see myself reading anything Kean writes in the future unless he cites his sources and drops the folksy facade. "
59,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"The Disappearing Spoon is not quite as entertaining to me as Sam Kean’s book on neuroscience, but it’s still reasonably fun and definitely an easy read. There’s all kinds of random facts, and he makes things like electron shells very clear — even for me, with my brain’s stubborn refusal to grasp it all. He writes with humour and enthusiasm, pulling out interesting characters and discoveries from the history of the Periodic Table and its elements.I’m just not as into chemistry/physics as I am biology. Even organic chemistry. I should be, but, alas. So I found that this dragged a bit — for me.

60,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,4,"Stop the search. Recall the teams. I have found the non-fiction, summer read of 2010! The Disappearing Spoon.First, what’s a summer read, Mr. Josey Wales thumbnail photo? A summer read is one you can enjoy during a vacation to the beach, with fresh cocktails and clean towels provided by the swarthy, bronzed attendant at a seafront hotel. You can finish it in a few days in bite-sized chunks, it doesn’t overpower you academically, you learn a little, and the subject is something entirely new to you, which allows you to ‘escape’ mentally just as you are physically from that 50-hour, weekly cubicle career and hateful commuter traffic.The book catalogues the 200 year history of the piecemeal development of the periodic table in chemistry. Wait, this is not your high school chemistry class! Sam Kean uses the most idiosyncratic, unusual, serendipitous, and funny events to tell this story. You learn as much about the brilliant, boisterous, bi-polar, bastardly, and braggadocio scientists as you learn about each element on the periodic table. Each of 19 chapters pulls together several periodic elements and outlines their unexpected similarity and relatedness--atomically, quantumly and culturally. And the narrative moves fluidly back and forth through time to capture the relevant history of each element. The book highlights discoveries that are still being made, current as of late 2009.Strontium, Molybdenum, Ruthenium, Francium, Ytterbium. Neptunium, Berkelium, Californium, Lawrencium. What are you all about? How were you discovered? Why are you so important? And why the heck are you so rare? This is neat science told in a fun and effervescent way. There are some awesome, awe-inspiring, and yet sometimes pedestrian, elements out there. Science ofttimes moves forward in jumps and spurts, and Kean is quick to relate how it moves chaotically, unexpectedly, bizarrely, and accidentally. The author reviews not just core chemistry but also history, physics, cosmology, and psychology. The scientists and their Rube Goldberg experiments are as interesting as the results. Periodic elements are really cool (yes, I actually said that). They’re phenomenal, toxic, powerful, rare, ephemeral, magical, radioactive, and have the most interesting relationships to each other. We’re told why, when, and how they’ve been used and abused through history, and how they shepherded great leaps in the advancement of human civilization.The Disappearing Spoon is quick, light reading out in the sun. It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way. Kean uses good rhythm in the book, chapters of uniform length, and a bit of humor to bring it all home. He pulls it off effectively--Mr Wizard meets chaos theory. Sixth grade, mall, ‘wow’-science is discussed right next to the paragraph about how to produce absolute zero or 35 million degrees, both of which, incidentally, are created by lasers.In the end, you’ll learn a little, laugh a little. You may not remember anything from this book 2 years from now, but you will retain this: elements are neat as hell, and thank goodness for chemists and physicists. New words: depilatory, eluted"

It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way.Yes, it is all that, IF such stuff as this makes sense to you :The strongest solo acid is still the boron-based carborane (HCB11C111) And this boron acid has the best punchline so far : it's simultaneously the world's strongest and gentlest acid. To wrap your head around that, remember that acids split into positive and negative parts. In carborane's case you get H+ and an elaborate cagelike structure formed by everything else (CB11C111-) With most acids it's the negative portion that's corrosive and caustic and eats through the skin. But the boron cage forms one of the most stable molecules ever invented. Its boron atoms share electrons so generously that it practically becomes helium, and it won't go around ripping electrons from other atoms, the usual cause of acidic carnage.Well, this could be part of the rules of Quidditch for all the sense it makes to poor general reader me, so I think The Disappearing Spoon is really for science geeks who think stuff about German chemists being hornswoggled out of a Nobel Prize for Alchemy by some Californian sharpies in 1951 or a neat account of the crucial properties of the biomolecule which are called handedness is the very thing for those moments on the beach when there isn't any eye candy around."
62,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3504278-kate,4,"Okay. Let me tell it to you honestly.This book is not the most well written book - the sentences are clunky and there is not a clear narrative. It is much more of a rambling collection of stories and facts and quirky science knowledge.That said, I couldn't get back to reading this fast enough. I thought about a book about the scientific table throughout the day. I stole a few minutes wherever I could. I carried this book with me and was even *gasp* early to pick up the kids so that I could read a few minutes in the car.I mean, the opening factoid is about our ability to trace Lewis & Clark's trail by following the mercury laced poop trail. I love that shit. Growing up, I never loved science. I didn't learn the periodic table in school like others did. And so, there were times in this book, where I only understood a few clauses in each paragraph because the concepts were so advanced, but the author did a great job of bringing it back to a laypersons' comprehension in the next paragraph. So, in summary, this book is written for all levels of science (or not) nerds. It is full of incredible tales and the fun secrets and stories of the people involved in the development of the periodic table (and science as we know it).I will absolutely be rereading this book - most definitely when the boys are learning the periodic table in school."
63,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,4,"This is an absolutely brilliant idea for a book and it’s a superb book. It’s beautifully organized and well written. It’s a wonderful way to learn and/or deepen knowledge of chemistry. This book is fine for laypeople, but will give meaning and extra enjoyment even for advanced chemistry students. Much appreciated by me was that the information imparted was over my head only a very few times, and that’s saying a lot, because I’ve never taken a chemistry class.This book covers the elements of the periodic table via its history and by telling stories about the various elements: their history of discovery, how they’ve been used at various times, various people who found ways to make use of them. Anyone with a smidgen of curiosity about any aspect of life should find many things here that they find interesting. So many subjects are covered including astronomy, war, South Pole exploration, health and illness and poisoning, history, other sciences, the personalities of those who have contributed to the findings in the field, and so much more. It’s jam packed with useful facts and enjoyable stories. The relevance of the elements (chemistry) in everyday life is made so clear.There are many lovely digressions that turn out not to be digressions at all. There were very amusing parts, including funny quips that frequently pop up, and all of those quips have substance. It has a sort of gossipy (in a good way) tone. I learned so much. I found out that I love Linus Pauling and many other scientists who’ve contributed to the field. I was surprised how much of what’s been discovered in the field of chemistry has been done fairly recently, and how it’s still a growing, living scientific endeavor. While I’ve always been interested in science, and I did want a chemistry set when I was a child (request denied), I knew deplorably little about chemistry. Like the author, I loved playing with growing balls of mercury from broken thermometers. Quite a few of the elements themselves were, of course, familiar to me, but I didn’t know much about them. I had a bit of chemistry in other college science classes and in nutrition class. As I read, I frequently wished I’d memorized the table before reading this book. There is a table of the elements in the back of the book but it includes abbreviations only; it is not embellished; there is no list of elements by name next to it. However, in the index, thankfully, the elements are listed in bold, and I referred to that index at the beginning of every chapter when some elements were listed, in what looked to me like unusual Scrabble tiles. I read the notes as I read along, and they were easy to find because they started with page number and beginning of phrase in bold as a match their section in the book, but I’d still rather they’d have been included in the text proper to make the information even easier to read and to make it flow more smoothly.This book should be part of every beginning chemistry class. It makes the subject so interesting. This is certainly not the only attempt to make chemistry a great deal of fun for everyone. The book mentions the Tom Lehrer song, The Elements (which can be seen in many places including here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYW50F...).I really enjoyed this book, although I did end up reading it slowly, and I did take one break to read the young adult novel Mockingjay, which I’d been waiting to read for nearly a year.This is a gem of a book and such a great idea. I adored the humor, and there was a lot of it. I’ll let readers see for themselves why the book’s title is what it is.I hope that Sam Kean (or someone) writes similar books about physics, mathematics, etc. etc. I would definitely read them if they were as clever as this book."

To that goodreads troll I now have an answer: this book.If you had told me a few weeks ago that I'd find a book about chemistry and the periodic table of elements difficult to put down, I'd have had a hard time believing you. But I did. This book was funny, interesting, even gripping at times, and always engaging. I took off a star because I'll admit that I didn't get all of it despite the author's best efforts. I guess it would take more than a fun book to turn me into a chemistry person. But it was still a wonderful read, and not a guilty pleasure because it was actually educational. This meant I could feel virtuous for once while I ignored my various responsibilities in favor of more reading.So not only did I get to enjoy a good book, I feel vindicated in my ongoing belief that a a sufficiently good writer can make any topic interesting, even to a reluctant reader. Yes – sometimes it pays to leave your reading comfort zone. And when it doesn’t, you have every right to complain because it is about the book, not just about a personal bias with regard to the content. For a good book, there should be no such thing as a “right” or “wrong” reader."
66,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431873-emily,3,"This book took me 76 days, or almost three months, to read. In this case, I needed all seventy-six individual days to work my brain through passages like this one:
For instance, thirteen aluminium atoms grouped together in the right way do a killer bromine: the two entities are indistinguishable in chemical reactions. This happens despite the cluster being thirteen times larger than a single bromine atom and despite aluminium being nothing like the lacrimatory poison-gas staple ... The clusters work like this. The atoms arrange themselves into a three-dimensional polyhedron, and each atom in it mimics a proton and a neutron in a collective nucleus. The caveat is that electrons can flow around inside this soft nucleic blob, and the atoms share the electrons collectively. Scientists wryly call this state of matter ""jellium.""
All you need to know is that I'm sort of an idiot. If you read the above passage and thought, ""This makes perfect sense! What an appropriate way to explain jellium, a state I've always been interested in!"", then you are less of an idiot than me and will probably enjoy this book very much. To give more context, here's how much of an idiot I am: when I took physics at Stanford (on the way to my successful minor! ha!), I had a lot of trouble with electricity and optics. To study, I did literally every single problem from those chapters, and I did the word problems multiple times. When I got to the final, I immediately recognized one of the problems I had done at least four times, was jubilant for about 2 seconds, and then realized I had absolutely no idea how to do it. (I think I only got half credit.) That is how good I am at squashing scientific concepts into my brain. On the positive side, I find all of this very interesting, and because I forget it so quickly, I have a lifetime of renewed discoveries ahead of me."

I was fascinated by the many details about the hunt for elements, the private lives of the Curies, the radioactive boy scout, the dangers of storing rare elements in the Congo, and that the same man who invented nitrogen rich fertilizers, is also the inventor of zyklon B. It also made me want to read more about The Manhattan Project, so I guess its time to put the Rhodes book on my wishlist."

This book is rich in empirical evidence and interesting tales of the last 200 years of history and discoveries of the chemical elements of the periodic table. However, the countless stories lacked the threads that could have given them a common fabric.The periodic table, which is currently comprised of 118 elements (112 at the time the book was written), is an ongoing process. The number of elements in our 14 billion year old universe increased over time. Right after the Big Bang a couple of elements formed, but later through nuclear fusion in stars, and stellar explosions known as supernovas, created and released the other naturally occurring elements. The remaining elements in the periodic table are synthetic (woman-made / man-made). The book walks us through Mendeleev's periodic table of elements that is composed of the main ingredients that chemists, physicists, and other scientist use for their recipes and experiments. The author shares many amusing background stories on how numerous chemical elements were isolated and shaped the way wars were fought, politics conducted, and relationships impacted.We see how women, like Marie Skłodowska Curie, her daughter Irene, Lise Meitner, and others played a pivotal role in the evolution of the periodic table.The author also recognizes that science, as a whole, was greatly contributed by immigrants.Somewhere in the first quarter of the book an interesting question was asked by Kean and that is whether theory or experiments are responsible for the advancement of science? I wish this question was further elaborated. The reader will definitely walk away with a considerable amount of interesting information, but not enough understanding of the subject matter. The author spent almost the whole book informing, rather than teaching and challenging me to think. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting a tour of the chemical elements and their backstories.[I read the Montenegrin (Serbian / Croatian / Bosnian) translation Kašika koja nestaje - autor Sem Kin. Laguna 2018 Publishing / 459 pages / 111,901 words. Great translation.]"

It's not poorly written (though it ain't Solzhenitsyn) and it's not that uninteresting of a topic, but I just found that after the first 40ish pages, I dreaded having to read more. It was like pulling teeth, only a bit less painful, even without the option of novocaine.I think part of it was that the book wasn't well organized. The author seemed to jump around the periodic table at his whim without keeping a consistent framework (perhaps that was the point, it was a bit unclear to me). Anyway, the writing is OKish enough and it is certainly very well researched, so I can understand why many people have liked it. And it's really not a bad science book, but for some reason I just found myself having a viscerally negative reaction to having to read the next chapter (well I guess I didn't have to keep reading on, but whatever). I don't know, I wish I could pinpoint the source of my discontent with this, but it is what it is, so feel free to try it out for yourself."

I feel like I learned some things, which isn't that difficult of a feat since what I remember from my high school chemistry class has more to do with the people sitting near me (we called ourselves the Peanut Gallery). I have vague memories of a teacher, the great Thorstein Sabo, who tried to teach us about the periodic table by telling us stories about electrons playing cribbage in the electron hotel. I didn't really get it. This book groups different elements, and tells stories about them in context of political intrigue, devastating consequences, and lifesaving discoveries. Coincidentally, I am also reading Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age, a book with a lot of parallels to The Disappearing Spoon. Where The Disappearing Spoon demonstrates how war interrupts scientific process, Rites of Spring shows the same about war interfering in the arts. You have to wonder how much farther, or at least different, both science and the arts would be, had we never had the world wars consuming the first half of the twentieth century.The tiny pieces of information I didn't know would fill a book, this book. It would be impossible to even recite them, but I particularly enjoyed the story of argyria, silver poisoning, and the senate/governor hopeful who drank collodial silver in preparation for Y2K. Argyria turns your skin blue... permanently. Papa smurf!I also made a note to myself to check out the poet Lowell, who is one of the first people to be treated with Lithium for mental illness. Salt (not an element) was also put into perspective with Ghandi and enforced iodine and I just don't know whether to be grateful that my government is preventing birth defects or to be freaked out that they are adding things like iodine to salt and fluoride to the water. The audiobook was great for this. Sean Runnette has a unique voice that I enjoyed in zombie stories but still translated well to science!I will leave you with a song I could not get out of my head during my listen to the second half of the book."
71,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,3,"This book constipated my reading for almost a month. I have overdue fines from other books that were stacked up behind it. Not because I wasn't enjoying the book: it's readable, fascinating, and chock full of the very anecdotes about science and scientists that I love. So then, why the hell did I find this book so hard?It's precisely because the book is a collection of anecdotes that it was so hard to read. I felt like I was trying to grasp quicksilver (mercury, symbol Hg from Latin hydragyrum, meaning “water silver”) as this steady diet of atomic information arrived. Actually, that's a lousy metaphor: quicksilver is a glistening hypnotic liquid because its atoms stick together. These atomic anecdotes didn't: nothing stuck in my head, nothing stuck to each other. There was no overall organizing principle to the book that I could divine, and reluctantly I finished it barely the wiser than I begun.This book demands flashcards. I want to know the anecdotes. I want them to stick. I am going to have to work at it, however, beyond simply reading the book, if that is to happen."

This was an interesting look at history as told thru the periodic table. I can't really speak to the accuracy of the science but I really enjoyed reading all the tales. I recognized a lot of the science names but learned some knew things about them. The parts I found the most interesting were how great an effect WWII had on science and scientists and the parts about mental health and brain health.

Assumes a level of scientific knowledge not necessarily found in a casually curious science neophyte. IOW, way over my head. Rather hard to maintain focus and interest when you are barely understanding the composition of the simplest atoms. My take aways from the book are that the Periodic Table is drawn the way that it is beyond formatting choices. There are reasons that every element is located where it is on the table. The fact that the Periodic Table is mapped the way it is, is a scientific marvel. Also, Helium is the only element on the Periodic Table that doesn't combine with any other elements to form molecules. It sees itself as perfect. That's it. My sum total take away from the book. Some rather lucky and stupid scientists travails too...3.5ish rounded down because I forgot what element the disappearing spoon was. The stories didn't stick.Listened to the audiobook.

75,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/127002-ginger-k,2,"So far, not so great. The degree of anthropomorphizing of atoms in the introductory chapters has left me completely puzzled about the actual science involved. I have no idea what it means that oxygen is ""a bully."" Does oxygen shake down other atoms for electrons? How does that even work?However, the chapter on chemical warfare has been (disturbing but) interesting. If the rest of the book is historical-figures character-driven, rather than atomic character-driven, then my overall opinion of the book should improve. Ugh, spoke too soon. Most of the chapter discusses chemical warfare in Europe around the World Wars. Therefore, most of the chapter is about named individuals -- chemists and soldiers and heads of state. And then one gets to the last four pages which are about how the cell phone industry's demand for niobium and tantalum fed the war in the Congo... a war which is all tribalism and ancient grudges (unlike Europe's wars?). ""Gruesome stories have circulated about proud victors humiliating their victims' bodies by draping themselves with entrails and dancing in celebration."" Lurid detail, but with no names, no location, no citations. I wish I were kidding. Gruesome stories circulated about 'the Hun' during the war, too, but I didn't see those stories getting a whole lot of coverage in this science book and for good reason -- so why are the stories about Congolese atrocities getting uncritically repeated here? And then to just win at post-colonialism, he unironically quotes Joseph Conrad, who ""once called Congo, 'the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human consceince,' and there's little reason to revise that notion today."" Thank you ever so much for perpetuating the stereotypical images of the Dark Continent, images which don't need revising despite being a hundred years out of date."
76,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,Okay I will start by saying this is a fascinating book but you will need some understanding of the periodic table and chemistry - now I am not saying you need to be degree level but it will make some of the references a little easier to spot and the importance of some of the statements just that little more dramatic. That said and I have read a number of chemistry books both for fun and for academic reasons (yes okay I am chemist) but I did like how the author approached the subject of each chapter. I will admit that it did sort of follow a formula in that he would explain the focus of the chapter (which element or family of elements) a long with hints of entertaining stories and anecdotes. He would then go back to these stories and explain them further - with the idea that he would reinforce the message of each chapter. So I guess you would have the technical scholarly part followed by the humorous and entertaining story. For me I thought this was a great way of bringing the message home without either being boring or overbearing. This is a great book for those interested in chemistry. Yes by the nature of the book it focuses on the elements and little of their compounds (although it does talk about their chemistries) but its a great launch pad in to further studies 
77,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This book is quite an entertaining read. It is packed with interesting anecdotes about scientists who explored the outer fringes of the periodic table. I even learned a little bit of chemistry. The book is organized in an intelligent manner--each chapter is devoted to some theme, with a small group of elements that fit into that theme in some way. Sometimes the author strays from the exploration of elements, but he always seems to relate to the chapter's theme. The only thing that puts me off a bit, is the author's style. It is a rather folksy style, where the words ""um"", ""well"", and ""friggin"" can be found in the middle of a sentence."
78,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"In a breezy style, Kean intersperses chemistry and physics with a potpourri of stories revolving around the elements. He explains how the elements formed and how they were discovered. He blends complex science and human interest in his examples of how the elements have been used and influenced history. Kean transitions quickly from deep discussions of atomic structure or quantum mechanics to oddities such as the nutcase who turned blue eating silver because he thought there would be no antibiotics after Y2K. Kean tries to make difficult concepts comprehensible such as the fine structure constant and why it is so fundamental to our understanding of the universe. He also fills his book with obscure facts such as how many ounces of the element astatine there are on the earth. The answer is one. And if you find it, it will be gone before you can do anything with it. Kean serves up tidbits of the lives of the scientists including their personal and professional quirks and claims to fame. He focuses on the developers of the periodic table from Mendeleev who is credited with the original to Glenn Seaborg whose discoveries of super heavy elements expanded it. We learn about Linus Pauling’s unraveling of the structure of protein and his misguided attempt to be the first to crack the structure of DNA. Crick and Watson cagily won that race. He discusses the discovery of quantum mechanics from Max Planck’s initial findings about the spectral distribution of black body radiation to Einstein’s concept of energy as a particle and on through Bohr, Heisenberg and others. These are just a few of the brief vignettes of famous scientists in Kean’s book. The Disappearing Spoon is full of good stuff for those who want their science lightened up by entertaining sidebars. It’s a bit of a teaser. Kean gives you just enough to get interested in a topic. So I found myself frequently going on line or considering getting something more in depth. The book’s diversity makes it a great way to find something new you might want to know more about. It’s also the perfect book for readers with short attention spans."
79,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"This book was lots of fun, and it certainly taught me more than I ever learned in high school chemistry class. Quite honestly, if someone had asked me for a definition of ""chemistry"" before, I don't think I would have known what to say. At the same time, The Disappearing Spoon wasn't like a lecture in the least bit, and instead folded tons of scientific information into stories about the scientists and their accomplishments. I'd recommend it to anyone who's curious about a subject they may have only encountered at the 101 level."
80,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3548626-ian-tregillis,4,"This is a rare specimen among the books I tend to read: a two-bookmark book. I was skeptical when this first came to my attention. I grew up reading any and every science-related book I could find. My early fascination with books about science -- particularly chemistry and physics -- led, many years later, to my day job career. (I also blame Dr. Who for this, but that's a longer story.) But it was a long road, and not surprisingly along the way I lost my enthusiasm for reading books about science topics in my spare time. I always have, and always will, love the fact that people are writing and reading them. But somewhere, along the way to becoming an adult, the stuff I used to love as a kid started to feel like... homework. Like taking my work home with me.I thought a book filled with strange anecdotes related to the Periodic Table sounded like a terrific idea for folks that would be interested in such things. But that I would not be one of those people. This, in spite of the fact that when I was much younger (before I finally got to learn about all the stuff I wanted to learn) I used to spend hours staring at the Periodic Table, studying it, trying and failing to unpack its arcane secrets. (And yet somehow I'd completely forgotten about that until I read this book. This book deserves four stars just on the basis of helping me remember this.) Eventually I learned about the mathematics of atoms, and how this gives rise to the Periodic Table. And it was glorious. But then I grew up. Life as an adult is heavy on the mortgage payments, lighter on the soul-stirring wonderment.So, yeah. I figured I didn't need to read a book about the table because I already knew how it worked. It's still true I didn't need to read this book, but the 10-year-old inside me sure did. I'm glad I listened to him.Sam Kean (who, judging from his photo on the rear flap, could be a friend's lost twin) adopts a casual, easygoing tone, which keeps the book easily readable, even when the subject matter might become dry in less capable hands. He touches on the scientific underpinnings of the subject when necessary yet never gets bogged down in the weeds. And though he glosses over the details in places (as is the only right thing to do in a book like this) his explanations make for clear, concise distillations of the subject matter. Never did I find myself tempted to skim, even when I was familiar with the background details. I'd heard a few of the stories in this book, but only a few, and those I'd either misremembered or learned incorrectly in the first place. Much of the information in this book was new to me, but all of it was fascinating. This is much more than a book about the elements and the table upon which they reside; it's also a book about the people who discovered them, loved them, hated them, yearned for them, tried to recreate them. As such, it's filled with remarkable and fascinating tidbits. I didn't know that exposure to tellurium can make a person reek like garlic. I didn't know that beryllium tastes like sugar. (Where I work, the eating of beryllium is discouraged.) I didn't know about the World War I fight over a nearly defunct mine in Colorado. I didn't know that Fritz Haber was such an epic tool. I didn't know that the ""S"" of the BCS theory of superconductivity went to prison.Much of the most fascinating and entertaining material is tucked away in extensive footnotes. The footnote section is worth reading just on its own. The author clearly couldn't resist including many of the little tidbits he'd learned in the course of his research. But rather than breaking the logical development of each section with a tangential anecdote, he leaves the digressions to the footnote section. This section is worth reading just on its own. The notes appear so frequently that I needed two bookmarks, so that I could flip back and forth between the body text and the footnotes section. If you do decide to pick this up, absolutely do not skip the footnotes. Some of the best stuff is in there. Much of it isn't strictly related to the periodic table, but it's golden just the same.The book is organized logically, following the first attempts to classify the elements through to cutting-edge speculations about the ""island of stability"", quantum dots, and other current topics. Each chapter is organized around a theme -- Elements in Times of War, Elements as Money, The Elements of Madness, Poisoner's Corner, etc. The narrative thread of each chapter weaves its way through multiple boxes on the periodic table. (In a lovely piece of book design, the periodic table entries for the relevant elements appear at the top of each chapter.) Kean does an enviable job of developing each chapter logically, and deserves much credit for finding such clean paths through what could have become thickets. In a few places, the narrative's relationship to the chapter theme felt a little forced. But the information along the way is so fun, and presented so well, that I never cared. "
81,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063661-woodge,4,"This book was an interesting compendium of stories linking up the various elements of the Periodic Table. Not only did I learn about the various scientists who discovered this or that element, but I learned a good deal about many of the elements themselves. It was entertaining enough that I kept coming back to it to read more. I've got a much better understanding now of elements and what makes them differ from each other. And I didn't even realize that elements can change (or decay) into other elements. Never really thought about it, I guess. Now I know how it can happen (though not every element does this.) Lots of cool facts and odd stories about odd scientists are embedded in this book. Recommended for anyone interested in science, especially those without a Ph.D. It's rocks for jocks. "

It makes chemistry and physics comprehensible and fun. I listened to it in audio and thought the narrator did a fantastic job with it. He actually made the jokes sound funny. He knew what tone the author was striving for and he hit it spot-on. However, I think I ended up missing a lot by listening rather than reading. The book is so packed full of fun facts and numbers and, of course, references to the periodic table. I'm sure there were charts and diagrams I just didn't get in an audiobook.

The Periodic Table! Chemistry! How could I possibly be completely enthralled by such a book? How could I dare give it five stars when I wasn't able to truly understand a lot of what I read?Because of the writing, pure and simple.Kean makes chemistry accessible for the willing-to-make-an-intellectual-effort layperson - but it's not just the chemistry. It's the characters BEHIND the chemistry, the stories of their discoveries and the things they overlooked. It's about the politics and the culture and the drama of the creation of that little set of boxes that we're all so familiar with.I was fascinated.I have found myself sharing little anecdotes with my (yes, young) children and my friends. I pulled out the book at dinner tonight and had to tell the story of that ""disappearing spoon"" to everyone at the table. I loved the history, both in our modern world and the earth itself. It feels like this knowledge is so essential to human life, that these things he is talking about are, literally, at the root of what we're all made of and Kean is just able to share that information in an interesting and not-your-stuffy-old-professor style.Yes, there is a lot of science in there, but don't be scared though. You can still get so much out of the stories if you're willing to let yourself gloss over the really deep stuff and just glean as much out of it as you can.

While I enjoyed it (and learned a lot of history of science trivia I'd been unaware of, what with my head stuck in the 18th century) and had a few ""a-ha"" moments as some organic chemistry concepts FINALLY made sense to me (14 years after my last ochem class), I have two big problems with the book. -1 star because the book needed editing. Badly. Kean's writing is usually OK, but sometimes forced, folksy, and pedantic. I could go from enjoyment to annoyance to wanting to throw it across the room and/or get out my red pen. -1 star because there is no comprehensive bibliography, which is a cardinal sin in a book about science, just a short list of books. I have no doubt he did a lot of research, but there should be *some* accountability. Instead, in endnotes, there are more folksy stories (that require flipping to the back of the book to read, and which were usually only tangential and not particularly interesting footnotes to the main story, meaning the flow was disrupted for no good reason). In any case: interesting topic, good stories, only OK execution, and little authorial accountability. I really can't see myself reading anything Kean writes in the future unless he cites his sources and drops the folksy facade. "

He writes with humour and enthusiasm, pulling out interesting characters and discoveries from the history of the Periodic Table and its elements.I’m just not as into chemistry/physics as I am biology. Even organic chemistry. I should be, but, alas. So I found that this dragged a bit — for me. It’d probably be unfair to assume it’d drag for you as well, if you’re actually a fan of chemistry.Originally reviewed on my blog."
90,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,4,"Stop the search. Recall the teams. I have found the non-fiction, summer read of 2010! The Disappearing Spoon.First, what’s a summer read, Mr. Josey Wales thumbnail photo? A summer read is one you can enjoy during a vacation to the beach, with fresh cocktails and clean towels provided by the swarthy, bronzed attendant at a seafront hotel. You can finish it in a few days in bite-sized chunks, it doesn’t overpower you academically, you learn a little, and the subject is something entirely new to you, which allows you to ‘escape’ mentally just as you are physically from that 50-hour, weekly cubicle career and hateful commuter traffic.The book catalogues the 200 year history of the piecemeal development of the periodic table in chemistry. Wait, this is not your high school chemistry class! Sam Kean uses the most idiosyncratic, unusual, serendipitous, and funny events to tell this story. You learn as much about the brilliant, boisterous, bi-polar, bastardly, and braggadocio scientists as you learn about each element on the periodic table. Each of 19 chapters pulls together several periodic elements and outlines their unexpected similarity and relatedness--atomically, quantumly and culturally. And the narrative moves fluidly back and forth through time to capture the relevant history of each element. The book highlights discoveries that are still being made, current as of late 2009.Strontium, Molybdenum, Ruthenium, Francium, Ytterbium. Neptunium, Berkelium, Californium, Lawrencium. What are you all about? How were you discovered? Why are you so important? And why the heck are you so rare? This is neat science told in a fun and effervescent way. There are some awesome, awe-inspiring, and yet sometimes pedestrian, elements out there. Science ofttimes moves forward in jumps and spurts, and Kean is quick to relate how it moves chaotically, unexpectedly, bizarrely, and accidentally. The author reviews not just core chemistry but also history, physics, cosmology, and psychology. The scientists and their Rube Goldberg experiments are as interesting as the results. Periodic elements are really cool (yes, I actually said that). They’re phenomenal, toxic, powerful, rare, ephemeral, magical, radioactive, and have the most interesting relationships to each other. We’re told why, when, and how they’ve been used and abused through history, and how they shepherded great leaps in the advancement of human civilization.The Disappearing Spoon is quick, light reading out in the sun. It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way. Kean uses good rhythm in the book, chapters of uniform length, and a bit of humor to bring it all home. He pulls it off effectively--Mr Wizard meets chaos theory. Sixth grade, mall, ‘wow’-science is discussed right next to the paragraph about how to produce absolute zero or 35 million degrees, both of which, incidentally, are created by lasers.In the end, you’ll learn a little, laugh a little. You may not remember anything from this book 2 years from now, but you will retain this: elements are neat as hell, and thank goodness for chemists and physicists. New words: depilatory, eluted"
91,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,0,"My GR friend Jason writes sturdy and trustworthy reviews, but I must take exception with him here :The Disappearing Spoon is quick, light reading out in the sun. It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way.Yes, it is all that, IF such stuff as this makes sense to you :The strongest solo acid is still the boron-based carborane (HCB11C111) And this boron acid has the best punchline so far : it's simultaneously the world's strongest and gentlest acid. To wrap your head around that, remember that acids split into positive and negative parts. In carborane's case you get H+ and an elaborate cagelike structure formed by everything else (CB11C111-) With most acids it's the negative portion that's corrosive and caustic and eats through the skin. But the boron cage forms one of the most stable molecules ever invented. Its boron atoms share electrons so generously that it practically becomes helium, and it won't go around ripping electrons from other atoms, the usual cause of acidic carnage.Well, this could be part of the rules of Quidditch for all the sense it makes to poor general reader me, so I think The Disappearing Spoon is really for science geeks who think stuff about German chemists being hornswoggled out of a Nobel Prize for Alchemy by some Californian sharpies in 1951 or a neat account of the crucial properties of the biomolecule which are called handedness is the very thing for those moments on the beach when there isn't any eye candy around."
92,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3504278-kate,4,"Okay. Let me tell it to you honestly.This book is not the most well written book - the sentences are clunky and there is not a clear narrative. It is much more of a rambling collection of stories and facts and quirky science knowledge.That said, I couldn't get back to reading this fast enough. I thought about a book about the scientific table throughout the day. I stole a few minutes wherever I could. I carried this book with me and was even *gasp* early to pick up the kids so that I could read a few minutes in the car.I mean, the opening factoid is about our ability to trace Lewis & Clark's trail by following the mercury laced poop trail. I love that shit. Growing up, I never loved science. I didn't learn the periodic table in school like others did. And so, there were times in this book, where I only understood a few clauses in each paragraph because the concepts were so advanced, but the author did a great job of bringing it back to a laypersons' comprehension in the next paragraph. So, in summary, this book is written for all levels of science (or not) nerds. It is full of incredible tales and the fun secrets and stories of the people involved in the development of the periodic table (and science as we know it).I will absolutely be rereading this book - most definitely when the boys are learning the periodic table in school."
93,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,4,"This is an absolutely brilliant idea for a book and it’s a superb book. It’s beautifully organized and well written. It’s a wonderful way to learn and/or deepen knowledge of chemistry. This book is fine for laypeople, but will give meaning and extra enjoyment even for advanced chemistry students. Much appreciated by me was that the information imparted was over my head only a very few times, and that’s saying a lot, because I’ve never taken a chemistry class.This book covers the elements of the periodic table via its history and by telling stories about the various elements: their history of discovery, how they’ve been used at various times, various people who found ways to make use of them. Anyone with a smidgen of curiosity about any aspect of life should find many things here that they find interesting. So many subjects are covered including astronomy, war, South Pole exploration, health and illness and poisoning, history, other sciences, the personalities of those who have contributed to the findings in the field, and so much more. It’s jam packed with useful facts and enjoyable stories. The relevance of the elements (chemistry) in everyday life is made so clear.There are many lovely digressions that turn out not to be digressions at all. There were very amusing parts, including funny quips that frequently pop up, and all of those quips have substance. It has a sort of gossipy (in a good way) tone. I learned so much. I found out that I love Linus Pauling and many other scientists who’ve contributed to the field. I was surprised how much of what’s been discovered in the field of chemistry has been done fairly recently, and how it’s still a growing, living scientific endeavor. While I’ve always been interested in science, and I did want a chemistry set when I was a child (request denied), I knew deplorably little about chemistry. Like the author, I loved playing with growing balls of mercury from broken thermometers. Quite a few of the elements themselves were, of course, familiar to me, but I didn’t know much about them. I had a bit of chemistry in other college science classes and in nutrition class. As I read, I frequently wished I’d memorized the table before reading this book. There is a table of the elements in the back of the book but it includes abbreviations only; it is not embellished; there is no list of elements by name next to it. However, in the index, thankfully, the elements are listed in bold, and I referred to that index at the beginning of every chapter when some elements were listed, in what looked to me like unusual Scrabble tiles. I read the notes as I read along, and they were easy to find because they started with page number and beginning of phrase in bold as a match their section in the book, but I’d still rather they’d have been included in the text proper to make the information even easier to read and to make it flow more smoothly.This book should be part of every beginning chemistry class. It makes the subject so interesting. This is certainly not the only attempt to make chemistry a great deal of fun for everyone. The book mentions the Tom Lehrer song, The Elements (which can be seen in many places including here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYW50F...).I really enjoyed this book, although I did end up reading it slowly, and I did take one break to read the young adult novel Mockingjay, which I’d been waiting to read for nearly a year.This is a gem of a book and such a great idea. I adored the humor, and there was a lot of it. I’ll let readers see for themselves why the book’s title is what it is.I hope that Sam Kean (or someone) writes similar books about physics, mathematics, etc. etc. I would definitely read them if they were as clever as this book."

What a lot of baloney! The Disappearing Spoon is, quite literally, one of the most fascinating, informative, FUNNY, books about the Periodic Table that I've ever read. Okay, it is the only book about the Periodic Table that I've ever read - but it is amazing. For those who love science or for those who simply would like to better under the elements that make the cosmos what it is, then this is a must read for you!! As for the ""disappearing spoon"" trick - well, you'll just have to read the book to find out the secret to this parlor trick for yourself! You'll be glad that you did! "
95,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"There's a certain type of goodreads troll -- the one who defends their beloved book by saying something like, ""Well, if you knew the topic didn't interest you why were you stupid enough to pick up the book?"" To that goodreads troll I now have an answer: this book.If you had told me a few weeks ago that I'd find a book about chemistry and the periodic table of elements difficult to put down, I'd have had a hard time believing you. But I did. This book was funny, interesting, even gripping at times, and always engaging. I took off a star because I'll admit that I didn't get all of it despite the author's best efforts. I guess it would take more than a fun book to turn me into a chemistry person. But it was still a wonderful read, and not a guilty pleasure because it was actually educational. This meant I could feel virtuous for once while I ignored my various responsibilities in favor of more reading.So not only did I get to enjoy a good book, I feel vindicated in my ongoing belief that a a sufficiently good writer can make any topic interesting, even to a reluctant reader. Yes – sometimes it pays to leave your reading comfort zone. And when it doesn’t, you have every right to complain because it is about the book, not just about a personal bias with regard to the content. For a good book, there should be no such thing as a “right” or “wrong” reader."
96,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431873-emily,3,"This book took me 76 days, or almost three months, to read. In this case, I needed all seventy-six individual days to work my brain through passages like this one:
For instance, thirteen aluminium atoms grouped together in the right way do a killer bromine: the two entities are indistinguishable in chemical reactions. This happens despite the cluster being thirteen times larger than a single bromine atom and despite aluminium being nothing like the lacrimatory poison-gas staple ... The clusters work like this. The atoms arrange themselves into a three-dimensional polyhedron, and each atom in it mimics a proton and a neutron in a collective nucleus. The caveat is that electrons can flow around inside this soft nucleic blob, and the atoms share the electrons collectively. Scientists wryly call this state of matter ""jellium.""
All you need to know is that I'm sort of an idiot. If you read the above passage and thought, ""This makes perfect sense! What an appropriate way to explain jellium, a state I've always been interested in!"", then you are less of an idiot than me and will probably enjoy this book very much. To give more context, here's how much of an idiot I am: when I took physics at Stanford (on the way to my successful minor! ha!), I had a lot of trouble with electricity and optics. To study, I did literally every single problem from those chapters, and I did the word problems multiple times. When I got to the final, I immediately recognized one of the problems I had done at least four times, was jubilant for about 2 seconds, and then realized I had absolutely no idea how to do it. (I think I only got half credit.) That is how good I am at squashing scientific concepts into my brain. On the positive side, I find all of this very interesting, and because I forget it so quickly, I have a lifetime of renewed discoveries ahead of me."

I was fascinated by the many details about the hunt for elements, the private lives of the Curies, the radioactive boy scout, the dangers of storing rare elements in the Congo, and that the same man who invented nitrogen rich fertilizers, is also the inventor of zyklon B. It also made me want to read more about The Manhattan Project, so I guess its time to put the Rhodes book on my wishlist."

This book is rich in empirical evidence and interesting tales of the last 200 years of history and discoveries of the chemical elements of the periodic table. However, the countless stories lacked the threads that could have given them a common fabric.The periodic table, which is currently comprised of 118 elements (112 at the time the book was written), is an ongoing process. The number of elements in our 14 billion year old universe increased over time. Right after the Big Bang a couple of elements formed, but later through nuclear fusion in stars, and stellar explosions known as supernovas, created and released the other naturally occurring elements. The remaining elements in the periodic table are synthetic (woman-made / man-made). The book walks us through Mendeleev's periodic table of elements that is composed of the main ingredients that chemists, physicists, and other scientist use for their recipes and experiments. The author shares many amusing background stories on how numerous chemical elements were isolated and shaped the way wars were fought, politics conducted, and relationships impacted.We see how women, like Marie Skłodowska Curie, her daughter Irene, Lise Meitner, and others played a pivotal role in the evolution of the periodic table.The author also recognizes that science, as a whole, was greatly contributed by immigrants.Somewhere in the first quarter of the book an interesting question was asked by Kean and that is whether theory or experiments are responsible for the advancement of science? I wish this question was further elaborated. The reader will definitely walk away with a considerable amount of interesting information, but not enough understanding of the subject matter. The author spent almost the whole book informing, rather than teaching and challenging me to think. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting a tour of the chemical elements and their backstories.[I read the Montenegrin (Serbian / Croatian / Bosnian) translation Kašika koja nestaje - autor Sem Kin. Laguna 2018 Publishing / 459 pages / 111,901 words. Great translation.]"
99,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,2,"I should have liked this book more and I can't really explain why I didn't. It's not poorly written (though it ain't Solzhenitsyn) and it's not that uninteresting of a topic, but I just found that after the first 40ish pages, I dreaded having to read more. It was like pulling teeth, only a bit less painful, even without the option of novocaine.I think part of it was that the book wasn't well organized. The author seemed to jump around the periodic table at his whim without keeping a consistent framework (perhaps that was the point, it was a bit unclear to me). Anyway, the writing is OKish enough and it is certainly very well researched, so I can understand why many people have liked it. And it's really not a bad science book, but for some reason I just found myself having a viscerally negative reaction to having to read the next chapter (well I guess I didn't have to keep reading on, but whatever). I don't know, I wish I could pinpoint the source of my discontent with this, but it is what it is, so feel free to try it out for yourself."

I feel like I learned some things, which isn't that difficult of a feat since what I remember from my high school chemistry class has more to do with the people sitting near me (we called ourselves the Peanut Gallery). I have vague memories of a teacher, the great Thorstein Sabo, who tried to teach us about the periodic table by telling us stories about electrons playing cribbage in the electron hotel. I didn't really get it. This book groups different elements, and tells stories about them in context of political intrigue, devastating consequences, and lifesaving discoveries. Coincidentally, I am also reading Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age, a book with a lot of parallels to The Disappearing Spoon. Where The Disappearing Spoon demonstrates how war interrupts scientific process, Rites of Spring shows the same about war interfering in the arts. You have to wonder how much farther, or at least different, both science and the arts would be, had we never had the world wars consuming the first half of the twentieth century.The tiny pieces of information I didn't know would fill a book, this book. It would be impossible to even recite them, but I particularly enjoyed the story of argyria, silver poisoning, and the senate/governor hopeful who drank collodial silver in preparation for Y2K. Argyria turns your skin blue... permanently. Papa smurf!I also made a note to myself to check out the poet Lowell, who is one of the first people to be treated with Lithium for mental illness. Salt (not an element) was also put into perspective with Ghandi and enforced iodine and I just don't know whether to be grateful that my government is preventing birth defects or to be freaked out that they are adding things like iodine to salt and fluoride to the water. The audiobook was great for this. Sean Runnette has a unique voice that I enjoyed in zombie stories but still translated well to science!I will leave you with a song I could not get out of my head during my listen to the second half of the book."
101,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,3,"This book constipated my reading for almost a month. I have overdue fines from other books that were stacked up behind it. Not because I wasn't enjoying the book: it's readable, fascinating, and chock full of the very anecdotes about science and scientists that I love. So then, why the hell did I find this book so hard?It's precisely because the book is a collection of anecdotes that it was so hard to read. I felt like I was trying to grasp quicksilver (mercury, symbol Hg from Latin hydragyrum, meaning “water silver”) as this steady diet of atomic information arrived. Actually, that's a lousy metaphor: quicksilver is a glistening hypnotic liquid because its atoms stick together. These atomic anecdotes didn't: nothing stuck in my head, nothing stuck to each other. There was no overall organizing principle to the book that I could divine, and reluctantly I finished it barely the wiser than I begun.This book demands flashcards. I want to know the anecdotes. I want them to stick. I am going to have to work at it, however, beyond simply reading the book, if that is to happen."

This was an interesting look at history as told thru the periodic table. I can't really speak to the accuracy of the science but I really enjoyed reading all the tales. I recognized a lot of the science names but learned some knew things about them. The parts I found the most interesting were how great an effect WWII had on science and scientists and the parts about mental health and brain health.

Assumes a level of scientific knowledge not necessarily found in a casually curious science neophyte. IOW, way over my head. Rather hard to maintain focus and interest when you are barely understanding the composition of the simplest atoms. My take aways from the book are that the Periodic Table is drawn the way that it is beyond formatting choices. There are reasons that every element is located where it is on the table. The fact that the Periodic Table is mapped the way it is, is a scientific marvel. Also, Helium is the only element on the Periodic Table that doesn't combine with any other elements to form molecules. It sees itself as perfect. That's it. My sum total take away from the book. Some rather lucky and stupid scientists travails too...3.5ish rounded down because I forgot what element the disappearing spoon was. The stories didn't stick.Listened to the audiobook.

The degree of anthropomorphizing of atoms in the introductory chapters has left me completely puzzled about the actual science involved. I have no idea what it means that oxygen is ""a bully."" Does oxygen shake down other atoms for electrons? How does that even work?However, the chapter on chemical warfare has been (disturbing but) interesting. If the rest of the book is historical-figures character-driven, rather than atomic character-driven, then my overall opinion of the book should improve. Ugh, spoke too soon. Most of the chapter discusses chemical warfare in Europe around the World Wars. Therefore, most of the chapter is about named individuals -- chemists and soldiers and heads of state. And then one gets to the last four pages which are about how the cell phone industry's demand for niobium and tantalum fed the war in the Congo... a war which is all tribalism and ancient grudges (unlike Europe's wars?). ""Gruesome stories have circulated about proud victors humiliating their victims' bodies by draping themselves with entrails and dancing in celebration."" Lurid detail, but with no names, no location, no citations. I wish I were kidding. Gruesome stories circulated about 'the Hun' during the war, too, but I didn't see those stories getting a whole lot of coverage in this science book and for good reason -- so why are the stories about Congolese atrocities getting uncritically repeated here? And then to just win at post-colonialism, he unironically quotes Joseph Conrad, who ""once called Congo, 'the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human consceince,' and there's little reason to revise that notion today.""

106,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,Okay I will start by saying this is a fascinating book but you will need some understanding of the periodic table and chemistry - now I am not saying you need to be degree level but it will make some of the references a little easier to spot and the importance of some of the statements just that little more dramatic. That said and I have read a number of chemistry books both for fun and for academic reasons (yes okay I am chemist) but I did like how the author approached the subject of each chapter. I will admit that it did sort of follow a formula in that he would explain the focus of the chapter (which element or family of elements) a long with hints of entertaining stories and anecdotes. He would then go back to these stories and explain them further - with the idea that he would reinforce the message of each chapter. So I guess you would have the technical scholarly part followed by the humorous and entertaining story. For me I thought this was a great way of bringing the message home without either being boring or overbearing. This is a great book for those interested in chemistry. Yes by the nature of the book it focuses on the elements and little of their compounds (although it does talk about their chemistries) but its a great launch pad in to further studies 
107,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This book is quite an entertaining read. It is packed with interesting anecdotes about scientists who explored the outer fringes of the periodic table. I even learned a little bit of chemistry. The book is organized in an intelligent manner--each chapter is devoted to some theme, with a small group of elements that fit into that theme in some way. Sometimes the author strays from the exploration of elements, but he always seems to relate to the chapter's theme. The only thing that puts me off a bit, is the author's style. It is a rather folksy style, where the words ""um"", ""well"", and ""friggin"" can be found in the middle of a sentence."
108,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"In a breezy style, Kean intersperses chemistry and physics with a potpourri of stories revolving around the elements. He explains how the elements formed and how they were discovered. He blends complex science and human interest in his examples of how the elements have been used and influenced history. Kean transitions quickly from deep discussions of atomic structure or quantum mechanics to oddities such as the nutcase who turned blue eating silver because he thought there would be no antibiotics after Y2K. Kean tries to make difficult concepts comprehensible such as the fine structure constant and why it is so fundamental to our understanding of the universe. He also fills his book with obscure facts such as how many ounces of the element astatine there are on the earth. The answer is one. And if you find it, it will be gone before you can do anything with it. Kean serves up tidbits of the lives of the scientists including their personal and professional quirks and claims to fame. He focuses on the developers of the periodic table from Mendeleev who is credited with the original to Glenn Seaborg whose discoveries of super heavy elements expanded it. We learn about Linus Pauling’s unraveling of the structure of protein and his misguided attempt to be the first to crack the structure of DNA. Crick and Watson cagily won that race. He discusses the discovery of quantum mechanics from Max Planck’s initial findings about the spectral distribution of black body radiation to Einstein’s concept of energy as a particle and on through Bohr, Heisenberg and others. These are just a few of the brief vignettes of famous scientists in Kean’s book. The Disappearing Spoon is full of good stuff for those who want their science lightened up by entertaining sidebars. It’s a bit of a teaser. Kean gives you just enough to get interested in a topic. So I found myself frequently going on line or considering getting something more in depth. The book’s diversity makes it a great way to find something new you might want to know more about. It’s also the perfect book for readers with short attention spans."

Quite honestly, if someone had asked me for a definition of ""chemistry"" before, I don't think I would have known what to say. At the same time, The Disappearing Spoon wasn't like a lecture in the least bit, and instead folded tons of scientific information into stories about the scientists and their accomplishments. I'd recommend it to anyone who's curious about a subject they may have only encountered at the 101 level."

I was skeptical when this first came to my attention. I grew up reading any and every science-related book I could find. My early fascination with books about science -- particularly chemistry and physics -- led, many years later, to my day job career. (I also blame Dr. Who for this, but that's a longer story.) But it was a long road, and not surprisingly along the way I lost my enthusiasm for reading books about science topics in my spare time. I always have, and always will, love the fact that people are writing and reading them. But somewhere, along the way to becoming an adult, the stuff I used to love as a kid started to feel like... homework. Like taking my work home with me.I thought a book filled with strange anecdotes related to the Periodic Table sounded like a terrific idea for folks that would be interested in such things. But that I would not be one of those people. This, in spite of the fact that when I was much younger (before I finally got to learn about all the stuff I wanted to learn) I used to spend hours staring at the Periodic Table, studying it, trying and failing to unpack its arcane secrets. (And yet somehow I'd completely forgotten about that until I read this book. This book deserves four stars just on the basis of helping me remember this.) Eventually I learned about the mathematics of atoms, and how this gives rise to the Periodic Table. And it was glorious. But then I grew up. Life as an adult is heavy on the mortgage payments, lighter on the soul-stirring wonderment.So, yeah. I figured I didn't need to read a book about the table because I already knew how it worked. It's still true I didn't need to read this book, but the 10-year-old inside me sure did. I'm glad I listened to him.Sam Kean (who, judging from his photo on the rear flap, could be a friend's lost twin) adopts a casual, easygoing tone, which keeps the book easily readable, even when the subject matter might become dry in less capable hands. He touches on the scientific underpinnings of the subject when necessary yet never gets bogged down in the weeds. And though he glosses over the details in places (as is the only right thing to do in a book like this) his explanations make for clear, concise distillations of the subject matter. Never did I find myself tempted to skim, even when I was familiar with the background details. I'd heard a few of the stories in this book, but only a few, and those I'd either misremembered or learned incorrectly in the first place. Much of the information in this book was new to me, but all of it was fascinating. This is much more than a book about the elements and the table upon which they reside; it's also a book about the people who discovered them, loved them, hated them, yearned for them, tried to recreate them. As such, it's filled with remarkable and fascinating tidbits. I didn't know that exposure to tellurium can make a person reek like garlic. I didn't know that beryllium tastes like sugar. (Where I work, the eating of beryllium is discouraged.) I didn't know about the World War I fight over a nearly defunct mine in Colorado. I didn't know that Fritz Haber was such an epic tool. I didn't know that the ""S"" of the BCS theory of superconductivity went to prison.Much of the most fascinating and entertaining material is tucked away in extensive footnotes. The footnote section is worth reading just on its own. The author clearly couldn't resist including many of the little tidbits he'd learned in the course of his research. But rather than breaking the logical development of each section with a tangential anecdote, he leaves the digressions to the footnote section. This section is worth reading just on its own. The notes appear so frequently that I needed two bookmarks, so that I could flip back and forth between the body text and the footnotes section. If you do decide to pick this up, absolutely do not skip the footnotes. Some of the best stuff is in there. Much of it isn't strictly related to the periodic table, but it's golden just the same.The book is organized logically, following the first attempts to classify the elements through to cutting-edge speculations about the ""island of stability"", quantum dots, and other current topics. Each chapter is organized around a theme -- Elements in Times of War, Elements as Money, The Elements of Madness, Poisoner's Corner, etc. The narrative thread of each chapter weaves its way through multiple boxes on the periodic table. (In a lovely piece of book design, the periodic table entries for the relevant elements appear at the top of each chapter.) Kean does an enviable job of developing each chapter logically, and deserves much credit for finding such clean paths through what could have become thickets. In a few places, the narrative's relationship to the chapter theme felt a little forced. But the information along the way is so fun, and presented so well, that I never cared. "
111,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063661-woodge,4,"This book was an interesting compendium of stories linking up the various elements of the Periodic Table. Not only did I learn about the various scientists who discovered this or that element, but I learned a good deal about many of the elements themselves. It was entertaining enough that I kept coming back to it to read more. I've got a much better understanding now of elements and what makes them differ from each other. And I didn't even realize that elements can change (or decay) into other elements. Never really thought about it, I guess. Now I know how it can happen (though not every element does this.) Lots of cool facts and odd stories about odd scientists are embedded in this book. Recommended for anyone interested in science, especially those without a Ph.D. It's rocks for jocks. "

It makes chemistry and physics comprehensible and fun. I listened to it in audio and thought the narrator did a fantastic job with it. He actually made the jokes sound funny. He knew what tone the author was striving for and he hit it spot-on. However, I think I ended up missing a lot by listening rather than reading. The book is so packed full of fun facts and numbers and, of course, references to the periodic table. I'm sure there were charts and diagrams I just didn't get in an audiobook. Plus, my attention would wander and I would completely lose track of what was being discussed.I think I'm going to get a copy of this when it comes out in paperback.

The Periodic Table! Chemistry! How could I possibly be completely enthralled by such a book? How could I dare give it five stars when I wasn't able to truly understand a lot of what I read?Because of the writing, pure and simple.Kean makes chemistry accessible for the willing-to-make-an-intellectual-effort layperson - but it's not just the chemistry. It's the characters BEHIND the chemistry, the stories of their discoveries and the things they overlooked. It's about the politics and the culture and the drama of the creation of that little set of boxes that we're all so familiar with.I was fascinated.I have found myself sharing little anecdotes with my (yes, young) children and my friends. I pulled out the book at dinner tonight and had to tell the story of that ""disappearing spoon"" to everyone at the table. I loved the history, both in our modern world and the earth itself. It feels like this knowledge is so essential to human life, that these things he is talking about are, literally, at the root of what we're all made of and Kean is just able to share that information in an interesting and not-your-stuffy-old-professor style.Yes, there is a lot of science in there, but don't be scared though. You can still get so much out of the stories if you're willing to let yourself gloss over the really deep stuff and just glean as much out of it as you can. I'm going to return my copy to the library and then buy my own, so I can read parts of it again. I liked it that much. "
118,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5310185-qoh,3,"This book takes a monumental topic -- the periodic table -- and breaks it down into various digestible topic areas. While I enjoyed it (and learned a lot of history of science trivia I'd been unaware of, what with my head stuck in the 18th century) and had a few ""a-ha"" moments as some organic chemistry concepts FINALLY made sense to me (14 years after my last ochem class), I have two big problems with the book. -1 star because the book needed editing. Badly. Kean's writing is usually OK, but sometimes forced, folksy, and pedantic. I could go from enjoyment to annoyance to wanting to throw it across the room and/or get out my red pen. -1 star because there is no comprehensive bibliography, which is a cardinal sin in a book about science, just a short list of books. I have no doubt he did a lot of research, but there should be *some* accountability. Instead, in endnotes, there are more folksy stories (that require flipping to the back of the book to read, and which were usually only tangential and not particularly interesting footnotes to the main story, meaning the flow was disrupted for no good reason). In any case: interesting topic, good stories, only OK execution, and little authorial accountability. I really can't see myself reading anything Kean writes in the future unless he cites his sources and drops the folksy facade. "

There’s all kinds of random facts, and he makes things like electron shells very clear — even for me, with my brain’s stubborn refusal to grasp it all. He writes with humour and enthusiasm, pulling out interesting characters and discoveries from the history of the Periodic Table and its elements.I’m just not as into chemistry/physics as I am biology. Even organic chemistry. I should be, but, alas. So I found that this dragged a bit — for me. It’d probably be unfair to assume it’d drag for you as well, if you’re actually a fan of chemistry.Originally reviewed on my blog."
120,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,4,"Stop the search. Recall the teams. I have found the non-fiction, summer read of 2010! The Disappearing Spoon.First, what’s a summer read, Mr. Josey Wales thumbnail photo? A summer read is one you can enjoy during a vacation to the beach, with fresh cocktails and clean towels provided by the swarthy, bronzed attendant at a seafront hotel. You can finish it in a few days in bite-sized chunks, it doesn’t overpower you academically, you learn a little, and the subject is something entirely new to you, which allows you to ‘escape’ mentally just as you are physically from that 50-hour, weekly cubicle career and hateful commuter traffic.The book catalogues the 200 year history of the piecemeal development of the periodic table in chemistry. Wait, this is not your high school chemistry class! Sam Kean uses the most idiosyncratic, unusual, serendipitous, and funny events to tell this story. You learn as much about the brilliant, boisterous, bi-polar, bastardly, and braggadocio scientists as you learn about each element on the periodic table. Each of 19 chapters pulls together several periodic elements and outlines their unexpected similarity and relatedness--atomically, quantumly and culturally. And the narrative moves fluidly back and forth through time to capture the relevant history of each element. The book highlights discoveries that are still being made, current as of late 2009.Strontium, Molybdenum, Ruthenium, Francium, Ytterbium. Neptunium, Berkelium, Californium, Lawrencium. What are you all about? How were you discovered? Why are you so important? And why the heck are you so rare? This is neat science told in a fun and effervescent way. There are some awesome, awe-inspiring, and yet sometimes pedestrian, elements out there. Science ofttimes moves forward in jumps and spurts, and Kean is quick to relate how it moves chaotically, unexpectedly, bizarrely, and accidentally. The author reviews not just core chemistry but also history, physics, cosmology, and psychology. The scientists and their Rube Goldberg experiments are as interesting as the results. Periodic elements are really cool (yes, I actually said that). They’re phenomenal, toxic, powerful, rare, ephemeral, magical, radioactive, and have the most interesting relationships to each other. We’re told why, when, and how they’ve been used and abused through history, and how they shepherded great leaps in the advancement of human civilization.The Disappearing Spoon is quick, light reading out in the sun. It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way. Kean uses good rhythm in the book, chapters of uniform length, and a bit of humor to bring it all home. He pulls it off effectively--Mr Wizard meets chaos theory. Sixth grade, mall, ‘wow’-science is discussed right next to the paragraph about how to produce absolute zero or 35 million degrees, both of which, incidentally, are created by lasers.In the end, you’ll learn a little, laugh a little. You may not remember anything from this book 2 years from now, but you will retain this: elements are neat as hell, and thank goodness for chemists and physicists. New words: depilatory, eluted"
121,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,0,"My GR friend Jason writes sturdy and trustworthy reviews, but I must take exception with him here :The Disappearing Spoon is quick, light reading out in the sun. It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way.Yes, it is all that, IF such stuff as this makes sense to you :The strongest solo acid is still the boron-based carborane (HCB11C111) And this boron acid has the best punchline so far : it's simultaneously the world's strongest and gentlest acid. To wrap your head around that, remember that acids split into positive and negative parts. In carborane's case you get H+ and an elaborate cagelike structure formed by everything else (CB11C111-) With most acids it's the negative portion that's corrosive and caustic and eats through the skin. But the boron cage forms one of the most stable molecules ever invented. Its boron atoms share electrons so generously that it practically becomes helium, and it won't go around ripping electrons from other atoms, the usual cause of acidic carnage.Well, this could be part of the rules of Quidditch for all the sense it makes to poor general reader me, so I think The Disappearing Spoon is really for science geeks who think stuff about German chemists being hornswoggled out of a Nobel Prize for Alchemy by some Californian sharpies in 1951 or a neat account of the crucial properties of the biomolecule which are called handedness is the very thing for those moments on the beach when there isn't any eye candy around."
122,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3504278-kate,4,"Okay. Let me tell it to you honestly.This book is not the most well written book - the sentences are clunky and there is not a clear narrative. It is much more of a rambling collection of stories and facts and quirky science knowledge.That said, I couldn't get back to reading this fast enough. I thought about a book about the scientific table throughout the day. I stole a few minutes wherever I could. I carried this book with me and was even *gasp* early to pick up the kids so that I could read a few minutes in the car.I mean, the opening factoid is about our ability to trace Lewis & Clark's trail by following the mercury laced poop trail. I love that shit. Growing up, I never loved science. I didn't learn the periodic table in school like others did. And so, there were times in this book, where I only understood a few clauses in each paragraph because the concepts were so advanced, but the author did a great job of bringing it back to a laypersons' comprehension in the next paragraph. So, in summary, this book is written for all levels of science (or not) nerds. It is full of incredible tales and the fun secrets and stories of the people involved in the development of the periodic table (and science as we know it).I will absolutely be rereading this book - most definitely when the boys are learning the periodic table in school."
123,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,4,"This is an absolutely brilliant idea for a book and it’s a superb book. It’s beautifully organized and well written. It’s a wonderful way to learn and/or deepen knowledge of chemistry. This book is fine for laypeople, but will give meaning and extra enjoyment even for advanced chemistry students. Much appreciated by me was that the information imparted was over my head only a very few times, and that’s saying a lot, because I’ve never taken a chemistry class.This book covers the elements of the periodic table via its history and by telling stories about the various elements: their history of discovery, how they’ve been used at various times, various people who found ways to make use of them. Anyone with a smidgen of curiosity about any aspect of life should find many things here that they find interesting. So many subjects are covered including astronomy, war, South Pole exploration, health and illness and poisoning, history, other sciences, the personalities of those who have contributed to the findings in the field, and so much more. It’s jam packed with useful facts and enjoyable stories. The relevance of the elements (chemistry) in everyday life is made so clear.There are many lovely digressions that turn out not to be digressions at all. There were very amusing parts, including funny quips that frequently pop up, and all of those quips have substance. It has a sort of gossipy (in a good way) tone. I learned so much. I found out that I love Linus Pauling and many other scientists who’ve contributed to the field. I was surprised how much of what’s been discovered in the field of chemistry has been done fairly recently, and how it’s still a growing, living scientific endeavor. While I’ve always been interested in science, and I did want a chemistry set when I was a child (request denied), I knew deplorably little about chemistry. Like the author, I loved playing with growing balls of mercury from broken thermometers. Quite a few of the elements themselves were, of course, familiar to me, but I didn’t know much about them. I had a bit of chemistry in other college science classes and in nutrition class. As I read, I frequently wished I’d memorized the table before reading this book. There is a table of the elements in the back of the book but it includes abbreviations only; it is not embellished; there is no list of elements by name next to it. However, in the index, thankfully, the elements are listed in bold, and I referred to that index at the beginning of every chapter when some elements were listed, in what looked to me like unusual Scrabble tiles. I read the notes as I read along, and they were easy to find because they started with page number and beginning of phrase in bold as a match their section in the book, but I’d still rather they’d have been included in the text proper to make the information even easier to read and to make it flow more smoothly.This book should be part of every beginning chemistry class. It makes the subject so interesting. This is certainly not the only attempt to make chemistry a great deal of fun for everyone. The book mentions the Tom Lehrer song, The Elements (which can be seen in many places including here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYW50F...).I really enjoyed this book, although I did end up reading it slowly, and I did take one break to read the young adult novel Mockingjay, which I’d been waiting to read for nearly a year.This is a gem of a book and such a great idea. I adored the humor, and there was a lot of it. I’ll let readers see for themselves why the book’s title is what it is.I hope that Sam Kean (or someone) writes similar books about physics, mathematics, etc. etc. I would definitely read them if they were as clever as this book."

To that goodreads troll I now have an answer: this book.If you had told me a few weeks ago that I'd find a book about chemistry and the periodic table of elements difficult to put down, I'd have had a hard time believing you. But I did. This book was funny, interesting, even gripping at times, and always engaging. I took off a star because I'll admit that I didn't get all of it despite the author's best efforts. I guess it would take more than a fun book to turn me into a chemistry person. But it was still a wonderful read, and not a guilty pleasure because it was actually educational. This meant I could feel virtuous for once while I ignored my various responsibilities in favor of more reading.So not only did I get to enjoy a good book, I feel vindicated in my ongoing belief that a a sufficiently good writer can make any topic interesting, even to a reluctant reader. Yes – sometimes it pays to leave your reading comfort zone. And when it doesn’t, you have every right to complain because it is about the book, not just about a personal bias with regard to the content.

126,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431873-emily,3,"This book took me 76 days, or almost three months, to read. In this case, I needed all seventy-six individual days to work my brain through passages like this one:
For instance, thirteen aluminium atoms grouped together in the right way do a killer bromine: the two entities are indistinguishable in chemical reactions. This happens despite the cluster being thirteen times larger than a single bromine atom and despite aluminium being nothing like the lacrimatory poison-gas staple ... The clusters work like this. The atoms arrange themselves into a three-dimensional polyhedron, and each atom in it mimics a proton and a neutron in a collective nucleus. The caveat is that electrons can flow around inside this soft nucleic blob, and the atoms share the electrons collectively. Scientists wryly call this state of matter ""jellium.""
All you need to know is that I'm sort of an idiot. If you read the above passage and thought, ""This makes perfect sense! What an appropriate way to explain jellium, a state I've always been interested in!"", then you are less of an idiot than me and will probably enjoy this book very much. To give more context, here's how much of an idiot I am: when I took physics at Stanford (on the way to my successful minor! ha!), I had a lot of trouble with electricity and optics. To study, I did literally every single problem from those chapters, and I did the word problems multiple times. When I got to the final, I immediately recognized one of the problems I had done at least four times, was jubilant for about 2 seconds, and then realized I had absolutely no idea how to do it. (I think I only got half credit.) That is how good I am at squashing scientific concepts into my brain. On the positive side, I find all of this very interesting, and because I forget it so quickly, I have a lifetime of renewed discoveries ahead of me."

This book is rich in empirical evidence and interesting tales of the last 200 years of history and discoveries of the chemical elements of the periodic table. However, the countless stories lacked the threads that could have given them a common fabric.The periodic table, which is currently comprised of 118 elements (112 at the time the book was written), is an ongoing process. The number of elements in our 14 billion year old universe increased over time. Right after the Big Bang a couple of elements formed, but later through nuclear fusion in stars, and stellar explosions known as supernovas, created and released the other naturally occurring elements. The remaining elements in the periodic table are synthetic (woman-made / man-made). The book walks us through Mendeleev's periodic table of elements that is composed of the main ingredients that chemists, physicists, and other scientist use for their recipes and experiments. The author shares many amusing background stories on how numerous chemical elements were isolated and shaped the way wars were fought, politics conducted, and relationships impacted.We see how women, like Marie Skłodowska Curie, her daughter Irene, Lise Meitner, and others played a pivotal role in the evolution of the periodic table.The author also recognizes that science, as a whole, was greatly contributed by immigrants.Somewhere in the first quarter of the book an interesting question was asked by Kean and that is whether theory or experiments are responsible for the advancement of science? I wish this question was further elaborated. The reader will definitely walk away with a considerable amount of interesting information, but not enough understanding of the subject matter. The author spent almost the whole book informing, rather than teaching and challenging me to think. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting a tour of the chemical elements and their backstories.[I read the Montenegrin (Serbian / Croatian / Bosnian) translation Kašika koja nestaje - autor Sem Kin.

It's not poorly written (though it ain't Solzhenitsyn) and it's not that uninteresting of a topic, but I just found that after the first 40ish pages, I dreaded having to read more. It was like pulling teeth, only a bit less painful, even without the option of novocaine.I think part of it was that the book wasn't well organized. The author seemed to jump around the periodic table at his whim without keeping a consistent framework (perhaps that was the point, it was a bit unclear to me). Anyway, the writing is OKish enough and it is certainly very well researched, so I can understand why many people have liked it. And it's really not a bad science book, but for some reason I just found myself having a viscerally negative reaction to having to read the next chapter (well I guess I didn't have to keep reading on, but whatever). I don't know, I wish I could pinpoint the source of my discontent with this, but it is what it is, so feel free to try it out for yourself."

I feel like I learned some things, which isn't that difficult of a feat since what I remember from my high school chemistry class has more to do with the people sitting near me (we called ourselves the Peanut Gallery). I have vague memories of a teacher, the great Thorstein Sabo, who tried to teach us about the periodic table by telling us stories about electrons playing cribbage in the electron hotel. I didn't really get it. This book groups different elements, and tells stories about them in context of political intrigue, devastating consequences, and lifesaving discoveries. Coincidentally, I am also reading Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age, a book with a lot of parallels to The Disappearing Spoon. Where The Disappearing Spoon demonstrates how war interrupts scientific process, Rites of Spring shows the same about war interfering in the arts. You have to wonder how much farther, or at least different, both science and the arts would be, had we never had the world wars consuming the first half of the twentieth century.The tiny pieces of information I didn't know would fill a book, this book. It would be impossible to even recite them, but I particularly enjoyed the story of argyria, silver poisoning, and the senate/governor hopeful who drank collodial silver in preparation for Y2K. Argyria turns your skin blue... permanently. Papa smurf!I also made a note to myself to check out the poet Lowell, who is one of the first people to be treated with Lithium for mental illness. Salt (not an element) was also put into perspective with Ghandi and enforced iodine and I just don't know whether to be grateful that my government is preventing birth defects or to be freaked out that they are adding things like iodine to salt and fluoride to the water. The audiobook was great for this. Sean Runnette has a unique voice that I enjoyed in zombie stories but still translated well to science!I will leave you with a song I could not get out of my head during my listen to the second half of the book."

Not because I wasn't enjoying the book: it's readable, fascinating, and chock full of the very anecdotes about science and scientists that I love. So then, why the hell did I find this book so hard?It's precisely because the book is a collection of anecdotes that it was so hard to read. I felt like I was trying to grasp quicksilver (mercury, symbol Hg from Latin hydragyrum, meaning “water silver”) as this steady diet of atomic information arrived. Actually, that's a lousy metaphor: quicksilver is a glistening hypnotic liquid because its atoms stick together. These atomic anecdotes didn't: nothing stuck in my head, nothing stuck to each other. There was no overall organizing principle to the book that I could divine, and reluctantly I finished it barely the wiser than I begun.This book demands flashcards. I want to know the anecdotes. I want them to stick. I am going to have to work at it, however, beyond simply reading the book, if that is to happen."

This was an interesting look at history as told thru the periodic table. I can't really speak to the accuracy of the science but I really enjoyed reading all the tales. I recognized a lot of the science names but learned some knew things about them. The parts I found the most interesting were how great an effect WWII had on science and scientists and the parts about mental health and brain health. I listened to the audio narrated very ably by Seaan Runnette."
133,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,3,"Drive by review both literally and figuratively. Interesting/educational book with interesting anecdotes. Assumes a level of scientific knowledge not necessarily found in a casually curious science neophyte. IOW, way over my head. Rather hard to maintain focus and interest when you are barely understanding the composition of the simplest atoms. My take aways from the book are that the Periodic Table is drawn the way that it is beyond formatting choices. There are reasons that every element is located where it is on the table. The fact that the Periodic Table is mapped the way it is, is a scientific marvel. Also, Helium is the only element on the Periodic Table that doesn't combine with any other elements to form molecules. It sees itself as perfect. That's it. My sum total take away from the book. Some rather lucky and stupid scientists travails too...3.5ish rounded down because I forgot what element the disappearing spoon was. The stories didn't stick.Listened to the audiobook. Narrated by Sean Runnette who did a respectable job with a complex and sometimes tedious subject."

The degree of anthropomorphizing of atoms in the introductory chapters has left me completely puzzled about the actual science involved. I have no idea what it means that oxygen is ""a bully."" Does oxygen shake down other atoms for electrons? How does that even work?However, the chapter on chemical warfare has been (disturbing but) interesting. If the rest of the book is historical-figures character-driven, rather than atomic character-driven, then my overall opinion of the book should improve. Ugh, spoke too soon. Most of the chapter discusses chemical warfare in Europe around the World Wars. Therefore, most of the chapter is about named individuals -- chemists and soldiers and heads of state. And then one gets to the last four pages which are about how the cell phone industry's demand for niobium and tantalum fed the war in the Congo... a war which is all tribalism and ancient grudges (unlike Europe's wars?). ""Gruesome stories have circulated about proud victors humiliating their victims' bodies by draping themselves with entrails and dancing in celebration."" Lurid detail, but with no names, no location, no citations. I wish I were kidding. Gruesome stories circulated about 'the Hun' during the war, too, but I didn't see those stories getting a whole lot of coverage in this science book and for good reason -- so why are the stories about Congolese atrocities getting uncritically repeated here? And then to just win at post-colonialism, he unironically quotes Joseph Conrad, who ""once called Congo, 'the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human consceince,' and there's little reason to revise that notion today."" Thank you ever so much for perpetuating the stereotypical images of the Dark Continent, images which don't need revising despite being a hundred years out of date."
136,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,Okay I will start by saying this is a fascinating book but you will need some understanding of the periodic table and chemistry - now I am not saying you need to be degree level but it will make some of the references a little easier to spot and the importance of some of the statements just that little more dramatic. That said and I have read a number of chemistry books both for fun and for academic reasons (yes okay I am chemist) but I did like how the author approached the subject of each chapter. I will admit that it did sort of follow a formula in that he would explain the focus of the chapter (which element or family of elements) a long with hints of entertaining stories and anecdotes. He would then go back to these stories and explain them further - with the idea that he would reinforce the message of each chapter. So I guess you would have the technical scholarly part followed by the humorous and entertaining story. For me I thought this was a great way of bringing the message home without either being boring or overbearing. This is a great book for those interested in chemistry. Yes by the nature of the book it focuses on the elements and little of their compounds (although it does talk about their chemistries) but its a great launch pad in to further studies 
137,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This book is quite an entertaining read. It is packed with interesting anecdotes about scientists who explored the outer fringes of the periodic table. I even learned a little bit of chemistry. The book is organized in an intelligent manner--each chapter is devoted to some theme, with a small group of elements that fit into that theme in some way. Sometimes the author strays from the exploration of elements, but he always seems to relate to the chapter's theme. The only thing that puts me off a bit, is the author's style. It is a rather folksy style, where the words ""um"", ""well"", and ""friggin"" can be found in the middle of a sentence."
138,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"In a breezy style, Kean intersperses chemistry and physics with a potpourri of stories revolving around the elements. He explains how the elements formed and how they were discovered. He blends complex science and human interest in his examples of how the elements have been used and influenced history. Kean transitions quickly from deep discussions of atomic structure or quantum mechanics to oddities such as the nutcase who turned blue eating silver because he thought there would be no antibiotics after Y2K. Kean tries to make difficult concepts comprehensible such as the fine structure constant and why it is so fundamental to our understanding of the universe. He also fills his book with obscure facts such as how many ounces of the element astatine there are on the earth. The answer is one. And if you find it, it will be gone before you can do anything with it. Kean serves up tidbits of the lives of the scientists including their personal and professional quirks and claims to fame. He focuses on the developers of the periodic table from Mendeleev who is credited with the original to Glenn Seaborg whose discoveries of super heavy elements expanded it. We learn about Linus Pauling’s unraveling of the structure of protein and his misguided attempt to be the first to crack the structure of DNA. Crick and Watson cagily won that race. He discusses the discovery of quantum mechanics from Max Planck’s initial findings about the spectral distribution of black body radiation to Einstein’s concept of energy as a particle and on through Bohr, Heisenberg and others. These are just a few of the brief vignettes of famous scientists in Kean’s book. The Disappearing Spoon is full of good stuff for those who want their science lightened up by entertaining sidebars. It’s a bit of a teaser. Kean gives you just enough to get interested in a topic. So I found myself frequently going on line or considering getting something more in depth. The book’s diversity makes it a great way to find something new you might want to know more about. It’s also the perfect book for readers with short attention spans."
139,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"This book was lots of fun, and it certainly taught me more than I ever learned in high school chemistry class. Quite honestly, if someone had asked me for a definition of ""chemistry"" before, I don't think I would have known what to say. At the same time, The Disappearing Spoon wasn't like a lecture in the least bit, and instead folded tons of scientific information into stories about the scientists and their accomplishments. I'd recommend it to anyone who's curious about a subject they may have only encountered at the 101 level."
140,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3548626-ian-tregillis,4,"This is a rare specimen among the books I tend to read: a two-bookmark book. I was skeptical when this first came to my attention. I grew up reading any and every science-related book I could find. My early fascination with books about science -- particularly chemistry and physics -- led, many years later, to my day job career. (I also blame Dr. Who for this, but that's a longer story.) But it was a long road, and not surprisingly along the way I lost my enthusiasm for reading books about science topics in my spare time. I always have, and always will, love the fact that people are writing and reading them. But somewhere, along the way to becoming an adult, the stuff I used to love as a kid started to feel like... homework. Like taking my work home with me.I thought a book filled with strange anecdotes related to the Periodic Table sounded like a terrific idea for folks that would be interested in such things. But that I would not be one of those people. This, in spite of the fact that when I was much younger (before I finally got to learn about all the stuff I wanted to learn) I used to spend hours staring at the Periodic Table, studying it, trying and failing to unpack its arcane secrets. (And yet somehow I'd completely forgotten about that until I read this book. This book deserves four stars just on the basis of helping me remember this.) Eventually I learned about the mathematics of atoms, and how this gives rise to the Periodic Table. And it was glorious. But then I grew up. Life as an adult is heavy on the mortgage payments, lighter on the soul-stirring wonderment.So, yeah. I figured I didn't need to read a book about the table because I already knew how it worked. It's still true I didn't need to read this book, but the 10-year-old inside me sure did. I'm glad I listened to him.Sam Kean (who, judging from his photo on the rear flap, could be a friend's lost twin) adopts a casual, easygoing tone, which keeps the book easily readable, even when the subject matter might become dry in less capable hands. He touches on the scientific underpinnings of the subject when necessary yet never gets bogged down in the weeds. And though he glosses over the details in places (as is the only right thing to do in a book like this) his explanations make for clear, concise distillations of the subject matter. Never did I find myself tempted to skim, even when I was familiar with the background details. I'd heard a few of the stories in this book, but only a few, and those I'd either misremembered or learned incorrectly in the first place. Much of the information in this book was new to me, but all of it was fascinating. This is much more than a book about the elements and the table upon which they reside; it's also a book about the people who discovered them, loved them, hated them, yearned for them, tried to recreate them. As such, it's filled with remarkable and fascinating tidbits. I didn't know that exposure to tellurium can make a person reek like garlic. I didn't know that beryllium tastes like sugar. (Where I work, the eating of beryllium is discouraged.) I didn't know about the World War I fight over a nearly defunct mine in Colorado. I didn't know that Fritz Haber was such an epic tool. I didn't know that the ""S"" of the BCS theory of superconductivity went to prison.Much of the most fascinating and entertaining material is tucked away in extensive footnotes. The footnote section is worth reading just on its own. The author clearly couldn't resist including many of the little tidbits he'd learned in the course of his research. But rather than breaking the logical development of each section with a tangential anecdote, he leaves the digressions to the footnote section. This section is worth reading just on its own. The notes appear so frequently that I needed two bookmarks, so that I could flip back and forth between the body text and the footnotes section. If you do decide to pick this up, absolutely do not skip the footnotes. Some of the best stuff is in there. Much of it isn't strictly related to the periodic table, but it's golden just the same.The book is organized logically, following the first attempts to classify the elements through to cutting-edge speculations about the ""island of stability"", quantum dots, and other current topics. Each chapter is organized around a theme -- Elements in Times of War, Elements as Money, The Elements of Madness, Poisoner's Corner, etc. The narrative thread of each chapter weaves its way through multiple boxes on the periodic table. (In a lovely piece of book design, the periodic table entries for the relevant elements appear at the top of each chapter.) Kean does an enviable job of developing each chapter logically, and deserves much credit for finding such clean paths through what could have become thickets. In a few places, the narrative's relationship to the chapter theme felt a little forced. But the information along the way is so fun, and presented so well, that I never cared. "
141,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063661-woodge,4,"This book was an interesting compendium of stories linking up the various elements of the Periodic Table. Not only did I learn about the various scientists who discovered this or that element, but I learned a good deal about many of the elements themselves. It was entertaining enough that I kept coming back to it to read more. I've got a much better understanding now of elements and what makes them differ from each other. And I didn't even realize that elements can change (or decay) into other elements. Never really thought about it, I guess. Now I know how it can happen (though not every element does this.) Lots of cool facts and odd stories about odd scientists are embedded in this book. Recommended for anyone interested in science, especially those without a Ph.D. It's rocks for jocks. "

It makes chemistry and physics comprehensible and fun. I listened to it in audio and thought the narrator did a fantastic job with it. He actually made the jokes sound funny. He knew what tone the author was striving for and he hit it spot-on. However, I think I ended up missing a lot by listening rather than reading. The book is so packed full of fun facts and numbers and, of course, references to the periodic table. I'm sure there were charts and diagrams I just didn't get in an audiobook.

The Periodic Table! Chemistry! How could I possibly be completely enthralled by such a book? How could I dare give it five stars when I wasn't able to truly understand a lot of what I read?Because of the writing, pure and simple.Kean makes chemistry accessible for the willing-to-make-an-intellectual-effort layperson - but it's not just the chemistry. It's the characters BEHIND the chemistry, the stories of their discoveries and the things they overlooked. It's about the politics and the culture and the drama of the creation of that little set of boxes that we're all so familiar with.I was fascinated.I have found myself sharing little anecdotes with my (yes, young) children and my friends. I pulled out the book at dinner tonight and had to tell the story of that ""disappearing spoon"" to everyone at the table. I loved the history, both in our modern world and the earth itself. It feels like this knowledge is so essential to human life, that these things he is talking about are, literally, at the root of what we're all made of and Kean is just able to share that information in an interesting and not-your-stuffy-old-professor style.Yes, there is a lot of science in there, but don't be scared though. You can still get so much out of the stories if you're willing to let yourself gloss over the really deep stuff and just glean as much out of it as you can. I'm going to return my copy to the library and then buy my own, so I can read parts of it again. I liked it that much. "
148,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5310185-qoh,3,"This book takes a monumental topic -- the periodic table -- and breaks it down into various digestible topic areas. While I enjoyed it (and learned a lot of history of science trivia I'd been unaware of, what with my head stuck in the 18th century) and had a few ""a-ha"" moments as some organic chemistry concepts FINALLY made sense to me (14 years after my last ochem class), I have two big problems with the book. -1 star because the book needed editing. Badly. Kean's writing is usually OK, but sometimes forced, folksy, and pedantic. I could go from enjoyment to annoyance to wanting to throw it across the room and/or get out my red pen. -1 star because there is no comprehensive bibliography, which is a cardinal sin in a book about science, just a short list of books. I have no doubt he did a lot of research, but there should be *some* accountability. Instead, in endnotes, there are more folksy stories (that require flipping to the back of the book to read, and which were usually only tangential and not particularly interesting footnotes to the main story, meaning the flow was disrupted for no good reason). In any case: interesting topic, good stories, only OK execution, and little authorial accountability. I really can't see myself reading anything Kean writes in the future unless he cites his sources and drops the folksy facade. "
149,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"The Disappearing Spoon is not quite as entertaining to me as Sam Kean’s book on neuroscience, but it’s still reasonably fun and definitely an easy read. There’s all kinds of random facts, and he makes things like electron shells very clear — even for me, with my brain’s stubborn refusal to grasp it all. He writes with humour and enthusiasm, pulling out interesting characters and discoveries from the history of the Periodic Table and its elements.I’m just not as into chemistry/physics as I am biology. Even organic chemistry. I should be, but, alas. So I found that this dragged a bit — for me.

150,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,4,"Stop the search. Recall the teams. I have found the non-fiction, summer read of 2010! The Disappearing Spoon.First, what’s a summer read, Mr. Josey Wales thumbnail photo? A summer read is one you can enjoy during a vacation to the beach, with fresh cocktails and clean towels provided by the swarthy, bronzed attendant at a seafront hotel. You can finish it in a few days in bite-sized chunks, it doesn’t overpower you academically, you learn a little, and the subject is something entirely new to you, which allows you to ‘escape’ mentally just as you are physically from that 50-hour, weekly cubicle career and hateful commuter traffic.The book catalogues the 200 year history of the piecemeal development of the periodic table in chemistry. Wait, this is not your high school chemistry class! Sam Kean uses the most idiosyncratic, unusual, serendipitous, and funny events to tell this story. You learn as much about the brilliant, boisterous, bi-polar, bastardly, and braggadocio scientists as you learn about each element on the periodic table. Each of 19 chapters pulls together several periodic elements and outlines their unexpected similarity and relatedness--atomically, quantumly and culturally. And the narrative moves fluidly back and forth through time to capture the relevant history of each element. The book highlights discoveries that are still being made, current as of late 2009.Strontium, Molybdenum, Ruthenium, Francium, Ytterbium. Neptunium, Berkelium, Californium, Lawrencium. What are you all about? How were you discovered? Why are you so important? And why the heck are you so rare? This is neat science told in a fun and effervescent way. There are some awesome, awe-inspiring, and yet sometimes pedestrian, elements out there. Science ofttimes moves forward in jumps and spurts, and Kean is quick to relate how it moves chaotically, unexpectedly, bizarrely, and accidentally. The author reviews not just core chemistry but also history, physics, cosmology, and psychology. The scientists and their Rube Goldberg experiments are as interesting as the results. Periodic elements are really cool (yes, I actually said that). They’re phenomenal, toxic, powerful, rare, ephemeral, magical, radioactive, and have the most interesting relationships to each other. We’re told why, when, and how they’ve been used and abused through history, and how they shepherded great leaps in the advancement of human civilization.The Disappearing Spoon is quick, light reading out in the sun. It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way. Kean uses good rhythm in the book, chapters of uniform length, and a bit of humor to bring it all home. He pulls it off effectively--Mr Wizard meets chaos theory. Sixth grade, mall, ‘wow’-science is discussed right next to the paragraph about how to produce absolute zero or 35 million degrees, both of which, incidentally, are created by lasers.In the end, you’ll learn a little, laugh a little. You may not remember anything from this book 2 years from now, but you will retain this: elements are neat as hell, and thank goodness for chemists and physicists. New words: depilatory, eluted"

It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way.Yes, it is all that, IF such stuff as this makes sense to you :The strongest solo acid is still the boron-based carborane (HCB11C111) And this boron acid has the best punchline so far : it's simultaneously the world's strongest and gentlest acid. To wrap your head around that, remember that acids split into positive and negative parts. In carborane's case you get H+ and an elaborate cagelike structure formed by everything else (CB11C111-) With most acids it's the negative portion that's corrosive and caustic and eats through the skin. But the boron cage forms one of the most stable molecules ever invented. Its boron atoms share electrons so generously that it practically becomes helium, and it won't go around ripping electrons from other atoms, the usual cause of acidic carnage.Well, this could be part of the rules of Quidditch for all the sense it makes to poor general reader me, so I think The Disappearing Spoon is really for science geeks who think stuff about German chemists being hornswoggled out of a Nobel Prize for Alchemy by some Californian sharpies in 1951 or a neat account of the crucial properties of the biomolecule which are called handedness is the very thing for those moments on the beach when there isn't any eye candy around."
152,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3504278-kate,4,"Okay. Let me tell it to you honestly.This book is not the most well written book - the sentences are clunky and there is not a clear narrative. It is much more of a rambling collection of stories and facts and quirky science knowledge.That said, I couldn't get back to reading this fast enough. I thought about a book about the scientific table throughout the day. I stole a few minutes wherever I could. I carried this book with me and was even *gasp* early to pick up the kids so that I could read a few minutes in the car.I mean, the opening factoid is about our ability to trace Lewis & Clark's trail by following the mercury laced poop trail. I love that shit. Growing up, I never loved science. I didn't learn the periodic table in school like others did. And so, there were times in this book, where I only understood a few clauses in each paragraph because the concepts were so advanced, but the author did a great job of bringing it back to a laypersons' comprehension in the next paragraph. So, in summary, this book is written for all levels of science (or not) nerds. It is full of incredible tales and the fun secrets and stories of the people involved in the development of the periodic table (and science as we know it).I will absolutely be rereading this book - most definitely when the boys are learning the periodic table in school."
153,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,4,"This is an absolutely brilliant idea for a book and it’s a superb book. It’s beautifully organized and well written. It’s a wonderful way to learn and/or deepen knowledge of chemistry. This book is fine for laypeople, but will give meaning and extra enjoyment even for advanced chemistry students. Much appreciated by me was that the information imparted was over my head only a very few times, and that’s saying a lot, because I’ve never taken a chemistry class.This book covers the elements of the periodic table via its history and by telling stories about the various elements: their history of discovery, how they’ve been used at various times, various people who found ways to make use of them. Anyone with a smidgen of curiosity about any aspect of life should find many things here that they find interesting. So many subjects are covered including astronomy, war, South Pole exploration, health and illness and poisoning, history, other sciences, the personalities of those who have contributed to the findings in the field, and so much more. It’s jam packed with useful facts and enjoyable stories. The relevance of the elements (chemistry) in everyday life is made so clear.There are many lovely digressions that turn out not to be digressions at all. There were very amusing parts, including funny quips that frequently pop up, and all of those quips have substance. It has a sort of gossipy (in a good way) tone. I learned so much. I found out that I love Linus Pauling and many other scientists who’ve contributed to the field. I was surprised how much of what’s been discovered in the field of chemistry has been done fairly recently, and how it’s still a growing, living scientific endeavor. While I’ve always been interested in science, and I did want a chemistry set when I was a child (request denied), I knew deplorably little about chemistry. Like the author, I loved playing with growing balls of mercury from broken thermometers. Quite a few of the elements themselves were, of course, familiar to me, but I didn’t know much about them. I had a bit of chemistry in other college science classes and in nutrition class. As I read, I frequently wished I’d memorized the table before reading this book. There is a table of the elements in the back of the book but it includes abbreviations only; it is not embellished; there is no list of elements by name next to it. However, in the index, thankfully, the elements are listed in bold, and I referred to that index at the beginning of every chapter when some elements were listed, in what looked to me like unusual Scrabble tiles. I read the notes as I read along, and they were easy to find because they started with page number and beginning of phrase in bold as a match their section in the book, but I’d still rather they’d have been included in the text proper to make the information even easier to read and to make it flow more smoothly.This book should be part of every beginning chemistry class. It makes the subject so interesting. This is certainly not the only attempt to make chemistry a great deal of fun for everyone. The book mentions the Tom Lehrer song, The Elements (which can be seen in many places including here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYW50F...).I really enjoyed this book, although I did end up reading it slowly, and I did take one break to read the young adult novel Mockingjay, which I’d been waiting to read for nearly a year.This is a gem of a book and such a great idea. I adored the humor, and there was a lot of it. I’ll let readers see for themselves why the book’s title is what it is.I hope that Sam Kean (or someone) writes similar books about physics, mathematics, etc. etc. I would definitely read them if they were as clever as this book."

What a lot of baloney! The Disappearing Spoon is, quite literally, one of the most fascinating, informative, FUNNY, books about the Periodic Table that I've ever read. Okay, it is the only book about the Periodic Table that I've ever read - but it is amazing. For those who love science or for those who simply would like to better under the elements that make the cosmos what it is, then this is a must read for you!!

To that goodreads troll I now have an answer: this book.If you had told me a few weeks ago that I'd find a book about chemistry and the periodic table of elements difficult to put down, I'd have had a hard time believing you. But I did. This book was funny, interesting, even gripping at times, and always engaging. I took off a star because I'll admit that I didn't get all of it despite the author's best efforts. I guess it would take more than a fun book to turn me into a chemistry person. But it was still a wonderful read, and not a guilty pleasure because it was actually educational. This meant I could feel virtuous for once while I ignored my various responsibilities in favor of more reading.So not only did I get to enjoy a good book, I feel vindicated in my ongoing belief that a a sufficiently good writer can make any topic interesting, even to a reluctant reader. Yes – sometimes it pays to leave your reading comfort zone. And when it doesn’t, you have every right to complain because it is about the book, not just about a personal bias with regard to the content. For a good book, there should be no such thing as a “right” or “wrong” reader."
156,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431873-emily,3,"This book took me 76 days, or almost three months, to read. In this case, I needed all seventy-six individual days to work my brain through passages like this one:
For instance, thirteen aluminium atoms grouped together in the right way do a killer bromine: the two entities are indistinguishable in chemical reactions. This happens despite the cluster being thirteen times larger than a single bromine atom and despite aluminium being nothing like the lacrimatory poison-gas staple ... The clusters work like this. The atoms arrange themselves into a three-dimensional polyhedron, and each atom in it mimics a proton and a neutron in a collective nucleus. The caveat is that electrons can flow around inside this soft nucleic blob, and the atoms share the electrons collectively. Scientists wryly call this state of matter ""jellium.""
All you need to know is that I'm sort of an idiot. If you read the above passage and thought, ""This makes perfect sense! What an appropriate way to explain jellium, a state I've always been interested in!"", then you are less of an idiot than me and will probably enjoy this book very much. To give more context, here's how much of an idiot I am: when I took physics at Stanford (on the way to my successful minor! ha!), I had a lot of trouble with electricity and optics. To study, I did literally every single problem from those chapters, and I did the word problems multiple times. When I got to the final, I immediately recognized one of the problems I had done at least four times, was jubilant for about 2 seconds, and then realized I had absolutely no idea how to do it. (I think I only got half credit.) That is how good I am at squashing scientific concepts into my brain. On the positive side, I find all of this very interesting, and because I forget it so quickly, I have a lifetime of renewed discoveries ahead of me."

I was fascinated by the many details about the hunt for elements, the private lives of the Curies, the radioactive boy scout, the dangers of storing rare elements in the Congo, and that the same man who invented nitrogen rich fertilizers, is also the inventor of zyklon B. It also made me want to read more about The Manhattan Project, so I guess its time to put the Rhodes book on my wishlist."

This book is rich in empirical evidence and interesting tales of the last 200 years of history and discoveries of the chemical elements of the periodic table. However, the countless stories lacked the threads that could have given them a common fabric.The periodic table, which is currently comprised of 118 elements (112 at the time the book was written), is an ongoing process. The number of elements in our 14 billion year old universe increased over time. Right after the Big Bang a couple of elements formed, but later through nuclear fusion in stars, and stellar explosions known as supernovas, created and released the other naturally occurring elements. The remaining elements in the periodic table are synthetic (woman-made / man-made). The book walks us through Mendeleev's periodic table of elements that is composed of the main ingredients that chemists, physicists, and other scientist use for their recipes and experiments. The author shares many amusing background stories on how numerous chemical elements were isolated and shaped the way wars were fought, politics conducted, and relationships impacted.We see how women, like Marie Skłodowska Curie, her daughter Irene, Lise Meitner, and others played a pivotal role in the evolution of the periodic table.The author also recognizes that science, as a whole, was greatly contributed by immigrants.Somewhere in the first quarter of the book an interesting question was asked by Kean and that is whether theory or experiments are responsible for the advancement of science? I wish this question was further elaborated. The reader will definitely walk away with a considerable amount of interesting information, but not enough understanding of the subject matter. The author spent almost the whole book informing, rather than teaching and challenging me to think. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting a tour of the chemical elements and their backstories.[I read the Montenegrin (Serbian / Croatian / Bosnian) translation Kašika koja nestaje - autor Sem Kin. Laguna 2018 Publishing / 459 pages / 111,901 words. Great translation.]"

It's not poorly written (though it ain't Solzhenitsyn) and it's not that uninteresting of a topic, but I just found that after the first 40ish pages, I dreaded having to read more. It was like pulling teeth, only a bit less painful, even without the option of novocaine.I think part of it was that the book wasn't well organized. The author seemed to jump around the periodic table at his whim without keeping a consistent framework (perhaps that was the point, it was a bit unclear to me). Anyway, the writing is OKish enough and it is certainly very well researched, so I can understand why many people have liked it. And it's really not a bad science book, but for some reason I just found myself having a viscerally negative reaction to having to read the next chapter (well I guess I didn't have to keep reading on, but whatever). I don't know, I wish I could pinpoint the source of my discontent with this, but it is what it is, so feel free to try it out for yourself."

I feel like I learned some things, which isn't that difficult of a feat since what I remember from my high school chemistry class has more to do with the people sitting near me (we called ourselves the Peanut Gallery). I have vague memories of a teacher, the great Thorstein Sabo, who tried to teach us about the periodic table by telling us stories about electrons playing cribbage in the electron hotel. I didn't really get it. This book groups different elements, and tells stories about them in context of political intrigue, devastating consequences, and lifesaving discoveries. Coincidentally, I am also reading Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age, a book with a lot of parallels to The Disappearing Spoon. Where The Disappearing Spoon demonstrates how war interrupts scientific process, Rites of Spring shows the same about war interfering in the arts. You have to wonder how much farther, or at least different, both science and the arts would be, had we never had the world wars consuming the first half of the twentieth century.The tiny pieces of information I didn't know would fill a book, this book. It would be impossible to even recite them, but I particularly enjoyed the story of argyria, silver poisoning, and the senate/governor hopeful who drank collodial silver in preparation for Y2K. Argyria turns your skin blue... permanently. Papa smurf!I also made a note to myself to check out the poet Lowell, who is one of the first people to be treated with Lithium for mental illness. Salt (not an element) was also put into perspective with Ghandi and enforced iodine and I just don't know whether to be grateful that my government is preventing birth defects or to be freaked out that they are adding things like iodine to salt and fluoride to the water. The audiobook was great for this. Sean Runnette has a unique voice that I enjoyed in zombie stories but still translated well to science!I will leave you with a song I could not get out of my head during my listen to the second half of the book."
161,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,3,"This book constipated my reading for almost a month. I have overdue fines from other books that were stacked up behind it. Not because I wasn't enjoying the book: it's readable, fascinating, and chock full of the very anecdotes about science and scientists that I love. So then, why the hell did I find this book so hard?It's precisely because the book is a collection of anecdotes that it was so hard to read. I felt like I was trying to grasp quicksilver (mercury, symbol Hg from Latin hydragyrum, meaning “water silver”) as this steady diet of atomic information arrived. Actually, that's a lousy metaphor: quicksilver is a glistening hypnotic liquid because its atoms stick together. These atomic anecdotes didn't: nothing stuck in my head, nothing stuck to each other. There was no overall organizing principle to the book that I could divine, and reluctantly I finished it barely the wiser than I begun.This book demands flashcards. I want to know the anecdotes. I want them to stick. I am going to have to work at it, however, beyond simply reading the book, if that is to happen."

I recognized a lot of the science names but learned some knew things about them.

Assumes a level of scientific knowledge not necessarily found in a casually curious science neophyte. IOW, way over my head. Rather hard to maintain focus and interest when you are barely understanding the composition of the simplest atoms. My take aways from the book are that the Periodic Table is drawn the way that it is beyond formatting choices. There are reasons that every element is located where it is on the table. The fact that the Periodic Table is mapped the way it is, is a scientific marvel. Also, Helium is the only element on the Periodic Table that doesn't combine with any other elements to form molecules. It sees itself as perfect. That's it. My sum total take away from the book. Some rather lucky and stupid scientists travails too...3.5ish rounded down because I forgot what element the disappearing spoon was. The stories didn't stick.Listened to the audiobook.

165,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/127002-ginger-k,2,"So far, not so great. The degree of anthropomorphizing of atoms in the introductory chapters has left me completely puzzled about the actual science involved. I have no idea what it means that oxygen is ""a bully."" Does oxygen shake down other atoms for electrons? How does that even work?However, the chapter on chemical warfare has been (disturbing but) interesting. If the rest of the book is historical-figures character-driven, rather than atomic character-driven, then my overall opinion of the book should improve. Ugh, spoke too soon. Most of the chapter discusses chemical warfare in Europe around the World Wars. Therefore, most of the chapter is about named individuals -- chemists and soldiers and heads of state. And then one gets to the last four pages which are about how the cell phone industry's demand for niobium and tantalum fed the war in the Congo... a war which is all tribalism and ancient grudges (unlike Europe's wars?). ""Gruesome stories have circulated about proud victors humiliating their victims' bodies by draping themselves with entrails and dancing in celebration."" Lurid detail, but with no names, no location, no citations. I wish I were kidding. Gruesome stories circulated about 'the Hun' during the war, too, but I didn't see those stories getting a whole lot of coverage in this science book and for good reason -- so why are the stories about Congolese atrocities getting uncritically repeated here? And then to just win at post-colonialism, he unironically quotes Joseph Conrad, who ""once called Congo, 'the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human consceince,' and there's little reason to revise that notion today."" Thank you ever so much for perpetuating the stereotypical images of the Dark Continent, images which don't need revising despite being a hundred years out of date."
166,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,Okay I will start by saying this is a fascinating book but you will need some understanding of the periodic table and chemistry - now I am not saying you need to be degree level but it will make some of the references a little easier to spot and the importance of some of the statements just that little more dramatic. That said and I have read a number of chemistry books both for fun and for academic reasons (yes okay I am chemist) but I did like how the author approached the subject of each chapter. I will admit that it did sort of follow a formula in that he would explain the focus of the chapter (which element or family of elements) a long with hints of entertaining stories and anecdotes. He would then go back to these stories and explain them further - with the idea that he would reinforce the message of each chapter. So I guess you would have the technical scholarly part followed by the humorous and entertaining story. For me I thought this was a great way of bringing the message home without either being boring or overbearing. This is a great book for those interested in chemistry. Yes by the nature of the book it focuses on the elements and little of their compounds (although it does talk about their chemistries) but its a great launch pad in to further studies 
167,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This book is quite an entertaining read. It is packed with interesting anecdotes about scientists who explored the outer fringes of the periodic table. I even learned a little bit of chemistry. The book is organized in an intelligent manner--each chapter is devoted to some theme, with a small group of elements that fit into that theme in some way. Sometimes the author strays from the exploration of elements, but he always seems to relate to the chapter's theme. The only thing that puts me off a bit, is the author's style. It is a rather folksy style, where the words ""um"", ""well"", and ""friggin"" can be found in the middle of a sentence."
168,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"In a breezy style, Kean intersperses chemistry and physics with a potpourri of stories revolving around the elements. He explains how the elements formed and how they were discovered. He blends complex science and human interest in his examples of how the elements have been used and influenced history. Kean transitions quickly from deep discussions of atomic structure or quantum mechanics to oddities such as the nutcase who turned blue eating silver because he thought there would be no antibiotics after Y2K. Kean tries to make difficult concepts comprehensible such as the fine structure constant and why it is so fundamental to our understanding of the universe. He also fills his book with obscure facts such as how many ounces of the element astatine there are on the earth. The answer is one. And if you find it, it will be gone before you can do anything with it. Kean serves up tidbits of the lives of the scientists including their personal and professional quirks and claims to fame. He focuses on the developers of the periodic table from Mendeleev who is credited with the original to Glenn Seaborg whose discoveries of super heavy elements expanded it. We learn about Linus Pauling’s unraveling of the structure of protein and his misguided attempt to be the first to crack the structure of DNA. Crick and Watson cagily won that race. He discusses the discovery of quantum mechanics from Max Planck’s initial findings about the spectral distribution of black body radiation to Einstein’s concept of energy as a particle and on through Bohr, Heisenberg and others. These are just a few of the brief vignettes of famous scientists in Kean’s book. The Disappearing Spoon is full of good stuff for those who want their science lightened up by entertaining sidebars. It’s a bit of a teaser. Kean gives you just enough to get interested in a topic. So I found myself frequently going on line or considering getting something more in depth. The book’s diversity makes it a great way to find something new you might want to know more about. It’s also the perfect book for readers with short attention spans."
169,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"This book was lots of fun, and it certainly taught me more than I ever learned in high school chemistry class. Quite honestly, if someone had asked me for a definition of ""chemistry"" before, I don't think I would have known what to say. At the same time, The Disappearing Spoon wasn't like a lecture in the least bit, and instead folded tons of scientific information into stories about the scientists and their accomplishments. I'd recommend it to anyone who's curious about a subject they may have only encountered at the 101 level."
170,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3548626-ian-tregillis,4,"This is a rare specimen among the books I tend to read: a two-bookmark book. I was skeptical when this first came to my attention. I grew up reading any and every science-related book I could find. My early fascination with books about science -- particularly chemistry and physics -- led, many years later, to my day job career. (I also blame Dr. Who for this, but that's a longer story.) But it was a long road, and not surprisingly along the way I lost my enthusiasm for reading books about science topics in my spare time. I always have, and always will, love the fact that people are writing and reading them. But somewhere, along the way to becoming an adult, the stuff I used to love as a kid started to feel like... homework. Like taking my work home with me.I thought a book filled with strange anecdotes related to the Periodic Table sounded like a terrific idea for folks that would be interested in such things. But that I would not be one of those people. This, in spite of the fact that when I was much younger (before I finally got to learn about all the stuff I wanted to learn) I used to spend hours staring at the Periodic Table, studying it, trying and failing to unpack its arcane secrets. (And yet somehow I'd completely forgotten about that until I read this book. This book deserves four stars just on the basis of helping me remember this.) Eventually I learned about the mathematics of atoms, and how this gives rise to the Periodic Table. And it was glorious. But then I grew up. Life as an adult is heavy on the mortgage payments, lighter on the soul-stirring wonderment.So, yeah. I figured I didn't need to read a book about the table because I already knew how it worked. It's still true I didn't need to read this book, but the 10-year-old inside me sure did. I'm glad I listened to him.Sam Kean (who, judging from his photo on the rear flap, could be a friend's lost twin) adopts a casual, easygoing tone, which keeps the book easily readable, even when the subject matter might become dry in less capable hands. He touches on the scientific underpinnings of the subject when necessary yet never gets bogged down in the weeds. And though he glosses over the details in places (as is the only right thing to do in a book like this) his explanations make for clear, concise distillations of the subject matter. Never did I find myself tempted to skim, even when I was familiar with the background details. I'd heard a few of the stories in this book, but only a few, and those I'd either misremembered or learned incorrectly in the first place. Much of the information in this book was new to me, but all of it was fascinating. This is much more than a book about the elements and the table upon which they reside; it's also a book about the people who discovered them, loved them, hated them, yearned for them, tried to recreate them. As such, it's filled with remarkable and fascinating tidbits. I didn't know that exposure to tellurium can make a person reek like garlic. I didn't know that beryllium tastes like sugar. (Where I work, the eating of beryllium is discouraged.) I didn't know about the World War I fight over a nearly defunct mine in Colorado. I didn't know that Fritz Haber was such an epic tool. I didn't know that the ""S"" of the BCS theory of superconductivity went to prison.Much of the most fascinating and entertaining material is tucked away in extensive footnotes. The footnote section is worth reading just on its own. The author clearly couldn't resist including many of the little tidbits he'd learned in the course of his research. But rather than breaking the logical development of each section with a tangential anecdote, he leaves the digressions to the footnote section. This section is worth reading just on its own. The notes appear so frequently that I needed two bookmarks, so that I could flip back and forth between the body text and the footnotes section. If you do decide to pick this up, absolutely do not skip the footnotes. Some of the best stuff is in there. Much of it isn't strictly related to the periodic table, but it's golden just the same.The book is organized logically, following the first attempts to classify the elements through to cutting-edge speculations about the ""island of stability"", quantum dots, and other current topics. Each chapter is organized around a theme -- Elements in Times of War, Elements as Money, The Elements of Madness, Poisoner's Corner, etc. The narrative thread of each chapter weaves its way through multiple boxes on the periodic table. (In a lovely piece of book design, the periodic table entries for the relevant elements appear at the top of each chapter.) Kean does an enviable job of developing each chapter logically, and deserves much credit for finding such clean paths through what could have become thickets. In a few places, the narrative's relationship to the chapter theme felt a little forced. But the information along the way is so fun, and presented so well, that I never cared. "
171,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063661-woodge,4,"This book was an interesting compendium of stories linking up the various elements of the Periodic Table. Not only did I learn about the various scientists who discovered this or that element, but I learned a good deal about many of the elements themselves. It was entertaining enough that I kept coming back to it to read more. I've got a much better understanding now of elements and what makes them differ from each other. And I didn't even realize that elements can change (or decay) into other elements. Never really thought about it, I guess. Now I know how it can happen (though not every element does this.) Lots of cool facts and odd stories about odd scientists are embedded in this book. Recommended for anyone interested in science, especially those without a Ph.D. It's rocks for jocks. "

He knew what tone the author was striving for and he hit it spot-on. However, I think I ended up missing a lot by listening rather than reading. The book is so packed full of fun facts and numbers and, of course, references to the periodic table. I'm sure there were charts and diagrams I just didn't get in an audiobook.

How could I dare give it five stars when I wasn't able to truly understand a lot of what I read?Because of the writing, pure and simple.Kean makes chemistry accessible for the willing-to-make-an-intellectual-effort layperson - but it's not just the chemistry. It's the characters BEHIND the chemistry, the stories of their discoveries and the things they overlooked. It's about the politics and the culture and the drama of the creation of that little set of boxes that we're all so familiar with.I was fascinated.I have found myself sharing little anecdotes with my (yes, young) children and my friends.

It feels like this knowledge is so essential to human life, that these things he is talking about are, literally, at the root of what we're all made of and Kean is just able to share that information in an interesting and not-your-stuffy-old-professor style.Yes, there is a lot of science in there, but don't be scared though. You can still get so much out of the stories if you're willing to let yourself gloss over the really deep stuff and just glean as much out of it as you can.

Badly. Kean's writing is usually OK, but sometimes forced, folksy, and pedantic. I could go from enjoyment to annoyance to wanting to throw it across the room and/or get out my red pen. -1 star because there is no comprehensive bibliography, which is a cardinal sin in a book about science, just a short list of books. I have no doubt he did a lot of research, but there should be *some* accountability. Instead, in endnotes, there are more folksy stories (that require flipping to the back of the book to read, and which were usually only tangential and not particularly interesting footnotes to the main story, meaning the flow was disrupted for no good reason). In any case: interesting topic, good stories, only OK execution, and little authorial accountability. I really can't see myself reading anything Kean writes in the future unless he cites his sources and drops the folksy facade. "
179,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"The Disappearing Spoon is not quite as entertaining to me as Sam Kean’s book on neuroscience, but it’s still reasonably fun and definitely an easy read. There’s all kinds of random facts, and he makes things like electron shells very clear — even for me, with my brain’s stubborn refusal to grasp it all. He writes with humour and enthusiasm, pulling out interesting characters and discoveries from the history of the Periodic Table and its elements.I’m just not as into chemistry/physics as I am biology. Even organic chemistry. I should be, but, alas. So I found that this dragged a bit — for me. It’d probably be unfair to assume it’d drag for you as well, if you’re actually a fan of chemistry.Originally reviewed on my blog."
180,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,4,"Stop the search. Recall the teams. I have found the non-fiction, summer read of 2010! The Disappearing Spoon.First, what’s a summer read, Mr. Josey Wales thumbnail photo? A summer read is one you can enjoy during a vacation to the beach, with fresh cocktails and clean towels provided by the swarthy, bronzed attendant at a seafront hotel. You can finish it in a few days in bite-sized chunks, it doesn’t overpower you academically, you learn a little, and the subject is something entirely new to you, which allows you to ‘escape’ mentally just as you are physically from that 50-hour, weekly cubicle career and hateful commuter traffic.The book catalogues the 200 year history of the piecemeal development of the periodic table in chemistry. Wait, this is not your high school chemistry class! Sam Kean uses the most idiosyncratic, unusual, serendipitous, and funny events to tell this story. You learn as much about the brilliant, boisterous, bi-polar, bastardly, and braggadocio scientists as you learn about each element on the periodic table. Each of 19 chapters pulls together several periodic elements and outlines their unexpected similarity and relatedness--atomically, quantumly and culturally. And the narrative moves fluidly back and forth through time to capture the relevant history of each element. The book highlights discoveries that are still being made, current as of late 2009.Strontium, Molybdenum, Ruthenium, Francium, Ytterbium. Neptunium, Berkelium, Californium, Lawrencium. What are you all about? How were you discovered? Why are you so important? And why the heck are you so rare? This is neat science told in a fun and effervescent way. There are some awesome, awe-inspiring, and yet sometimes pedestrian, elements out there. Science ofttimes moves forward in jumps and spurts, and Kean is quick to relate how it moves chaotically, unexpectedly, bizarrely, and accidentally. The author reviews not just core chemistry but also history, physics, cosmology, and psychology. The scientists and their Rube Goldberg experiments are as interesting as the results. Periodic elements are really cool (yes, I actually said that). They’re phenomenal, toxic, powerful, rare, ephemeral, magical, radioactive, and have the most interesting relationships to each other. We’re told why, when, and how they’ve been used and abused through history, and how they shepherded great leaps in the advancement of human civilization.The Disappearing Spoon is quick, light reading out in the sun. It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way. Kean uses good rhythm in the book, chapters of uniform length, and a bit of humor to bring it all home. He pulls it off effectively--Mr Wizard meets chaos theory. Sixth grade, mall, ‘wow’-science is discussed right next to the paragraph about how to produce absolute zero or 35 million degrees, both of which, incidentally, are created by lasers.In the end, you’ll learn a little, laugh a little. You may not remember anything from this book 2 years from now, but you will retain this: elements are neat as hell, and thank goodness for chemists and physicists. New words: depilatory, eluted"
181,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,0,"My GR friend Jason writes sturdy and trustworthy reviews, but I must take exception with him here :The Disappearing Spoon is quick, light reading out in the sun. It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way.Yes, it is all that, IF such stuff as this makes sense to you :The strongest solo acid is still the boron-based carborane (HCB11C111) And this boron acid has the best punchline so far : it's simultaneously the world's strongest and gentlest acid. To wrap your head around that, remember that acids split into positive and negative parts. In carborane's case you get H+ and an elaborate cagelike structure formed by everything else (CB11C111-) With most acids it's the negative portion that's corrosive and caustic and eats through the skin. But the boron cage forms one of the most stable molecules ever invented. Its boron atoms share electrons so generously that it practically becomes helium, and it won't go around ripping electrons from other atoms, the usual cause of acidic carnage.Well, this could be part of the rules of Quidditch for all the sense it makes to poor general reader me, so I think The Disappearing Spoon is really for science geeks who think stuff about German chemists being hornswoggled out of a Nobel Prize for Alchemy by some Californian sharpies in 1951 or a neat account of the crucial properties of the biomolecule which are called handedness is the very thing for those moments on the beach when there isn't any eye candy around."
182,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3504278-kate,4,"Okay. Let me tell it to you honestly.This book is not the most well written book - the sentences are clunky and there is not a clear narrative. It is much more of a rambling collection of stories and facts and quirky science knowledge.That said, I couldn't get back to reading this fast enough. I thought about a book about the scientific table throughout the day. I stole a few minutes wherever I could. I carried this book with me and was even *gasp* early to pick up the kids so that I could read a few minutes in the car.I mean, the opening factoid is about our ability to trace Lewis & Clark's trail by following the mercury laced poop trail. I love that shit. Growing up, I never loved science. I didn't learn the periodic table in school like others did. And so, there were times in this book, where I only understood a few clauses in each paragraph because the concepts were so advanced, but the author did a great job of bringing it back to a laypersons' comprehension in the next paragraph. So, in summary, this book is written for all levels of science (or not) nerds. It is full of incredible tales and the fun secrets and stories of the people involved in the development of the periodic table (and science as we know it).I will absolutely be rereading this book - most definitely when the boys are learning the periodic table in school."
183,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,4,"This is an absolutely brilliant idea for a book and it’s a superb book. It’s beautifully organized and well written. It’s a wonderful way to learn and/or deepen knowledge of chemistry. This book is fine for laypeople, but will give meaning and extra enjoyment even for advanced chemistry students. Much appreciated by me was that the information imparted was over my head only a very few times, and that’s saying a lot, because I’ve never taken a chemistry class.This book covers the elements of the periodic table via its history and by telling stories about the various elements: their history of discovery, how they’ve been used at various times, various people who found ways to make use of them. Anyone with a smidgen of curiosity about any aspect of life should find many things here that they find interesting. So many subjects are covered including astronomy, war, South Pole exploration, health and illness and poisoning, history, other sciences, the personalities of those who have contributed to the findings in the field, and so much more. It’s jam packed with useful facts and enjoyable stories. The relevance of the elements (chemistry) in everyday life is made so clear.There are many lovely digressions that turn out not to be digressions at all. There were very amusing parts, including funny quips that frequently pop up, and all of those quips have substance. It has a sort of gossipy (in a good way) tone. I learned so much. I found out that I love Linus Pauling and many other scientists who’ve contributed to the field. I was surprised how much of what’s been discovered in the field of chemistry has been done fairly recently, and how it’s still a growing, living scientific endeavor. While I’ve always been interested in science, and I did want a chemistry set when I was a child (request denied), I knew deplorably little about chemistry. Like the author, I loved playing with growing balls of mercury from broken thermometers. Quite a few of the elements themselves were, of course, familiar to me, but I didn’t know much about them. I had a bit of chemistry in other college science classes and in nutrition class. As I read, I frequently wished I’d memorized the table before reading this book. There is a table of the elements in the back of the book but it includes abbreviations only; it is not embellished; there is no list of elements by name next to it. However, in the index, thankfully, the elements are listed in bold, and I referred to that index at the beginning of every chapter when some elements were listed, in what looked to me like unusual Scrabble tiles. I read the notes as I read along, and they were easy to find because they started with page number and beginning of phrase in bold as a match their section in the book, but I’d still rather they’d have been included in the text proper to make the information even easier to read and to make it flow more smoothly.This book should be part of every beginning chemistry class. It makes the subject so interesting. This is certainly not the only attempt to make chemistry a great deal of fun for everyone. The book mentions the Tom Lehrer song, The Elements (which can be seen in many places including here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYW50F...).I really enjoyed this book, although I did end up reading it slowly, and I did take one break to read the young adult novel Mockingjay, which I’d been waiting to read for nearly a year.This is a gem of a book and such a great idea. I adored the humor, and there was a lot of it. I’ll let readers see for themselves why the book’s title is what it is.I hope that Sam Kean (or someone) writes similar books about physics, mathematics, etc. etc. I would definitely read them if they were as clever as this book."

What a lot of baloney! The Disappearing Spoon is, quite literally, one of the most fascinating, informative, FUNNY, books about the Periodic Table that I've ever read. Okay, it is the only book about the Periodic Table that I've ever read - but it is amazing. For those who love science or for those who simply would like to better under the elements that make the cosmos what it is, then this is a must read for you!! As for the ""disappearing spoon"" trick - well, you'll just have to read the book to find out the secret to this parlor trick for yourself! You'll be glad that you did! "

To that goodreads troll I now have an answer: this book.If you had told me a few weeks ago that I'd find a book about chemistry and the periodic table of elements difficult to put down, I'd have had a hard time believing you. But I did. This book was funny, interesting, even gripping at times, and always engaging. I took off a star because I'll admit that I didn't get all of it despite the author's best efforts. I guess it would take more than a fun book to turn me into a chemistry person. But it was still a wonderful read, and not a guilty pleasure because it was actually educational. This meant I could feel virtuous for once while I ignored my various responsibilities in favor of more reading.So not only did I get to enjoy a good book, I feel vindicated in my ongoing belief that a a sufficiently good writer can make any topic interesting, even to a reluctant reader. Yes – sometimes it pays to leave your reading comfort zone. And when it doesn’t, you have every right to complain because it is about the book, not just about a personal bias with regard to the content. For a good book, there should be no such thing as a “right” or “wrong” reader."
186,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431873-emily,3,"This book took me 76 days, or almost three months, to read. In this case, I needed all seventy-six individual days to work my brain through passages like this one:
For instance, thirteen aluminium atoms grouped together in the right way do a killer bromine: the two entities are indistinguishable in chemical reactions. This happens despite the cluster being thirteen times larger than a single bromine atom and despite aluminium being nothing like the lacrimatory poison-gas staple ... The clusters work like this. The atoms arrange themselves into a three-dimensional polyhedron, and each atom in it mimics a proton and a neutron in a collective nucleus. The caveat is that electrons can flow around inside this soft nucleic blob, and the atoms share the electrons collectively. Scientists wryly call this state of matter ""jellium.""
All you need to know is that I'm sort of an idiot. If you read the above passage and thought, ""This makes perfect sense! What an appropriate way to explain jellium, a state I've always been interested in!"", then you are less of an idiot than me and will probably enjoy this book very much. To give more context, here's how much of an idiot I am: when I took physics at Stanford (on the way to my successful minor! ha!), I had a lot of trouble with electricity and optics. To study, I did literally every single problem from those chapters, and I did the word problems multiple times. When I got to the final, I immediately recognized one of the problems I had done at least four times, was jubilant for about 2 seconds, and then realized I had absolutely no idea how to do it. (I think I only got half credit.) That is how good I am at squashing scientific concepts into my brain. On the positive side, I find all of this very interesting, and because I forget it so quickly, I have a lifetime of renewed discoveries ahead of me."

I was fascinated by the many details about the hunt for elements, the private lives of the Curies, the radioactive boy scout, the dangers of storing rare elements in the Congo, and that the same man who invented nitrogen rich fertilizers, is also the inventor of zyklon B. It also made me want to read more about The Manhattan Project, so I guess its time to put the Rhodes book on my wishlist."

This book is rich in empirical evidence and interesting tales of the last 200 years of history and discoveries of the chemical elements of the periodic table. However, the countless stories lacked the threads that could have given them a common fabric.The periodic table, which is currently comprised of 118 elements (112 at the time the book was written), is an ongoing process. The number of elements in our 14 billion year old universe increased over time. Right after the Big Bang a couple of elements formed, but later through nuclear fusion in stars, and stellar explosions known as supernovas, created and released the other naturally occurring elements. The remaining elements in the periodic table are synthetic (woman-made / man-made). The book walks us through Mendeleev's periodic table of elements that is composed of the main ingredients that chemists, physicists, and other scientist use for their recipes and experiments. The author shares many amusing background stories on how numerous chemical elements were isolated and shaped the way wars were fought, politics conducted, and relationships impacted.We see how women, like Marie Skłodowska Curie, her daughter Irene, Lise Meitner, and others played a pivotal role in the evolution of the periodic table.The author also recognizes that science, as a whole, was greatly contributed by immigrants.Somewhere in the first quarter of the book an interesting question was asked by Kean and that is whether theory or experiments are responsible for the advancement of science? I wish this question was further elaborated. The reader will definitely walk away with a considerable amount of interesting information, but not enough understanding of the subject matter. The author spent almost the whole book informing, rather than teaching and challenging me to think. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting a tour of the chemical elements and their backstories.[I read the Montenegrin (Serbian / Croatian / Bosnian) translation Kašika koja nestaje - autor Sem Kin. Laguna 2018 Publishing / 459 pages / 111,901 words. Great translation.]"

It's not poorly written (though it ain't Solzhenitsyn) and it's not that uninteresting of a topic, but I just found that after the first 40ish pages, I dreaded having to read more. It was like pulling teeth, only a bit less painful, even without the option of novocaine.I think part of it was that the book wasn't well organized. The author seemed to jump around the periodic table at his whim without keeping a consistent framework (perhaps that was the point, it was a bit unclear to me). Anyway, the writing is OKish enough and it is certainly very well researched, so I can understand why many people have liked it. And it's really not a bad science book, but for some reason I just found myself having a viscerally negative reaction to having to read the next chapter (well I guess I didn't have to keep reading on, but whatever). I don't know, I wish I could pinpoint the source of my discontent with this, but it is what it is, so feel free to try it out for yourself."

I feel like I learned some things, which isn't that difficult of a feat since what I remember from my high school chemistry class has more to do with the people sitting near me (we called ourselves the Peanut Gallery). I have vague memories of a teacher, the great Thorstein Sabo, who tried to teach us about the periodic table by telling us stories about electrons playing cribbage in the electron hotel. I didn't really get it. This book groups different elements, and tells stories about them in context of political intrigue, devastating consequences, and lifesaving discoveries. Coincidentally, I am also reading Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age, a book with a lot of parallels to The Disappearing Spoon. Where The Disappearing Spoon demonstrates how war interrupts scientific process, Rites of Spring shows the same about war interfering in the arts. You have to wonder how much farther, or at least different, both science and the arts would be, had we never had the world wars consuming the first half of the twentieth century.The tiny pieces of information I didn't know would fill a book, this book. It would be impossible to even recite them, but I particularly enjoyed the story of argyria, silver poisoning, and the senate/governor hopeful who drank collodial silver in preparation for Y2K. Argyria turns your skin blue... permanently. Papa smurf!I also made a note to myself to check out the poet Lowell, who is one of the first people to be treated with Lithium for mental illness. Salt (not an element) was also put into perspective with Ghandi and enforced iodine and I just don't know whether to be grateful that my government is preventing birth defects or to be freaked out that they are adding things like iodine to salt and fluoride to the water. The audiobook was great for this. Sean Runnette has a unique voice that I enjoyed in zombie stories but still translated well to science!I will leave you with a song I could not get out of my head during my listen to the second half of the book."

Not because I wasn't enjoying the book: it's readable, fascinating, and chock full of the very anecdotes about science and scientists that I love. So then, why the hell did I find this book so hard?It's precisely because the book is a collection of anecdotes that it was so hard to read. I felt like I was trying to grasp quicksilver (mercury, symbol Hg from Latin hydragyrum, meaning “water silver”) as this steady diet of atomic information arrived. Actually, that's a lousy metaphor: quicksilver is a glistening hypnotic liquid because its atoms stick together. These atomic anecdotes didn't: nothing stuck in my head, nothing stuck to each other. There was no overall organizing principle to the book that I could divine, and reluctantly I finished it barely the wiser than I begun.This book demands flashcards. I want to know the anecdotes.

I recognized a lot of the science names but learned some knew things about them.

Assumes a level of scientific knowledge not necessarily found in a casually curious science neophyte. IOW, way over my head. Rather hard to maintain focus and interest when you are barely understanding the composition of the simplest atoms. My take aways from the book are that the Periodic Table is drawn the way that it is beyond formatting choices. There are reasons that every element is located where it is on the table. The fact that the Periodic Table is mapped the way it is, is a scientific marvel. Also, Helium is the only element on the Periodic Table that doesn't combine with any other elements to form molecules. It sees itself as perfect. That's it. My sum total take away from the book. Some rather lucky and stupid scientists travails too...3.5ish rounded down because I forgot what element the disappearing spoon was. The stories didn't stick.Listened to the audiobook.

The degree of anthropomorphizing of atoms in the introductory chapters has left me completely puzzled about the actual science involved. I have no idea what it means that oxygen is ""a bully."" Does oxygen shake down other atoms for electrons? How does that even work?However, the chapter on chemical warfare has been (disturbing but) interesting. If the rest of the book is historical-figures character-driven, rather than atomic character-driven, then my overall opinion of the book should improve. Ugh, spoke too soon. Most of the chapter discusses chemical warfare in Europe around the World Wars. Therefore, most of the chapter is about named individuals -- chemists and soldiers and heads of state. And then one gets to the last four pages which are about how the cell phone industry's demand for niobium and tantalum fed the war in the Congo... a war which is all tribalism and ancient grudges (unlike Europe's wars?). ""Gruesome stories have circulated about proud victors humiliating their victims' bodies by draping themselves with entrails and dancing in celebration."" Lurid detail, but with no names, no location, no citations. I wish I were kidding. Gruesome stories circulated about 'the Hun' during the war, too, but I didn't see those stories getting a whole lot of coverage in this science book and for good reason -- so why are the stories about Congolese atrocities getting uncritically repeated here? And then to just win at post-colonialism, he unironically quotes Joseph Conrad, who ""once called Congo, 'the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human consceince,' and there's little reason to revise that notion today.""

196,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,Okay I will start by saying this is a fascinating book but you will need some understanding of the periodic table and chemistry - now I am not saying you need to be degree level but it will make some of the references a little easier to spot and the importance of some of the statements just that little more dramatic. That said and I have read a number of chemistry books both for fun and for academic reasons (yes okay I am chemist) but I did like how the author approached the subject of each chapter. I will admit that it did sort of follow a formula in that he would explain the focus of the chapter (which element or family of elements) a long with hints of entertaining stories and anecdotes. He would then go back to these stories and explain them further - with the idea that he would reinforce the message of each chapter. So I guess you would have the technical scholarly part followed by the humorous and entertaining story. For me I thought this was a great way of bringing the message home without either being boring or overbearing. This is a great book for those interested in chemistry. Yes by the nature of the book it focuses on the elements and little of their compounds (although it does talk about their chemistries) but its a great launch pad in to further studies 
197,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This book is quite an entertaining read. It is packed with interesting anecdotes about scientists who explored the outer fringes of the periodic table. I even learned a little bit of chemistry. The book is organized in an intelligent manner--each chapter is devoted to some theme, with a small group of elements that fit into that theme in some way. Sometimes the author strays from the exploration of elements, but he always seems to relate to the chapter's theme. The only thing that puts me off a bit, is the author's style. It is a rather folksy style, where the words ""um"", ""well"", and ""friggin"" can be found in the middle of a sentence."
198,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"In a breezy style, Kean intersperses chemistry and physics with a potpourri of stories revolving around the elements. He explains how the elements formed and how they were discovered. He blends complex science and human interest in his examples of how the elements have been used and influenced history. Kean transitions quickly from deep discussions of atomic structure or quantum mechanics to oddities such as the nutcase who turned blue eating silver because he thought there would be no antibiotics after Y2K. Kean tries to make difficult concepts comprehensible such as the fine structure constant and why it is so fundamental to our understanding of the universe. He also fills his book with obscure facts such as how many ounces of the element astatine there are on the earth. The answer is one. And if you find it, it will be gone before you can do anything with it. Kean serves up tidbits of the lives of the scientists including their personal and professional quirks and claims to fame. He focuses on the developers of the periodic table from Mendeleev who is credited with the original to Glenn Seaborg whose discoveries of super heavy elements expanded it. We learn about Linus Pauling’s unraveling of the structure of protein and his misguided attempt to be the first to crack the structure of DNA. Crick and Watson cagily won that race. He discusses the discovery of quantum mechanics from Max Planck’s initial findings about the spectral distribution of black body radiation to Einstein’s concept of energy as a particle and on through Bohr, Heisenberg and others. These are just a few of the brief vignettes of famous scientists in Kean’s book. The Disappearing Spoon is full of good stuff for those who want their science lightened up by entertaining sidebars. It’s a bit of a teaser. Kean gives you just enough to get interested in a topic. So I found myself frequently going on line or considering getting something more in depth. The book’s diversity makes it a great way to find something new you might want to know more about. It’s also the perfect book for readers with short attention spans."

At the same time, The Disappearing Spoon wasn't like a lecture in the least bit, and instead folded tons of scientific information into stories about the scientists and their accomplishments. I'd recommend it to anyone who's curious about a subject they may have only encountered at the 101 level."
200,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3548626-ian-tregillis,4,"This is a rare specimen among the books I tend to read: a two-bookmark book. I was skeptical when this first came to my attention. I grew up reading any and every science-related book I could find. My early fascination with books about science -- particularly chemistry and physics -- led, many years later, to my day job career. (I also blame Dr. Who for this, but that's a longer story.) But it was a long road, and not surprisingly along the way I lost my enthusiasm for reading books about science topics in my spare time. I always have, and always will, love the fact that people are writing and reading them. But somewhere, along the way to becoming an adult, the stuff I used to love as a kid started to feel like... homework. Like taking my work home with me.I thought a book filled with strange anecdotes related to the Periodic Table sounded like a terrific idea for folks that would be interested in such things. But that I would not be one of those people. This, in spite of the fact that when I was much younger (before I finally got to learn about all the stuff I wanted to learn) I used to spend hours staring at the Periodic Table, studying it, trying and failing to unpack its arcane secrets. (And yet somehow I'd completely forgotten about that until I read this book. This book deserves four stars just on the basis of helping me remember this.) Eventually I learned about the mathematics of atoms, and how this gives rise to the Periodic Table. And it was glorious. But then I grew up. Life as an adult is heavy on the mortgage payments, lighter on the soul-stirring wonderment.So, yeah. I figured I didn't need to read a book about the table because I already knew how it worked. It's still true I didn't need to read this book, but the 10-year-old inside me sure did. I'm glad I listened to him.Sam Kean (who, judging from his photo on the rear flap, could be a friend's lost twin) adopts a casual, easygoing tone, which keeps the book easily readable, even when the subject matter might become dry in less capable hands. He touches on the scientific underpinnings of the subject when necessary yet never gets bogged down in the weeds. And though he glosses over the details in places (as is the only right thing to do in a book like this) his explanations make for clear, concise distillations of the subject matter. Never did I find myself tempted to skim, even when I was familiar with the background details. I'd heard a few of the stories in this book, but only a few, and those I'd either misremembered or learned incorrectly in the first place. Much of the information in this book was new to me, but all of it was fascinating. This is much more than a book about the elements and the table upon which they reside; it's also a book about the people who discovered them, loved them, hated them, yearned for them, tried to recreate them. As such, it's filled with remarkable and fascinating tidbits. I didn't know that exposure to tellurium can make a person reek like garlic. I didn't know that beryllium tastes like sugar. (Where I work, the eating of beryllium is discouraged.) I didn't know about the World War I fight over a nearly defunct mine in Colorado. I didn't know that Fritz Haber was such an epic tool. I didn't know that the ""S"" of the BCS theory of superconductivity went to prison.Much of the most fascinating and entertaining material is tucked away in extensive footnotes. The footnote section is worth reading just on its own. The author clearly couldn't resist including many of the little tidbits he'd learned in the course of his research. But rather than breaking the logical development of each section with a tangential anecdote, he leaves the digressions to the footnote section. This section is worth reading just on its own. The notes appear so frequently that I needed two bookmarks, so that I could flip back and forth between the body text and the footnotes section. If you do decide to pick this up, absolutely do not skip the footnotes. Some of the best stuff is in there. Much of it isn't strictly related to the periodic table, but it's golden just the same.The book is organized logically, following the first attempts to classify the elements through to cutting-edge speculations about the ""island of stability"", quantum dots, and other current topics. Each chapter is organized around a theme -- Elements in Times of War, Elements as Money, The Elements of Madness, Poisoner's Corner, etc. The narrative thread of each chapter weaves its way through multiple boxes on the periodic table. (In a lovely piece of book design, the periodic table entries for the relevant elements appear at the top of each chapter.) Kean does an enviable job of developing each chapter logically, and deserves much credit for finding such clean paths through what could have become thickets. In a few places, the narrative's relationship to the chapter theme felt a little forced. But the information along the way is so fun, and presented so well, that I never cared. "
201,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063661-woodge,4,"This book was an interesting compendium of stories linking up the various elements of the Periodic Table. Not only did I learn about the various scientists who discovered this or that element, but I learned a good deal about many of the elements themselves. It was entertaining enough that I kept coming back to it to read more. I've got a much better understanding now of elements and what makes them differ from each other. And I didn't even realize that elements can change (or decay) into other elements. Never really thought about it, I guess. Now I know how it can happen (though not every element does this.) Lots of cool facts and odd stories about odd scientists are embedded in this book. Recommended for anyone interested in science, especially those without a Ph.D. It's rocks for jocks. "

It makes chemistry and physics comprehensible and fun. I listened to it in audio and thought the narrator did a fantastic job with it. He actually made the jokes sound funny. He knew what tone the author was striving for and he hit it spot-on. However, I think I ended up missing a lot by listening rather than reading. The book is so packed full of fun facts and numbers and, of course, references to the periodic table. I'm sure there were charts and diagrams I just didn't get in an audiobook.

The Periodic Table! Chemistry! How could I possibly be completely enthralled by such a book? How could I dare give it five stars when I wasn't able to truly understand a lot of what I read?Because of the writing, pure and simple.Kean makes chemistry accessible for the willing-to-make-an-intellectual-effort layperson - but it's not just the chemistry. It's the characters BEHIND the chemistry, the stories of their discoveries and the things they overlooked. It's about the politics and the culture and the drama of the creation of that little set of boxes that we're all so familiar with.I was fascinated.I have found myself sharing little anecdotes with my (yes, young) children and my friends. I pulled out the book at dinner tonight and had to tell the story of that ""disappearing spoon"" to everyone at the table. I loved the history, both in our modern world and the earth itself. It feels like this knowledge is so essential to human life, that these things he is talking about are, literally, at the root of what we're all made of and Kean is just able to share that information in an interesting and not-your-stuffy-old-professor style.Yes, there is a lot of science in there, but don't be scared though. You can still get so much out of the stories if you're willing to let yourself gloss over the really deep stuff and just glean as much out of it as you can. I'm going to return my copy to the library and then buy my own, so I can read parts of it again. I liked it that much. "
208,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5310185-qoh,3,"This book takes a monumental topic -- the periodic table -- and breaks it down into various digestible topic areas. While I enjoyed it (and learned a lot of history of science trivia I'd been unaware of, what with my head stuck in the 18th century) and had a few ""a-ha"" moments as some organic chemistry concepts FINALLY made sense to me (14 years after my last ochem class), I have two big problems with the book. -1 star because the book needed editing. Badly. Kean's writing is usually OK, but sometimes forced, folksy, and pedantic. I could go from enjoyment to annoyance to wanting to throw it across the room and/or get out my red pen. -1 star because there is no comprehensive bibliography, which is a cardinal sin in a book about science, just a short list of books. I have no doubt he did a lot of research, but there should be *some* accountability. Instead, in endnotes, there are more folksy stories (that require flipping to the back of the book to read, and which were usually only tangential and not particularly interesting footnotes to the main story, meaning the flow was disrupted for no good reason). In any case: interesting topic, good stories, only OK execution, and little authorial accountability. I really can't see myself reading anything Kean writes in the future unless he cites his sources and drops the folksy facade. "

There’s all kinds of random facts, and he makes things like electron shells very clear — even for me, with my brain’s stubborn refusal to grasp it all. He writes with humour and enthusiasm, pulling out interesting characters and discoveries from the history of the Periodic Table and its elements.I’m just not as into chemistry/physics as I am biology. Even organic chemistry. I should be, but, alas. So I found that this dragged a bit — for me. It’d probably be unfair to assume it’d drag for you as well, if you’re actually a fan of chemistry.Originally reviewed on my blog."
210,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/981514-minli,4,"Entertaining read--and a fascinating subject matter. I'm definitely the right audience for this book: someone who knows some chemistry but didn't get any higher degrees in it, and is more interested in the historical, cultural building of the periodic table than the hard science.Kean's wry prose never lets you forget that his point of view is subjective and conversational: he paints caricatures of famous scientists and makes ridiculous analogies. His audience is undoubtedly American. He does his best to explain concepts (some of which I still remembered!) in layman's terms, though I kind of dozed off at the discussion of alpha. He does a good job giving awesome lady scientists their due, like Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin, Maria Groppert-Mayer and Marie Curie. I learned a bunch of things, how thallium is the worst ever poison (the poisoner's poison) and that cobalt-60 is the dirtiest and worst ever a-bomb. The structuring of the elements grouped into chapters, chapters grouped into parts, gave the book a flow and rhythm. It might have benefited from a longer conclusion.This book has made me feel like the biggest dork ever, because when people mention some element now, I have to squash the impulse to say, ""Hey! Did you know that...""The Disappearing Spoon also showed to me what my chemistry, biology and physics teachers in high school and college never did: how magical, weird, wonderful, temperamental, dangerous and dramatic science can be, how they're heterogeneously mixed with Romance and politics.

Beyond that, it's filled with interesting stories about the people who helped build the table and discover many of its elements, as well as other events that revolve around said elements. I particularly enjoyed the one about Germany's clandestine operations in the U.S. during WWI.One nitpick I had with this book: Every 2-3 pages, you'll find an asterisk that corresponds to a footnote in the back of the book. I'm the kind of person who simply cannot ignore these, and as a result, constantly going to the back of the book to read them made it a bit harder for me to immerse myself in the main text. Now, this is mainly the fault of my own brain, so I'm not subtracting anything from my score for it. Just be aware of this fact if you happen to be like me. Personally, I think the footnotes would have been less distracting if they were put on the actual page where they were referenced.Still, this book was really enjoyable. I look forward to digging into Kean's newer works when I've got some time."

Subtitle: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the ElementsWho could have imagined such a volume written about that chart that hangs in every high school chemistry classroom? I’m an admitted science geek. I loved the “Mr Wizard” TV show when I was a kid. (He encouraged us to perform all sorts of experiments using our mother’s kitchen utensils and supplies.) I never wanted a Barbie doll, I wanted a chemistry set and a microscope! So, I’ve had this book on my TBR list since it first came out. And I have to say that I’m a little disappointed.It’s not that Kean is a bad writer; he isn’t, and he’s quite thorough in exploring this topic. His enthusiasm and fascination for the periodic table comes through. But, it was just too much even for this science geek. Some parts were far more interesting to me than others. I loved the chapter on poisons, for example. I was less enthralled with the political infighting on what name to give to a newly discovered element. Also, I made the choice to listen to the audio format. Sean Runnette did a fine job of performing the audio. However, the sometimes dry subject matter made for a more difficult listening experience. I might have enjoyed this more in text."
213,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3349963-craig-cottingham,4,"I was a chemical engineering major in college, so some of the background information (like the basics of the periodic table) was familiar to me and therefore a little tedious to read. Outside of that, however, this was a fascinating book that I think would be accessible to non-beakerheads.Each chapter is devoted to a group of elements that are related. Instead of going for the obvious groupings (the inert gasses, the halogens, etc.) he comes at them from a refreshingly sideways direction. There's a chapter on poisons (from the obvious like arsenic, to thallium, which was responsible for thousands of deaths from contaminated groundwater in Japan) and another on measurements (from the international standard kilogram, which is an ingot of iridium, to the cesium-powered atomic clocks which define the international standard second). Each one reads a little like an episode of James Burke's TV series Connections, the way the discussion of one element blends into another. Sometimes the connections and the groupings are a little contrived, but not jarringly so, and I'm sure it was necessary to avoid a ""here are all the elements that didn't fit in anywhere else"" chapter.Highly recommended."
214,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"There’s a lot packed into this book. I enjoyed the look of the history of the periodic table; how it got started, the changes made over time, the discoveries of elements. Intermingled are the stories of the people; the scientists who figured things out and made things happen. Intertwined yet again are the stories of the theory and workings of atoms; what makes them tick, what makes them unique, what makes them react. Then there’s all those scientists; some humorous, some deceitful or crazy for fame. I really enjoyed the bit about the periodic table in the future and how the table if ever-changing and expanding. This is a wonderful book for those who enjoy chemistry, physics and anything “earthy”. "
215,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Fun romp through the periodic table - lots of chemistry and physics, but even more stories about science and the people who do it. Sam Kean has fun with history. The book is not very technical, but approachable and occasionally humorous. The stories are diverse - there are many elements on the table, so we jump around quite a bit. I enjoyed this on audio, found it both educational and entertaining, but I probably won’t remember much as there is no common storyline other than the stories being about elements."
216,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,2,"Uneven and only fitfully engaging, The Disappearing Spoon is less a history of the periodic table and how scientists have come to understand elemental matter than it is a collection of facts about those elements and anecdotes about the various researchers who've discovered them. Sam Kean doesn't really have the knack for explaining (or re-explaining) scientific concepts to people who haven't studied chemistry or physics since secondary school, and relies too much on clunky metaphors and irritating anthropomorphisms. (For example, Kean writes that stars are ""[d]esperate to maintain high temperatures."" Stars are not sentient. They do not have feelings. Even more jaw-droppingly asinine, though, are sentences like ""In addition to Haber's being a Jew, Germany excommunicated him because he had become passé."" Do I need to break down why this is, at an absolute minimum, a tacky way of putting things?) He never actually fully explains how the periodic table works.More damningly to me, as a historian, is that Kean tries to write from a perspective which is determinedly presentist. His interest in the past seems to primarily stem from wanting to know the backstory of the discovery and refinement of certain scientific concepts, rather than any desire to engage with the history of science as an evolving conceptual system which is inevitably shaped by those who practice it. For a man who seems fascinated by the universe on scales both macro and micro, Kean seems profoundly uninterested in the human."

There were a few times when the author simplified technical explanations, which I think made it more confusing. For that reason, I almost gave this book a 4. However there were enough moments where my mind was completely blown that I decided it had to be a 5. The first chapter is boring, but it is well worth pushing through. (What is it with science and very boring first chapters. Always. Start with something that draws me in for cryin' out loud!) There is a fascinating chapter on elements in times of war (Gold? Who needs gold? Give me molybdenum and tungsten.) and of course causing wars. A chapter that delves into lasers and masers (Holy shit, this was awesome! Seriously? How did I not know how lasers work? How did I learn all of the basic principles in physics, but I never learned how they come together in the most fantastic, brilliant way? I am happy to have rectified this situation.) and also the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a newish state of matter where a few thousand atoms becomes ""one giant marshmallow"" of an atom-a singularity and on a macro scale. This chapter ends with:""As technology keeps improving, scientists have gotten better and better at inducing matter to form the BEC. It's not like anyone's taking orders yet, but scientists might soon be able to build 'matter lasers' that shoot out ultra-focused beams of atoms thousands of times more powerful that light lasers, or construct 'supersolid' ice cubes that CAN FLOW THROUGH EACH OTHER WITHOUT LOSING THEIR SOLIDITY [emphasis mine]."" If I were a science teacher, the very next thing I would do after teaching this is have my students write a sci-fi story touching on where this technology is going next. What's it like to live in a world where solids can flow through each other? I know it's impossibly silly, but I immediately imagined humans that can walk through walls and stuff like that. Of course, this only happens at way below zero temperatures and on a very small scale. But you know, a girl can dream. There's also a chapter called ""Poisoner's Corridor: 'Ouch-Ouch'."" No need to elaborate. There's a chapter on elements as currency and of course fraud. There's even a section on how elements deceive our sense of taste-fascinating! (An example- chewing potassium gymnemate will make raw sugar heaped on your tongue taste like sand)Some other awesome tidbits:The person who discovered x-rays thought he went mad when he first saw the bones of his hands and a key hidden in a book. ""The primary component of taste, smell, is the only sense that bypasses our logical neural processing and connects directly to the brain's emotional centers.""""And whereas electrons absorb and emit light of the same color (yellow in, yellow out), fluorescent molecules absorb high-energy light (ultraviolet light) but emit that energy as lower-energy, visible light."" That's why we can see scorpions glow in the dark under black lights! This is what makes UV visible to us! The most powerful lasers today can produce beams that for a fraction of a second produce more power than the whole United States.Seriously, this book goes all over the place, but still manages to be organized. Loved it! "
218,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie,3,"""The Disappearing Spoon"" teaches the chemistry and physics of atoms and the periodic table. It's taught primarily in the context of short biographies about the Noble prize winning scientists (plus some others) who discovered the various elements or who discovered important things about how the elements or atoms are put together.Based on the book description I was given, I was expecting more trivia about the elements and how they are and have been used rather than a book teaching science with a main focus on scientists. However, the author's casual, lively, and sometimes crude tone made the stories entertaining--probably even more so to young males than to me. I did get a little tired of the author's judgmental attitude, though. It seemed like every human action had to be either brilliant or insanely stupid.The author's explanations of how things worked (atoms, periodic table, etc.) were easy for me to follow, but that might partly be because I took a lot of science courses in college. The initial science lessons were high school level, but the ending lessons were more college level (though high schoolers can probably follow them).The book primarily focused on science and scientists, but there were a few stories of invention, greed, destruction or just plain weirdness based around non-scientists. Though I didn't actually check to make sure, it seemed like every element on the periodic table was covered at least briefly. Some of the areas in which he discussed the use of the elements were warfare (chemical warfare, nuclear bombs, dirty bombs), medicine, politics, art, biology (especially DNA), as poison, as money (counterfeiting, a strange gold rush), and under super-cool conditions. He also covered a Big Bang model of how the elements were formed (with a ""see, no god needed!"" emphasis), how radiometric dating methods were thought up and used to generate dates for the age of the Earth that were old enough to give biological evolution a chance of occurring (since previous dating methods gave too ""young"" of an age to allow for it), and how biases can prevent critical viewing of scientific data (though he didn't seem to notice his own bias).He worked a lot of ""there is no God, humans & Earth aren't special, and evolution is true"" apologetics into this book. I wouldn't mind so much if, in the appendix, he hadn't presented what ""young-earth creationists believe"" by mixing true statements with misrepresented and apparently ridiculous ones as well as completely inaccurate ones. So now, if these readers come across the true argument, they'll dismiss it without really considering it--they'll think they know all about it when they don't.There were a few black and white photographs of scientists and a few charts. Overall, the book was entertaining and interesting, though not so much so that I'd want to read it again. The people who'd be most interested by it are probably teen or college age males who idolize science as pure and untarnished but who also like somewhat scandalous tales about scientists, their competitions to make Noble-winning discoveries, and their fights over who made a discovery first.I received this Advanced Reader Copy for review purposes from the publisher. "
219,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author relates many anecdotes of the discovery and uses of several elements with (as he says about those who know the periodic table) ""dweeby nonchalance.” It is meant to be a readable, interesting book of popular science for the lay reader, and indeed it is full of fascinating anecdotes about all things elemental. (The titular spoon is made of gallium, metal that melts in low temperatures and therefore a spoon made of it dissolves in tea. Ha ha, periodic table practical jokes!) Based on the title alone, I expected a lot of anecdotes such as the battle over the molybdenum mine in Colorado during WWII to help the Nazi war effort, or endless spats over naming rights of elements, but this book contains so much more. The madman Fritz Haber and his chlorine gas experiments; how the niobium in your cell phone helped finance the brutal Congo wars; an overview of the Bose-Einstein Condensate, the fifth state of matter; Henry Moseley’s electron beam; the alpha constant; why silicon-based life forms are extremely unlikely; Cobalt 60 dirty bombs; Monte Carlo science, itai-itai disease caused by Cadmium poisoning from mining companies on Japan; the role of gadolinium in MRI machines and cancer fighting; the left or right ""handedness"" of proteins; sulfur bacteria and how it relates to the sense of taste; the longest ""word"" ever, a technical term that is too long to be written; why we can unknowingly breathe in nitrogen without gasping for air until we suddenly collapse and die; why idolaters of Gandhi dislike iodine; how a lack of salt in a person suggests the nonexistence of the soul; how brass might be the nugget of truth behind the King Midas myth; how the science of bubbles led to the discovery of radon; and more. As you can see, the scope of this work is vast, possibly too much so. While it is written in a personable, conversational style, I felt that Kean doesn't manage to convey to the meanest scientific intelligence (namely me) a full understanding of the science he uses in the book, such as the aforementioned alpha constant, or how exactly electrons move from their ""shells."" Such information isn't necessary to appreciate the scientific history here, so for me it would have been better off cut entirely if impossible to simplify. I don't need the technical details to approve of a book that tells us that Lewis and Clark's route can be traced by the trace mercury in their feces, or refers to a Mark Twain story in which Satan is depicted as being made of radium, or that Paul McCartney was awarded a rhodium record (rather than gold or platinum) for his unsurpassed sales. That's the stuff that keeps the lay reader in their seats."
220,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Sam Kean has written a witty, interesting book about the elements in the Periodic Table. He writes as if he was chatting with the reader in a coffee shop or a tavern, regaling his friends with one anecdote after another. He's imparting his knowledge of science by the use of quirky, fun facts and interesting stories about the scientists involved.This is not set up like a typical chemistry textbook. The chapters are divided into areas of interest such as astronomy, poisons, money, war, medicine, and periods of history. The author is a physicist so the book had a lot of information about elements made in the lab, radioactive elements, nuclear chemistry, and the atomic bomb. For me, that was the most challenging part of the book.He writes about Linus Pauling's theory of a triple helix being trumped by James Watson and Francis Crick's double helix model of DNA. The attractive Marie Curie was a source of gossip when she took men into dark closets to show them radioactive specimens. Ghandhi told the people of India to dry their own salt instead of paying a British salt tax, only to have many people develop goiter due to lack of iodine. The trail taken by Lewis and Clark is known because anthropologists found (poisonous) mercury capsules that the explorers were using as laxatives. These types of stories make science seem more approachable.The title of the book comes from a practical joke. Gallium, which resembles aluminum, is a solid below 84 degrees F, and can be molded into a spoon. When it is dipped into hot tea, the surprised guest finds the spoon disappearing as it melts away. (Youtube has some ""disappearing spoon"" videos.)This is a book that can be enjoyed by the lay person as well as a scientist. Some chapters will be much easier to understand if a reader has had an introduction to the Periodic Table, such as in a high school Chemistry course. I would have preferred having the footnotes on the bottom of the pages rather than in the back of the book. Overall, the author should be commended for making science fun."

Once the instructor talked about electrons, protons, atoms and the nucleus I usually turned on my Walkman (the cassette kind, now antique!). It never seemed interesting because it wasn't something that related at all to real life. If I had a teacher like Sam Kean, however, that could have been different.Fast forward too many years, and now I'm engrossed in this nonfiction 'memoir' of the Periodic Table of Elements. Like any good biography, this has scandal, lies, fraud, madness, explosions (!!!) and lots of name-dropping. Kean explains just what the periodic table is, but in a format that reads more like a novel, with anecdotal details to liven it up. Mercury pills were used by Lewis and Clark for their health? Yep, and you can trace their path (um, at least their bathroom trips on their journey) by where scientists have found unusually high amounts of mercury in the soil. The poet Robert Lowell? Did lithium ruin his work by making him sane? Who knew the lies and fraud and mind games played by scientists intent on getting a Nobel Prize! There's no getting around it, this is a book that makes you think. It's not simple and it assumes you have a basic knowledge of science. Some areas were over my head, but not for long. Kean is a wonderful teacher with a sassy wise guy voice that livens up any of the deeper areas."
222,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47354-dave,4,"For me this book was a pleasure to listen to. I plan to read a paper or e-book edition shortly. A delightful, an engaging blend of lyrical prose, historic anecdotes and fascinating information. Reminiscent, to me, of some of the writing of Lewis Thomas, Oliver Sacks, Barry Lopez, Edward Abbey and John McPhee.Brain/mind candy or chicken soup for the nerd's soul. Does that make me a dualist?The chapter essays are wide ranging anecdotal expositions of elements and families of elements. Not only stories about the scientists who prospected for and predicted the existence of certain elements, and created schemata for organizing them but about the influence of various elements on cultures, politics, economics and even philosophy. The stories added greatly to my appreciation for and understanding of the lives and work of some well known and some no longer famous scientists. The meditations on peculiar properties of some groups of atoms and alternative arrangements for the Periodic Table bumped my rating of the book from between 4 and 5 stars to clearly 5 stars. Others not so smitten on the history of science and mathematics may find it only mildly interesting or even boring. A must read for nerds, history buffs and fans of creative non-fiction. "
223,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2968341-linda-isakson,5,"I don't normally review non-fiction reads, but this one is just too superb to pass up! A wonderful and engaging read from cover-to-cover. Sam Kean takes the periodic table of the elements, a chart that makes most people cringe at thoughts of high school (or college) chemistry, and turns it into a riveting drama about the table's origins and the hunt to find new elements. Science geeks will love the scientific jargon but you don't need a degree in chemistry to understand the fascinating stories behind the revolutionaries responsible for our modern day technologies. This is definitely a book you can read over and over and still find little morsels you might have previously missed. Kean is amusing, insightful and presents complex information in a very understable package. A must read for fans of scientific history."
224,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18206572-inken,4,"I really enjoyed this book – even the parts I couldn’t understand. I so wish we’d had this as a set text when I took chemistry in high school. Not only might I have understood the rubbish our teacher was spouting, I might’ve liked it and even passed the bloody thing! Nobody ever even bothered to explain the Periodic Table to us and why it looks the way it does. And it's true: watching a gallium spoon dissolve in a glass of water is pretty cool.I had no idea the world of chemistry and physics was such a hotbed of rivalry, gossip and scandal. Delicious stuff."
225,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80835-celeste-ng,0,"Fascinating to me as the daughter of a chemist--I grew up with periodic tables all around, quite literally (I had a periodic table placemat!). Some of these stories were familiar to me, but most were new. Highly recommended for those who want to why the periodic table matters, and to know more about how the elements have changed human lives, sometimes drastically."
226,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40823165-yibbie,1," Never would I have assumed that I would have to quit reading a book about chemistry because of a lewd scene, but I did. In his attempt to introduce us to different chemicals and explain their lives, the author personifies them as characters in a smutty romance. So I quit what was up till then, an interesting book. "
227,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,5,"I’ve been reading a lot of non-fiction lately, and for me, that’s really...well, unusual. If you had asked me a couple of years ago how I felt about non-fiction, I would have described it as eye-glazingly dull, a dry recitation of facts. But now I eagerly scour the non-fiction shelves at the library. I know -- it’s crazy!The only explanation is that non-fiction has gotten better. (It can’t be me that’s changed.) The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean is a fine example of this better, more interesting non-fiction. Kean doesn’t skimp on the facts. He’s packed his book with oodles of information about the elements. What saves his book from being merely a mind-numbing collection of elemental characteristics may be gleaned from the book’s full title: The Disappearing Spoon and Other Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of Elements.Yes, it’s the madness and weirdness that brings the elements to life, and Kean seems to have dug up a fascinating story for virtually every element on the periodic table. For example, the title’s disappearing spoon refers to a (nerdy) practical joke in which unsuspecting victims are given a gallium spoon to stir their tea. I was particularly interested in the stories surrounding the radioactive elements, which ranged from an ex-KGB spy that was murdered with polonium-laced sushi in 2006 to a boy scout that tried to build his own nuclear reactor.Reading non-fiction like this is not only painless, but fun, and I’m convinced that I’m retaining all of those pesky little facts better that I normally would because I’ve so enjoyed learning them. Just wait until we meet at the next dinner party and I regale you with tales of elemental hijinks. If you’ve long despaired of enjoying non-fiction, perhaps now is the time to give it another try. "
228,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,4,"I pretty much knew I was going to like this book as soon as I heard about it. I mean, come on, it's about science! Some of the factoids I learned in this book will stick with me for a long time, like the naturally occurring nuclear reactor in Africa, or the reason why the Washington monument is capped with aluminum. At first I was disappointed that the book had end notes instead of footnotes. I do like footnotes. However, many of them were so long that I understood the reason for it. I ended up just having two bookmarks, one for where I was in the book, and one for where I was in the end notes.On one hand, there were sections that I feel I would have liked better if it hadn't been so long since my last chemistry class. On the other hand, if I were more well-versed in chemistry, some of the stories wouldn't have been so new and interesting to me.There were one or two slow sections in this book, but the interesting sections more than balanced it out. More to the point, this was a book that made me feel smarter for having read it--that goes a long way.One minor quibble that bothered me is that while there were two blank periodic tables which I found quickly, the actual periodic table in the book comes so close to the end that I wasn't able to find it, and I was looking for one. I would have liked to have one to reference. By the time I found it, I was almost done with the book and didn't need it as much. If the periodic table had been printed as an end paper, or in the beginning, or even at the start of the end notes where I could have found it, that would have made it easier to understand some of what the author talked about. After all, it's been a while since high school chemistry, and I only look at that chart periodically. (ha ha)"
229,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1951489-amanda,4,"Think back to your high school chemistry class. Chances are, the artwork adorning the classroom probably contained a poster with the periodic table of the elements. For some reason, all through 7 chemistry classes, my favorite was tungsten.Pop quiz - what is the chemical symbol for tungsten? Why, ""W"" of course! Why not T or Tu or Tg?? The ""W""is for wolfram, the German name for tungsten. Without it, those handy incandescent lightbulbs would not operate if it weren't for those tungsten filaments.I've always had a soft spot for science trivia, and the periodic table of the elements is full of interesting stories. If you have the same soft spot, I'd recommend ""The Disappearing Spoon"" by Sam Keane. The title references a property of the element gallium. Gallium turns from a solid to a liquid at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the author, a favorite prank of grad students is to fashion spoons made of gallium and to hand them out with tea or coffee. The spoon looks like the metal of other silverware, but when used in tea or coffee, melts away - a disappearing spoon!Another reason this is a great book is that it humanizes many of the famous scientists. In reading through textbooks, you never see into the personal lives or professional struggles of the discoveries and constants described in the text. Yet in The Disappearing Spoon, you see the races to get published (discovering and naming rights to elements), the discouragement at being passed up for a Nobel Prize yet again, and how wars and politics shape the or stunt technology."
230,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933518-jason,5,"Sometimes books just fall in my lap....Although I do pretty much put myself in a position where they seem to fall from the sky at a brisk rate. I went to Barnes & Noble the other day with the wife, ostensibly to get a cup of coffee, and picked up this book and Jose Saramago's 'The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'. I couldn't tell you what it was about it that caught my attention. I'm doing that thing again where I read too many books at once, but despite my inward pleas to the contrary, I couldn't resist picking it up and starting to read. What a great book. Refreshing, endlessly intriguing. Every page was a pleasure. Basically a book like this tells me two things: what a whiny spoiled brat I am, and what a complete dimwitted ape I am. In these pages I read about a woman who rode horseback for 1200 miles through a Russian winter to get her kid to a college only to see him rejected, and she then rode 400 more miles to get him to yet another school after which she promptly, and understandably, died. That's just so Russian. Then I read about a man who not only invented the Bunsen burner, he also invented the Spectrometer, and subsequently discovered several new elements, all in the 1850s. I look at myself and realize I'm liable to get suicidal if we run out of half and half, and my greatest achievement in life has been to arrange The Police's 'Roxanne' for the ukulele. Sometimes a good dose of perspective is extremely illuminating. "
231,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3387843-celine,4,"Did you love it when your teacher told funny science anecdotes? Then The Disappearing Spoon might be the book for you.This book is exactly what it is made out to be. With a full title of The Disappearing Spoon And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, it tells you everything you should know. Kean starts with the periodic table, talks about how it was created, and from there, tells of fun, tragic, or interesting stories about all of the elements.Most of the science in The Disappearing Spoon is understandable with a high-school knowledge of chemistry. But even if you don't know enough chemistry, those parts can easily be skipped. Most of the book is heavily inspired by scientific history, rather than science itself. If you want to know more about the bickering and rivalries between chemists, this book is perfect. The Disappearing Spoon is highly entertaining, and it's clear the author has done extensive research into the lives of the scientists he talks about. My only gripe is that he has the tendency to lose direction sometimes, and flounders between all of the threads of stories he started, no longer clear on exactly what point he wanted to make. "

This is at times a ""cute book"" but in spite of it's promise it will help you if you have a deep abiding love of chemistry before you crack it open.It doesn't really appear to be organized all that well and isn't truly geared to the average reader. He opens up with his early fascination with mercury (the element, not the planet or the mythological deity) and how it led him into literature etc. Then he sets out to induce us all into the wonder/wonders that is/are the periodic table. I wasn't drawn into chemistry beyond what's required in high school, neither was I here. It didn't work, I lost interest quickly and wasn't interested in going on with the class.Enjoy if it's cup of tea...not mine. Maybe you'll like it, but I can't recommend it."
233,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"A fun read, for a certain value of fun. This is a book for science geeks, or those curious about science. If you're a full-fledged science geek, this could be a relatively light side read. If you're more of a layman, it's an opportunity to read some science that shouldn't be too far over your head, most of the time. I fall in the latter category. I wouldn't exactly call this a light read (though it's certainly easier going than some books that I've attempted) but the personable tone and fascinating stories kept me interested even when the going got a little tough. For a more science literate reader, those same stories would probably make it easier to get through the more familiar territory without getting bored. So yes, I did have fun, and I learned a few things, and I gave my brain a bit of a workout. Which is exactly what I like to see in a book about science."
234,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,3,"Since I have ditched my chemical engineering degree for a (once shiny) computer science one, whenever I see books like these I tend to gravitate towards them in pure nostalgia and consume them with a single minded passion. This book especially incited fond memories from my college days when we were consuming chemistry and its historical progress. I still have my periodic table poster that hung next to my bed for a good part of last decade. It was fun to read anecdotes, vignettes and author's own dealings with elements. The writing is casual, occasionally whimsical, terribly nostalgic and overall interesting. Though Kean refrains from overt use of technical jargon, it just isn't possible to escape it completely. With a dose of nostalgia, I enjoyed reading this."
235,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5984690-sean-o,5,"One of the top non-fiction books I've read this year. It's full of exactly the kind of stories I like: scientists and other clever people finding out about the universe. This one is all about the Periodic Table of Elements, and stories about every single element. Some get star treatment, but even ultra-rare Francium gets a shout out. The science is good and the writer doesn't dumb things down too much. He also makes excellent use of foot notes which provide great asides as well as jumping off points for further reading. "
236,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999881-geoff,3,This book is filled with stories about the discoveries of the elements of the periodic table - some I knew and many I had never heard before. 
237,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"This is a relatively slim book, but it’s packed with super interesting stories you never learned in chemistry, like:1) Scientists tracked the path of Lewis & Clark across America by looking for mercury deposits. The party took mercury tablets to “cure” ailments, and wherever they went #2, they left mercury in the soil2) 7 different elements were discovered in Ytterby, a tiny suburban town in Sweden3) the elements in the periodic table haven’t always been around: originally, there was just hydrogen. Through a variety of reactions, hydrogen (the simplest element) produced all other elements on the periodic table in our solar system. (This makes me wonder: what do other solar systems look like, elementally? Did they experience the same reactions yielding the same elements, or an entirely different set?)4) the creator of the death gas used in WW2 concentration camps, Zyklon B (well, the first version anyway, named Zyklon A—it got slightly tweaked) was Franz Haber, a Jewish man famous for killing many Allied soldiers in painful chemical ways during WWI. Zyklon B was later used to murder thousands of people, including Haber’s own relatives5) Two elements called niobium and tantalum (named after Niobe and Tantalus from Greek myth) are found in the the Congo, combined in a rock called coltan. Niobium and tantalum are metals used in cell phones. The huge demand for coltan in the late 1990s/early 2000s caused anarchy and devastation in the Congo6) A scientist named Seaborg who worked on the Manhattan Project discovered the elements americium (which powers smoke detectors, by the way) and curium in 1946. Rather than announcing it in a scientific journal, Seaborg announced it on a children’s show, Quiz Kids (a child asked Seaborg if he’d discovered any new elements lately, and he explained that he had; judging by the mail he received from schoolchildren, teachers across the globe refused to believe the children’s claims the next week in school)7) the first antibacterial drug wasn’t penicillin (the first antibiotic)—in 1932, a man named Domagk discovered that Prontosil, an industrial dye, could be injected into a sick person to cure them of a bacterial infection (Domagk initially made this discovery on mice; when his daughter Hildegarde tripped while holding a sewing needle and acquired a life-threatening infection, Domagk gave it a whirl in humans, and she got better)8) Tellurium smells strongly of garlic. Beryllium tastes like sugar (despite being a toxic metal). Potassium tastes like salt!9) the European Union, appropriately, uses europium in the ink on euros to show they’re not counterfeit10) In the African nation of Gabon, there exists the only natural nuclear fission reactor known to exist, called Oklo—fueled by uranium, blue-green algae (pond scum), and plain water (the only reason there’s not a gigantic hole burned into Gabon? When the uranium reaches critical mass, it boils off the water, and without the water, the reaction stops). My favourite chapter was chapter 9 (on poisonous elements) because poison is cool. I was especially interested in how a local doctor (Noboru Hagino) discovered that cadmium was poisoning the people of Kamioka, Japan: with the help of a public health professor, he plotted the homes of all the people who came down with the mysterious disease (known as itai-itai, or “ouch ouch” disease), and was able to discover that they all lived along the Jinzu River, which carried cadmium, a waste product from the local mine. This reminded me a lot of The Ghost Map, which, as in the case of Kamioka, tells the story of how a local doctor and a public health professional teamed up to trace the root of a deadly disease (cholera, in that case) using mapping. (Speaking of London—I was also interested to see Alexander Litvinenko, murdered by polonium-spiked tea in a London sushi restaurant, get a mention; I recently saw his grave in Highgate Cemetery). Definitely a fun read if you have a spare afternoon and wish you knew the more fun side of chemistry."
238,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4053034-laura,1,"I didn't finish this book. I couldn't finish this book because the parts of this book that are about science I know could most generously be described as ""missleading at best"". If that's the case about the stuff I know, how much is true in the stuff I don't know? I'm called upon to teach some chemistry despite the fact my real chemistry knowledge pretty much ends at physical chemistry and astrochemistry - so I really don't need to fill my head with stories and theories that are pale reflections of the current state of knowledge when I don't read enough of the literature to judge how correct they are.I'm not sure where the author looked up the theory of solar system formation he gives in Chapter 4, but it wasn't in anything written in the last 20 years. If he'd turned in what's written here on an astronomy exam when I was in a generous mood I might give him a point or two for having a couple of right ideas in there, but he'd still have an F.I started to get a clue there was a problem when the author called the collision of comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 (1993 F2) with Jupiter ""intergalactic"". Huh? How is the collision of two solar system objects intergalactic? There's no evidence that SL9 was an extra-solar comet, much less an extra-galactic comet, but ok, he's using an odd hyperbole to make it sound more exciting. Overall the book has a very bubbly, casual style to it so I'll let him use this oddly chosen word. Things get worse however, when he implies Jupiter is the reason C/Hale-Bopp (1995 O1) came into the inner solar system. At this point I'm still assuming he knows that is not true and he's wording things really poorly, but I'm beginning to doubt I know enough of the science in other parts of the book to be able to see through this sort of thing elsewhere. However, it's when he writes ""Because the stellar wind blew only the lightest, most common elements as far out as Jupiter, it should have the same basic elemental composition as real stars"", that I pause and make a WTF!?! note in the margin. It takes me half a lecture or more to explain our current understanding of solar system formation, so I won't go through it all in this review, but the above is pure nonsense. More pure nonsense occurs when he mentions that the cloud of gas and dust our solar system formed out of was flat. There's no evidence for that and it's extremely unlikely dynamically. Simple physics flattens any shape of cloud collapsing under gravity to a spinning disk.Coming back to the missleading at best parts, we are told there are apparently mini-nuclear booms in stars counterbalancing gravity rather than thermal pressure. Booms implies a series of nuclear bombs going off when it is actually the steady rate of fusion in the interior of the Sun that causes the thermal pressure that balances gravity. Finally, given that I'm a planetary scientist, I just can't let slide the description of the Moon forming due to an ""asteroid or comet impact"". Well ok. If you want to call a roughly Mars sized planetesimal an asteroid or comet. However, there aren't any Mars sized planetesimals left that we'd call an asteroid or comet today. Mars is really in no danger of being demoted from planet-hood.I haven't picked on every problem with the astrophysics presented in this chapter, but all this and more brings me to the end of Chapter 4 with no trust the author knows anything about what he's talking about. This is likely not true given all the glowing reviews, one even appearing in the well respected journal Nature (I'm guessing a review by a chemist that knew no astronomy?). But having lost my trust it can't be regained, and I won't be finishing this book."
239,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9255064-melissa,4,"Chemistry has never been my thing. I hated it in high school (except for the part where we melted mechanical pencils over the Bunsen burner). Recently watching the chemistry Crash Course episodes has reminded me that chemistry is not just the boring science class I struggled to stay awake through in high school. Chemistry is everything around us and understanding a bit about it will help me better understand the way the world works.So I picked up The Disappearing Spoon with that in mind and was richly rewarded. Kean’s writing style was fun and made the subject matter interesting. He talks not only about the science behind each element, but about the scientists who discovered them and the impact they had on the world. For example Mendeleev, who is credited with creating the Periodic Table, had a fascinating start. He was born in Siberia, the youngest of 11 children. His father died when he was only 13 and his mother worked incredibly hard to give him the chance to go to school. Imagine having to overcome all of those things just to be able to go to school! Another favorite of mine was Marie Curie. Her fascinating life, including a marriage that was far ahead of its time and the discovery of multiple elements was so interesting. She won a Nobel Prize in a time when women in America weren’t even allowed to vote. I would love to a biography that focused solely on her.The periodic table has changed the world in both positive and negative ways. Kean doesn’t shy away from the damage that’s been done because of the discovery of a new element. He talks about the effects of vaccinations and medicines and also at the way chemistry made things like the atom bomb possible. When cell phones became wildly popular in the 1990s the fight to find more of the metal used to create them caused the Congo to explode with fighting. People were in a frenzy to provide the metal that was in such high demand. “Overall more than 5 million people have died in Congo since the mid-1990s, making it the biggest waste of life since World War II. The fighting there is proof that in addition to all the uplifting moments the Periodic table has inspired it can also play on humankind's worst, most inhumane instincts.”This balanced look at the Table reminds us that with great knowledge (just like great power) comes great responsibility. Almost any scientific advance can be used for good or bad and there will always be a struggle to use it correctly. BOTTOM LINE: The most interesting book I’ve read ever read about chemistry and one that kept me intrigued the entire time. We live in a truly remarkable world and I’ll never regret reading a book that opens up a new corner of that world to me."
240,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/981514-minli,4,"Entertaining read--and a fascinating subject matter. I'm definitely the right audience for this book: someone who knows some chemistry but didn't get any higher degrees in it, and is more interested in the historical, cultural building of the periodic table than the hard science.Kean's wry prose never lets you forget that his point of view is subjective and conversational: he paints caricatures of famous scientists and makes ridiculous analogies. His audience is undoubtedly American. He does his best to explain concepts (some of which I still remembered!) in layman's terms, though I kind of dozed off at the discussion of alpha. He does a good job giving awesome lady scientists their due, like Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin, Maria Groppert-Mayer and Marie Curie. I learned a bunch of things, how thallium is the worst ever poison (the poisoner's poison) and that cobalt-60 is the dirtiest and worst ever a-bomb. The structuring of the elements grouped into chapters, chapters grouped into parts, gave the book a flow and rhythm. It might have benefited from a longer conclusion.This book has made me feel like the biggest dork ever, because when people mention some element now, I have to squash the impulse to say, ""Hey! Did you know that...""The Disappearing Spoon also showed to me what my chemistry, biology and physics teachers in high school and college never did: how magical, weird, wonderful, temperamental, dangerous and dramatic science can be, how they're heterogeneously mixed with Romance and politics. I wish I'd had this book in high school."
241,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19832185-thomas-frank,4,"As someone who never took chemistry, I found this book to provide just enough of the basics about the periodic table to enable me to sound at least a bit better than completely ignorant when talking about the subject. Beyond that, it's filled with interesting stories about the people who helped build the table and discover many of its elements, as well as other events that revolve around said elements. I particularly enjoyed the one about Germany's clandestine operations in the U.S. during WWI.One nitpick I had with this book: Every 2-3 pages, you'll find an asterisk that corresponds to a footnote in the back of the book. I'm the kind of person who simply cannot ignore these, and as a result, constantly going to the back of the book to read them made it a bit harder for me to immerse myself in the main text. Now, this is mainly the fault of my own brain, so I'm not subtracting anything from my score for it. Just be aware of this fact if you happen to be like me. Personally, I think the footnotes would have been less distracting if they were put on the actual page where they were referenced.Still, this book was really enjoyable. I look forward to digging into Kean's newer works when I've got some time."

Subtitle: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the ElementsWho could have imagined such a volume written about that chart that hangs in every high school chemistry classroom? I’m an admitted science geek. I loved the “Mr Wizard” TV show when I was a kid. (He encouraged us to perform all sorts of experiments using our mother’s kitchen utensils and supplies.) I never wanted a Barbie doll, I wanted a chemistry set and a microscope! So, I’ve had this book on my TBR list since it first came out. And I have to say that I’m a little disappointed.It’s not that Kean is a bad writer; he isn’t, and he’s quite thorough in exploring this topic. His enthusiasm and fascination for the periodic table comes through. But, it was just too much even for this science geek. Some parts were far more interesting to me than others. I loved the chapter on poisons, for example. I was less enthralled with the political infighting on what name to give to a newly discovered element. Also, I made the choice to listen to the audio format. Sean Runnette did a fine job of performing the audio. However, the sometimes dry subject matter made for a more difficult listening experience. I might have enjoyed this more in text."
243,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3349963-craig-cottingham,4,"I was a chemical engineering major in college, so some of the background information (like the basics of the periodic table) was familiar to me and therefore a little tedious to read. Outside of that, however, this was a fascinating book that I think would be accessible to non-beakerheads.Each chapter is devoted to a group of elements that are related. Instead of going for the obvious groupings (the inert gasses, the halogens, etc.) he comes at them from a refreshingly sideways direction. There's a chapter on poisons (from the obvious like arsenic, to thallium, which was responsible for thousands of deaths from contaminated groundwater in Japan) and another on measurements (from the international standard kilogram, which is an ingot of iridium, to the cesium-powered atomic clocks which define the international standard second). Each one reads a little like an episode of James Burke's TV series Connections, the way the discussion of one element blends into another. Sometimes the connections and the groupings are a little contrived, but not jarringly so, and I'm sure it was necessary to avoid a ""here are all the elements that didn't fit in anywhere else"" chapter.Highly recommended."
244,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"There’s a lot packed into this book. I enjoyed the look of the history of the periodic table; how it got started, the changes made over time, the discoveries of elements. Intermingled are the stories of the people; the scientists who figured things out and made things happen. Intertwined yet again are the stories of the theory and workings of atoms; what makes them tick, what makes them unique, what makes them react. Then there’s all those scientists; some humorous, some deceitful or crazy for fame. I really enjoyed the bit about the periodic table in the future and how the table if ever-changing and expanding. This is a wonderful book for those who enjoy chemistry, physics and anything “earthy”. "
245,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Fun romp through the periodic table - lots of chemistry and physics, but even more stories about science and the people who do it. Sam Kean has fun with history. The book is not very technical, but approachable and occasionally humorous. The stories are diverse - there are many elements on the table, so we jump around quite a bit. I enjoyed this on audio, found it both educational and entertaining, but I probably won’t remember much as there is no common storyline other than the stories being about elements."
246,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,2,"Uneven and only fitfully engaging, The Disappearing Spoon is less a history of the periodic table and how scientists have come to understand elemental matter than it is a collection of facts about those elements and anecdotes about the various researchers who've discovered them. Sam Kean doesn't really have the knack for explaining (or re-explaining) scientific concepts to people who haven't studied chemistry or physics since secondary school, and relies too much on clunky metaphors and irritating anthropomorphisms. (For example, Kean writes that stars are ""[d]esperate to maintain high temperatures."" Stars are not sentient. They do not have feelings. Even more jaw-droppingly asinine, though, are sentences like ""In addition to Haber's being a Jew, Germany excommunicated him because he had become passé."" Do I need to break down why this is, at an absolute minimum, a tacky way of putting things?) He never actually fully explains how the periodic table works.More damningly to me, as a historian, is that Kean tries to write from a perspective which is determinedly presentist. His interest in the past seems to primarily stem from wanting to know the backstory of the discovery and refinement of certain scientific concepts, rather than any desire to engage with the history of science as an evolving conceptual system which is inevitably shaped by those who practice it. For a man who seems fascinated by the universe on scales both macro and micro, Kean seems profoundly uninterested in the human."
247,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"What Neil DeGrasse Tyson does for astronomy and David Attenborough does for zoology, Sam Kean does for chemistry and physics TOGETHER. There were a few times when the author simplified technical explanations, which I think made it more confusing. For that reason, I almost gave this book a 4. However there were enough moments where my mind was completely blown that I decided it had to be a 5. The first chapter is boring, but it is well worth pushing through. (What is it with science and very boring first chapters. Always. Start with something that draws me in for cryin' out loud!) There is a fascinating chapter on elements in times of war (Gold? Who needs gold? Give me molybdenum and tungsten.) and of course causing wars. A chapter that delves into lasers and masers (Holy shit, this was awesome! Seriously? How did I not know how lasers work? How did I learn all of the basic principles in physics, but I never learned how they come together in the most fantastic, brilliant way? I am happy to have rectified this situation.) and also the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a newish state of matter where a few thousand atoms becomes ""one giant marshmallow"" of an atom-a singularity and on a macro scale. This chapter ends with:""As technology keeps improving, scientists have gotten better and better at inducing matter to form the BEC. It's not like anyone's taking orders yet, but scientists might soon be able to build 'matter lasers' that shoot out ultra-focused beams of atoms thousands of times more powerful that light lasers, or construct 'supersolid' ice cubes that CAN FLOW THROUGH EACH OTHER WITHOUT LOSING THEIR SOLIDITY [emphasis mine]."" If I were a science teacher, the very next thing I would do after teaching this is have my students write a sci-fi story touching on where this technology is going next. What's it like to live in a world where solids can flow through each other? I know it's impossibly silly, but I immediately imagined humans that can walk through walls and stuff like that. Of course, this only happens at way below zero temperatures and on a very small scale. But you know, a girl can dream. There's also a chapter called ""Poisoner's Corridor: 'Ouch-Ouch'."" No need to elaborate. There's a chapter on elements as currency and of course fraud. There's even a section on how elements deceive our sense of taste-fascinating! (An example- chewing potassium gymnemate will make raw sugar heaped on your tongue taste like sand)Some other awesome tidbits:The person who discovered x-rays thought he went mad when he first saw the bones of his hands and a key hidden in a book. ""The primary component of taste, smell, is the only sense that bypasses our logical neural processing and connects directly to the brain's emotional centers.""""And whereas electrons absorb and emit light of the same color (yellow in, yellow out), fluorescent molecules absorb high-energy light (ultraviolet light) but emit that energy as lower-energy, visible light."" That's why we can see scorpions glow in the dark under black lights! This is what makes UV visible to us! The most powerful lasers today can produce beams that for a fraction of a second produce more power than the whole United States.Seriously, this book goes all over the place, but still manages to be organized. Loved it! "
248,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie,3,"""The Disappearing Spoon"" teaches the chemistry and physics of atoms and the periodic table. It's taught primarily in the context of short biographies about the Noble prize winning scientists (plus some others) who discovered the various elements or who discovered important things about how the elements or atoms are put together.Based on the book description I was given, I was expecting more trivia about the elements and how they are and have been used rather than a book teaching science with a main focus on scientists. However, the author's casual, lively, and sometimes crude tone made the stories entertaining--probably even more so to young males than to me. I did get a little tired of the author's judgmental attitude, though. It seemed like every human action had to be either brilliant or insanely stupid.The author's explanations of how things worked (atoms, periodic table, etc.) were easy for me to follow, but that might partly be because I took a lot of science courses in college. The initial science lessons were high school level, but the ending lessons were more college level (though high schoolers can probably follow them).The book primarily focused on science and scientists, but there were a few stories of invention, greed, destruction or just plain weirdness based around non-scientists. Though I didn't actually check to make sure, it seemed like every element on the periodic table was covered at least briefly. Some of the areas in which he discussed the use of the elements were warfare (chemical warfare, nuclear bombs, dirty bombs), medicine, politics, art, biology (especially DNA), as poison, as money (counterfeiting, a strange gold rush), and under super-cool conditions. He also covered a Big Bang model of how the elements were formed (with a ""see, no god needed!"" emphasis), how radiometric dating methods were thought up and used to generate dates for the age of the Earth that were old enough to give biological evolution a chance of occurring (since previous dating methods gave too ""young"" of an age to allow for it), and how biases can prevent critical viewing of scientific data (though he didn't seem to notice his own bias).He worked a lot of ""there is no God, humans & Earth aren't special, and evolution is true"" apologetics into this book. I wouldn't mind so much if, in the appendix, he hadn't presented what ""young-earth creationists believe"" by mixing true statements with misrepresented and apparently ridiculous ones as well as completely inaccurate ones. So now, if these readers come across the true argument, they'll dismiss it without really considering it--they'll think they know all about it when they don't.There were a few black and white photographs of scientists and a few charts. Overall, the book was entertaining and interesting, though not so much so that I'd want to read it again. The people who'd be most interested by it are probably teen or college age males who idolize science as pure and untarnished but who also like somewhat scandalous tales about scientists, their competitions to make Noble-winning discoveries, and their fights over who made a discovery first.I received this Advanced Reader Copy for review purposes from the publisher. "
249,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author relates many anecdotes of the discovery and uses of several elements with (as he says about those who know the periodic table) ""dweeby nonchalance.” It is meant to be a readable, interesting book of popular science for the lay reader, and indeed it is full of fascinating anecdotes about all things elemental. (The titular spoon is made of gallium, metal that melts in low temperatures and therefore a spoon made of it dissolves in tea. Ha ha, periodic table practical jokes!) Based on the title alone, I expected a lot of anecdotes such as the battle over the molybdenum mine in Colorado during WWII to help the Nazi war effort, or endless spats over naming rights of elements, but this book contains so much more. The madman Fritz Haber and his chlorine gas experiments; how the niobium in your cell phone helped finance the brutal Congo wars; an overview of the Bose-Einstein Condensate, the fifth state of matter; Henry Moseley’s electron beam; the alpha constant; why silicon-based life forms are extremely unlikely; Cobalt 60 dirty bombs; Monte Carlo science, itai-itai disease caused by Cadmium poisoning from mining companies on Japan; the role of gadolinium in MRI machines and cancer fighting; the left or right ""handedness"" of proteins; sulfur bacteria and how it relates to the sense of taste; the longest ""word"" ever, a technical term that is too long to be written; why we can unknowingly breathe in nitrogen without gasping for air until we suddenly collapse and die; why idolaters of Gandhi dislike iodine; how a lack of salt in a person suggests the nonexistence of the soul; how brass might be the nugget of truth behind the King Midas myth; how the science of bubbles led to the discovery of radon; and more. As you can see, the scope of this work is vast, possibly too much so. While it is written in a personable, conversational style, I felt that Kean doesn't manage to convey to the meanest scientific intelligence (namely me) a full understanding of the science he uses in the book, such as the aforementioned alpha constant, or how exactly electrons move from their ""shells."" Such information isn't necessary to appreciate the scientific history here, so for me it would have been better off cut entirely if impossible to simplify. I don't need the technical details to approve of a book that tells us that Lewis and Clark's route can be traced by the trace mercury in their feces, or refers to a Mark Twain story in which Satan is depicted as being made of radium, or that Paul McCartney was awarded a rhodium record (rather than gold or platinum) for his unsurpassed sales. That's the stuff that keeps the lay reader in their seats."
250,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Sam Kean has written a witty, interesting book about the elements in the Periodic Table. He writes as if he was chatting with the reader in a coffee shop or a tavern, regaling his friends with one anecdote after another. He's imparting his knowledge of science by the use of quirky, fun facts and interesting stories about the scientists involved.This is not set up like a typical chemistry textbook. The chapters are divided into areas of interest such as astronomy, poisons, money, war, medicine, and periods of history. The author is a physicist so the book had a lot of information about elements made in the lab, radioactive elements, nuclear chemistry, and the atomic bomb. For me, that was the most challenging part of the book.He writes about Linus Pauling's theory of a triple helix being trumped by James Watson and Francis Crick's double helix model of DNA. The attractive Marie Curie was a source of gossip when she took men into dark closets to show them radioactive specimens. Ghandhi told the people of India to dry their own salt instead of paying a British salt tax, only to have many people develop goiter due to lack of iodine. The trail taken by Lewis and Clark is known because anthropologists found (poisonous) mercury capsules that the explorers were using as laxatives. These types of stories make science seem more approachable.The title of the book comes from a practical joke. Gallium, which resembles aluminum, is a solid below 84 degrees F, and can be molded into a spoon. When it is dipped into hot tea, the surprised guest finds the spoon disappearing as it melts away. (Youtube has some ""disappearing spoon"" videos.)This is a book that can be enjoyed by the lay person as well as a scientist. Some chapters will be much easier to understand if a reader has had an introduction to the Periodic Table, such as in a high school Chemistry course. I would have preferred having the footnotes on the bottom of the pages rather than in the back of the book. Overall, the author should be commended for making science fun."
251,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3096541-amy,4,"I have to confess I didn't pay much attention to chemistry. Once the instructor talked about electrons, protons, atoms and the nucleus I usually turned on my Walkman (the cassette kind, now antique!). It never seemed interesting because it wasn't something that related at all to real life. If I had a teacher like Sam Kean, however, that could have been different.Fast forward too many years, and now I'm engrossed in this nonfiction 'memoir' of the Periodic Table of Elements. Like any good biography, this has scandal, lies, fraud, madness, explosions (!!!) and lots of name-dropping. Kean explains just what the periodic table is, but in a format that reads more like a novel, with anecdotal details to liven it up. Mercury pills were used by Lewis and Clark for their health? Yep, and you can trace their path (um, at least their bathroom trips on their journey) by where scientists have found unusually high amounts of mercury in the soil. The poet Robert Lowell? Did lithium ruin his work by making him sane? Who knew the lies and fraud and mind games played by scientists intent on getting a Nobel Prize! There's no getting around it, this is a book that makes you think. It's not simple and it assumes you have a basic knowledge of science. Some areas were over my head, but not for long. Kean is a wonderful teacher with a sassy wise guy voice that livens up any of the deeper areas."
252,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47354-dave,4,"For me this book was a pleasure to listen to. I plan to read a paper or e-book edition shortly. A delightful, an engaging blend of lyrical prose, historic anecdotes and fascinating information. Reminiscent, to me, of some of the writing of Lewis Thomas, Oliver Sacks, Barry Lopez, Edward Abbey and John McPhee.Brain/mind candy or chicken soup for the nerd's soul. Does that make me a dualist?The chapter essays are wide ranging anecdotal expositions of elements and families of elements. Not only stories about the scientists who prospected for and predicted the existence of certain elements, and created schemata for organizing them but about the influence of various elements on cultures, politics, economics and even philosophy. The stories added greatly to my appreciation for and understanding of the lives and work of some well known and some no longer famous scientists. The meditations on peculiar properties of some groups of atoms and alternative arrangements for the Periodic Table bumped my rating of the book from between 4 and 5 stars to clearly 5 stars. Others not so smitten on the history of science and mathematics may find it only mildly interesting or even boring. A must read for nerds, history buffs and fans of creative non-fiction. "
253,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2968341-linda-isakson,5,"I don't normally review non-fiction reads, but this one is just too superb to pass up! A wonderful and engaging read from cover-to-cover. Sam Kean takes the periodic table of the elements, a chart that makes most people cringe at thoughts of high school (or college) chemistry, and turns it into a riveting drama about the table's origins and the hunt to find new elements. Science geeks will love the scientific jargon but you don't need a degree in chemistry to understand the fascinating stories behind the revolutionaries responsible for our modern day technologies. This is definitely a book you can read over and over and still find little morsels you might have previously missed. Kean is amusing, insightful and presents complex information in a very understable package. A must read for fans of scientific history."
254,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18206572-inken,4,"I really enjoyed this book – even the parts I couldn’t understand. I so wish we’d had this as a set text when I took chemistry in high school. Not only might I have understood the rubbish our teacher was spouting, I might’ve liked it and even passed the bloody thing! Nobody ever even bothered to explain the Periodic Table to us and why it looks the way it does. And it's true: watching a gallium spoon dissolve in a glass of water is pretty cool.I had no idea the world of chemistry and physics was such a hotbed of rivalry, gossip and scandal. Delicious stuff."
255,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80835-celeste-ng,0,"Fascinating to me as the daughter of a chemist--I grew up with periodic tables all around, quite literally (I had a periodic table placemat!). Some of these stories were familiar to me, but most were new. Highly recommended for those who want to why the periodic table matters, and to know more about how the elements have changed human lives, sometimes drastically."
256,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40823165-yibbie,1," Never would I have assumed that I would have to quit reading a book about chemistry because of a lewd scene, but I did. In his attempt to introduce us to different chemicals and explain their lives, the author personifies them as characters in a smutty romance. So I quit what was up till then, an interesting book. "
257,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,5,"I’ve been reading a lot of non-fiction lately, and for me, that’s really...well, unusual. If you had asked me a couple of years ago how I felt about non-fiction, I would have described it as eye-glazingly dull, a dry recitation of facts. But now I eagerly scour the non-fiction shelves at the library. I know -- it’s crazy!The only explanation is that non-fiction has gotten better. (It can’t be me that’s changed.) The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean is a fine example of this better, more interesting non-fiction. Kean doesn’t skimp on the facts. He’s packed his book with oodles of information about the elements. What saves his book from being merely a mind-numbing collection of elemental characteristics may be gleaned from the book’s full title: The Disappearing Spoon and Other Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of Elements.Yes, it’s the madness and weirdness that brings the elements to life, and Kean seems to have dug up a fascinating story for virtually every element on the periodic table. For example, the title’s disappearing spoon refers to a (nerdy) practical joke in which unsuspecting victims are given a gallium spoon to stir their tea. I was particularly interested in the stories surrounding the radioactive elements, which ranged from an ex-KGB spy that was murdered with polonium-laced sushi in 2006 to a boy scout that tried to build his own nuclear reactor.Reading non-fiction like this is not only painless, but fun, and I’m convinced that I’m retaining all of those pesky little facts better that I normally would because I’ve so enjoyed learning them. Just wait until we meet at the next dinner party and I regale you with tales of elemental hijinks. If you’ve long despaired of enjoying non-fiction, perhaps now is the time to give it another try. "
258,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,4,"I pretty much knew I was going to like this book as soon as I heard about it. I mean, come on, it's about science! Some of the factoids I learned in this book will stick with me for a long time, like the naturally occurring nuclear reactor in Africa, or the reason why the Washington monument is capped with aluminum. At first I was disappointed that the book had end notes instead of footnotes. I do like footnotes. However, many of them were so long that I understood the reason for it. I ended up just having two bookmarks, one for where I was in the book, and one for where I was in the end notes.On one hand, there were sections that I feel I would have liked better if it hadn't been so long since my last chemistry class. On the other hand, if I were more well-versed in chemistry, some of the stories wouldn't have been so new and interesting to me.There were one or two slow sections in this book, but the interesting sections more than balanced it out. More to the point, this was a book that made me feel smarter for having read it--that goes a long way.One minor quibble that bothered me is that while there were two blank periodic tables which I found quickly, the actual periodic table in the book comes so close to the end that I wasn't able to find it, and I was looking for one. I would have liked to have one to reference. By the time I found it, I was almost done with the book and didn't need it as much. If the periodic table had been printed as an end paper, or in the beginning, or even at the start of the end notes where I could have found it, that would have made it easier to understand some of what the author talked about. After all, it's been a while since high school chemistry, and I only look at that chart periodically. (ha ha)"
259,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1951489-amanda,4,"Think back to your high school chemistry class. Chances are, the artwork adorning the classroom probably contained a poster with the periodic table of the elements. For some reason, all through 7 chemistry classes, my favorite was tungsten.Pop quiz - what is the chemical symbol for tungsten? Why, ""W"" of course! Why not T or Tu or Tg?? The ""W""is for wolfram, the German name for tungsten. Without it, those handy incandescent lightbulbs would not operate if it weren't for those tungsten filaments.I've always had a soft spot for science trivia, and the periodic table of the elements is full of interesting stories. If you have the same soft spot, I'd recommend ""The Disappearing Spoon"" by Sam Keane. The title references a property of the element gallium. Gallium turns from a solid to a liquid at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the author, a favorite prank of grad students is to fashion spoons made of gallium and to hand them out with tea or coffee. The spoon looks like the metal of other silverware, but when used in tea or coffee, melts away - a disappearing spoon!Another reason this is a great book is that it humanizes many of the famous scientists. In reading through textbooks, you never see into the personal lives or professional struggles of the discoveries and constants described in the text. Yet in The Disappearing Spoon, you see the races to get published (discovering and naming rights to elements), the discouragement at being passed up for a Nobel Prize yet again, and how wars and politics shape the or stunt technology."

I went to Barnes & Noble the other day with the wife, ostensibly to get a cup of coffee, and picked up this book and Jose Saramago's 'The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'. I couldn't tell you what it was about it that caught my attention. I'm doing that thing again where I read too many books at once, but despite my inward pleas to the contrary, I couldn't resist picking it up and starting to read. What a great book. Refreshing, endlessly intriguing. Every page was a pleasure. Basically a book like this tells me two things: what a whiny spoiled brat I am, and what a complete dimwitted ape I am. In these pages I read about a woman who rode horseback for 1200 miles through a Russian winter to get her kid to a college only to see him rejected, and she then rode 400 more miles to get him to yet another school after which she promptly, and understandably, died. That's just so Russian. Then I read about a man who not only invented the Bunsen burner, he also invented the Spectrometer, and subsequently discovered several new elements, all in the 1850s. I look at myself and realize I'm liable to get suicidal if we run out of half and half, and my greatest achievement in life has been to arrange The Police's 'Roxanne' for the ukulele. Sometimes a good dose of perspective is extremely illuminating. "

Then The Disappearing Spoon might be the book for you.This book is exactly what it is made out to be. With a full title of The Disappearing Spoon And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, it tells you everything you should know. Kean starts with the periodic table, talks about how it was created, and from there, tells of fun, tragic, or interesting stories about all of the elements.Most of the science in The Disappearing Spoon is understandable with a high-school knowledge of chemistry. But even if you don't know enough chemistry, those parts can easily be skipped. Most of the book is heavily inspired by scientific history, rather than science itself. If you want to know more about the bickering and rivalries between chemists, this book is perfect. The Disappearing Spoon is highly entertaining, and it's clear the author has done extensive research into the lives of the scientists he talks about. My only gripe is that he has the tendency to lose direction sometimes, and flounders between all of the threads of stories he started, no longer clear on exactly what point he wanted to make. "

This is at times a ""cute book"" but in spite of it's promise it will help you if you have a deep abiding love of chemistry before you crack it open.It doesn't really appear to be organized all that well and isn't truly geared to the average reader. He opens up with his early fascination with mercury (the element, not the planet or the mythological deity) and how it led him into literature etc. Then he sets out to induce us all into the wonder/wonders that is/are the periodic table. I wasn't drawn into chemistry beyond what's required in high school, neither was I here. It didn't work, I lost interest quickly and wasn't interested in going on with the class.Enjoy if it's cup of tea...not mine. Maybe you'll like it, but I can't recommend it."

If you're a full-fledged science geek, this could be a relatively light side read. If you're more of a layman, it's an opportunity to read some science that shouldn't be too far over your head, most of the time. I fall in the latter category. I wouldn't exactly call this a light read (though it's certainly easier going than some books that I've attempted) but the personable tone and fascinating stories kept me interested even when the going got a little tough. For a more science literate reader, those same stories would probably make it easier to get through the more familiar territory without getting bored. So yes, I did have fun, and I learned a few things, and I gave my brain a bit of a workout. Which is exactly what I like to see in a book about science."

This book especially incited fond memories from my college days when we were consuming chemistry and its historical progress. I still have my periodic table poster that hung next to my bed for a good part of last decade. It was fun to read anecdotes, vignettes and author's own dealings with elements. The writing is casual, occasionally whimsical, terribly nostalgic and overall interesting. Though Kean refrains from overt use of technical jargon, it just isn't possible to escape it completely. With a dose of nostalgia, I enjoyed reading this."

It's full of exactly the kind of stories I like: scientists and other clever people finding out about the universe. This one is all about the Periodic Table of Elements, and stories about every single element. Some get star treatment, but even ultra-rare Francium gets a shout out. The science is good and the writer doesn't dumb things down too much. He also makes excellent use of foot notes which provide great asides as well as jumping off points for further reading. "

The party took mercury tablets to “cure” ailments, and wherever they went #2, they left mercury in the soil2) 7 different elements were discovered in Ytterby, a tiny suburban town in Sweden3) the elements in the periodic table haven’t always been around: originally, there was just hydrogen. Through a variety of reactions, hydrogen (the simplest element) produced all other elements on the periodic table in our solar system. (This makes me wonder: what do other solar systems look like, elementally? Did they experience the same reactions yielding the same elements, or an entirely different set?)4) the creator of the death gas used in WW2 concentration camps, Zyklon B (well, the first version anyway, named Zyklon A—it got slightly tweaked) was Franz Haber, a Jewish man famous for killing many Allied soldiers in painful chemical ways during WWI. Zyklon B was later used to murder thousands of people, including Haber’s own relatives5) Two elements called niobium and tantalum (named after Niobe and Tantalus from Greek myth) are found in the the Congo, combined in a rock called coltan. Niobium and tantalum are metals used in cell phones. The huge demand for coltan in the late 1990s/early 2000s caused anarchy and devastation in the Congo6) A scientist named Seaborg who worked on the Manhattan Project discovered the elements americium (which powers smoke detectors, by the way) and curium in 1946. Rather than announcing it in a scientific journal, Seaborg announced it on a children’s show, Quiz Kids (a child asked Seaborg if he’d discovered any new elements lately, and he explained that he had; judging by the mail he received from schoolchildren, teachers across the globe refused to believe the children’s claims the next week in school)7) the first antibacterial drug wasn’t penicillin (the first antibiotic)—in 1932, a man named Domagk discovered that Prontosil, an industrial dye, could be injected into a sick person to cure them of a bacterial infection (Domagk initially made this discovery on mice; when his daughter Hildegarde tripped while holding a sewing needle and acquired a life-threatening infection, Domagk gave it a whirl in humans, and she got better)8) Tellurium smells strongly of garlic. Beryllium tastes like sugar (despite being a toxic metal). Potassium tastes like salt!9) the European Union, appropriately, uses europium in the ink on euros to show they’re not counterfeit10) In the African nation of Gabon, there exists the only natural nuclear fission reactor known to exist, called Oklo—fueled by uranium, blue-green algae (pond scum), and plain water (the only reason there’s not a gigantic hole burned into Gabon? When the uranium reaches critical mass, it boils off the water, and without the water, the reaction stops). My favourite chapter was chapter 9 (on poisonous elements) because poison is cool. I was especially interested in how a local doctor (Noboru Hagino) discovered that cadmium was poisoning the people of Kamioka, Japan: with the help of a public health professor, he plotted the homes of all the people who came down with the mysterious disease (known as itai-itai, or “ouch ouch” disease), and was able to discover that they all lived along the Jinzu River, which carried cadmium, a waste product from the local mine. This reminded me a lot of The Ghost Map, which, as in the case of Kamioka, tells the story of how a local doctor and a public health professional teamed up to trace the root of a deadly disease (cholera, in that case) using mapping. (Speaking of London—I was also interested to see Alexander Litvinenko, murdered by polonium-spiked tea in a London sushi restaurant, get a mention; I recently saw his grave in Highgate Cemetery). Definitely a fun read if you have a spare afternoon and wish you knew the more fun side of chemistry."
268,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4053034-laura,1,"I didn't finish this book. I couldn't finish this book because the parts of this book that are about science I know could most generously be described as ""missleading at best"". If that's the case about the stuff I know, how much is true in the stuff I don't know? I'm called upon to teach some chemistry despite the fact my real chemistry knowledge pretty much ends at physical chemistry and astrochemistry - so I really don't need to fill my head with stories and theories that are pale reflections of the current state of knowledge when I don't read enough of the literature to judge how correct they are.I'm not sure where the author looked up the theory of solar system formation he gives in Chapter 4, but it wasn't in anything written in the last 20 years. If he'd turned in what's written here on an astronomy exam when I was in a generous mood I might give him a point or two for having a couple of right ideas in there, but he'd still have an F.I started to get a clue there was a problem when the author called the collision of comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 (1993 F2) with Jupiter ""intergalactic"". Huh? How is the collision of two solar system objects intergalactic? There's no evidence that SL9 was an extra-solar comet, much less an extra-galactic comet, but ok, he's using an odd hyperbole to make it sound more exciting. Overall the book has a very bubbly, casual style to it so I'll let him use this oddly chosen word. Things get worse however, when he implies Jupiter is the reason C/Hale-Bopp (1995 O1) came into the inner solar system. At this point I'm still assuming he knows that is not true and he's wording things really poorly, but I'm beginning to doubt I know enough of the science in other parts of the book to be able to see through this sort of thing elsewhere. However, it's when he writes ""Because the stellar wind blew only the lightest, most common elements as far out as Jupiter, it should have the same basic elemental composition as real stars"", that I pause and make a WTF!?! note in the margin. It takes me half a lecture or more to explain our current understanding of solar system formation, so I won't go through it all in this review, but the above is pure nonsense. More pure nonsense occurs when he mentions that the cloud of gas and dust our solar system formed out of was flat. There's no evidence for that and it's extremely unlikely dynamically. Simple physics flattens any shape of cloud collapsing under gravity to a spinning disk.Coming back to the missleading at best parts, we are told there are apparently mini-nuclear booms in stars counterbalancing gravity rather than thermal pressure. Booms implies a series of nuclear bombs going off when it is actually the steady rate of fusion in the interior of the Sun that causes the thermal pressure that balances gravity. Finally, given that I'm a planetary scientist, I just can't let slide the description of the Moon forming due to an ""asteroid or comet impact"". Well ok. If you want to call a roughly Mars sized planetesimal an asteroid or comet. However, there aren't any Mars sized planetesimals left that we'd call an asteroid or comet today. Mars is really in no danger of being demoted from planet-hood.I haven't picked on every problem with the astrophysics presented in this chapter, but all this and more brings me to the end of Chapter 4 with no trust the author knows anything about what he's talking about. This is likely not true given all the glowing reviews, one even appearing in the well respected journal Nature (I'm guessing a review by a chemist that knew no astronomy?). But having lost my trust it can't be regained, and I won't be finishing this book."
269,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9255064-melissa,4,"Chemistry has never been my thing. I hated it in high school (except for the part where we melted mechanical pencils over the Bunsen burner). Recently watching the chemistry Crash Course episodes has reminded me that chemistry is not just the boring science class I struggled to stay awake through in high school. Chemistry is everything around us and understanding a bit about it will help me better understand the way the world works.So I picked up The Disappearing Spoon with that in mind and was richly rewarded. Kean’s writing style was fun and made the subject matter interesting. He talks not only about the science behind each element, but about the scientists who discovered them and the impact they had on the world. For example Mendeleev, who is credited with creating the Periodic Table, had a fascinating start. He was born in Siberia, the youngest of 11 children. His father died when he was only 13 and his mother worked incredibly hard to give him the chance to go to school. Imagine having to overcome all of those things just to be able to go to school! Another favorite of mine was Marie Curie. Her fascinating life, including a marriage that was far ahead of its time and the discovery of multiple elements was so interesting. She won a Nobel Prize in a time when women in America weren’t even allowed to vote. I would love to a biography that focused solely on her.The periodic table has changed the world in both positive and negative ways. Kean doesn’t shy away from the damage that’s been done because of the discovery of a new element. He talks about the effects of vaccinations and medicines and also at the way chemistry made things like the atom bomb possible. When cell phones became wildly popular in the 1990s the fight to find more of the metal used to create them caused the Congo to explode with fighting. People were in a frenzy to provide the metal that was in such high demand. “Overall more than 5 million people have died in Congo since the mid-1990s, making it the biggest waste of life since World War II. The fighting there is proof that in addition to all the uplifting moments the Periodic table has inspired it can also play on humankind's worst, most inhumane instincts.”This balanced look at the Table reminds us that with great knowledge (just like great power) comes great responsibility. Almost any scientific advance can be used for good or bad and there will always be a struggle to use it correctly. BOTTOM LINE: The most interesting book I’ve read ever read about chemistry and one that kept me intrigued the entire time. We live in a truly remarkable world and I’ll never regret reading a book that opens up a new corner of that world to me."
270,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/981514-minli,4,"Entertaining read--and a fascinating subject matter. I'm definitely the right audience for this book: someone who knows some chemistry but didn't get any higher degrees in it, and is more interested in the historical, cultural building of the periodic table than the hard science.Kean's wry prose never lets you forget that his point of view is subjective and conversational: he paints caricatures of famous scientists and makes ridiculous analogies. His audience is undoubtedly American. He does his best to explain concepts (some of which I still remembered!) in layman's terms, though I kind of dozed off at the discussion of alpha. He does a good job giving awesome lady scientists their due, like Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin, Maria Groppert-Mayer and Marie Curie. I learned a bunch of things, how thallium is the worst ever poison (the poisoner's poison) and that cobalt-60 is the dirtiest and worst ever a-bomb. The structuring of the elements grouped into chapters, chapters grouped into parts, gave the book a flow and rhythm. It might have benefited from a longer conclusion.This book has made me feel like the biggest dork ever, because when people mention some element now, I have to squash the impulse to say, ""Hey! Did you know that...""The Disappearing Spoon also showed to me what my chemistry, biology and physics teachers in high school and college never did: how magical, weird, wonderful, temperamental, dangerous and dramatic science can be, how they're heterogeneously mixed with Romance and politics. I wish I'd had this book in high school."
271,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19832185-thomas-frank,4,"As someone who never took chemistry, I found this book to provide just enough of the basics about the periodic table to enable me to sound at least a bit better than completely ignorant when talking about the subject. Beyond that, it's filled with interesting stories about the people who helped build the table and discover many of its elements, as well as other events that revolve around said elements. I particularly enjoyed the one about Germany's clandestine operations in the U.S. during WWI.One nitpick I had with this book: Every 2-3 pages, you'll find an asterisk that corresponds to a footnote in the back of the book. I'm the kind of person who simply cannot ignore these, and as a result, constantly going to the back of the book to read them made it a bit harder for me to immerse myself in the main text. Now, this is mainly the fault of my own brain, so I'm not subtracting anything from my score for it. Just be aware of this fact if you happen to be like me. Personally, I think the footnotes would have been less distracting if they were put on the actual page where they were referenced.Still, this book was really enjoyable. I look forward to digging into Kean's newer works when I've got some time."

Subtitle: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the ElementsWho could have imagined such a volume written about that chart that hangs in every high school chemistry classroom? I’m an admitted science geek. I loved the “Mr Wizard” TV show when I was a kid. (He encouraged us to perform all sorts of experiments using our mother’s kitchen utensils and supplies.) I never wanted a Barbie doll, I wanted a chemistry set and a microscope! So, I’ve had this book on my TBR list since it first came out. And I have to say that I’m a little disappointed.It’s not that Kean is a bad writer; he isn’t, and he’s quite thorough in exploring this topic. His enthusiasm and fascination for the periodic table comes through. But, it was just too much even for this science geek. Some parts were far more interesting to me than others. I loved the chapter on poisons, for example. I was less enthralled with the political infighting on what name to give to a newly discovered element. Also, I made the choice to listen to the audio format. Sean Runnette did a fine job of performing the audio. However, the sometimes dry subject matter made for a more difficult listening experience. I might have enjoyed this more in text."
273,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3349963-craig-cottingham,4,"I was a chemical engineering major in college, so some of the background information (like the basics of the periodic table) was familiar to me and therefore a little tedious to read. Outside of that, however, this was a fascinating book that I think would be accessible to non-beakerheads.Each chapter is devoted to a group of elements that are related. Instead of going for the obvious groupings (the inert gasses, the halogens, etc.) he comes at them from a refreshingly sideways direction. There's a chapter on poisons (from the obvious like arsenic, to thallium, which was responsible for thousands of deaths from contaminated groundwater in Japan) and another on measurements (from the international standard kilogram, which is an ingot of iridium, to the cesium-powered atomic clocks which define the international standard second). Each one reads a little like an episode of James Burke's TV series Connections, the way the discussion of one element blends into another. Sometimes the connections and the groupings are a little contrived, but not jarringly so, and I'm sure it was necessary to avoid a ""here are all the elements that didn't fit in anywhere else"" chapter.Highly recommended."
274,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"There’s a lot packed into this book. I enjoyed the look of the history of the periodic table; how it got started, the changes made over time, the discoveries of elements. Intermingled are the stories of the people; the scientists who figured things out and made things happen. Intertwined yet again are the stories of the theory and workings of atoms; what makes them tick, what makes them unique, what makes them react. Then there’s all those scientists; some humorous, some deceitful or crazy for fame. I really enjoyed the bit about the periodic table in the future and how the table if ever-changing and expanding. This is a wonderful book for those who enjoy chemistry, physics and anything “earthy”. "
275,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Fun romp through the periodic table - lots of chemistry and physics, but even more stories about science and the people who do it. Sam Kean has fun with history. The book is not very technical, but approachable and occasionally humorous. The stories are diverse - there are many elements on the table, so we jump around quite a bit. I enjoyed this on audio, found it both educational and entertaining, but I probably won’t remember much as there is no common storyline other than the stories being about elements."
276,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,2,"Uneven and only fitfully engaging, The Disappearing Spoon is less a history of the periodic table and how scientists have come to understand elemental matter than it is a collection of facts about those elements and anecdotes about the various researchers who've discovered them. Sam Kean doesn't really have the knack for explaining (or re-explaining) scientific concepts to people who haven't studied chemistry or physics since secondary school, and relies too much on clunky metaphors and irritating anthropomorphisms. (For example, Kean writes that stars are ""[d]esperate to maintain high temperatures."" Stars are not sentient. They do not have feelings. Even more jaw-droppingly asinine, though, are sentences like ""In addition to Haber's being a Jew, Germany excommunicated him because he had become passé."" Do I need to break down why this is, at an absolute minimum, a tacky way of putting things?) He never actually fully explains how the periodic table works.More damningly to me, as a historian, is that Kean tries to write from a perspective which is determinedly presentist. His interest in the past seems to primarily stem from wanting to know the backstory of the discovery and refinement of certain scientific concepts, rather than any desire to engage with the history of science as an evolving conceptual system which is inevitably shaped by those who practice it. For a man who seems fascinated by the universe on scales both macro and micro, Kean seems profoundly uninterested in the human."
277,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"What Neil DeGrasse Tyson does for astronomy and David Attenborough does for zoology, Sam Kean does for chemistry and physics TOGETHER. There were a few times when the author simplified technical explanations, which I think made it more confusing. For that reason, I almost gave this book a 4. However there were enough moments where my mind was completely blown that I decided it had to be a 5. The first chapter is boring, but it is well worth pushing through. (What is it with science and very boring first chapters. Always. Start with something that draws me in for cryin' out loud!) There is a fascinating chapter on elements in times of war (Gold? Who needs gold? Give me molybdenum and tungsten.) and of course causing wars. A chapter that delves into lasers and masers (Holy shit, this was awesome! Seriously? How did I not know how lasers work? How did I learn all of the basic principles in physics, but I never learned how they come together in the most fantastic, brilliant way? I am happy to have rectified this situation.) and also the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a newish state of matter where a few thousand atoms becomes ""one giant marshmallow"" of an atom-a singularity and on a macro scale. This chapter ends with:""As technology keeps improving, scientists have gotten better and better at inducing matter to form the BEC. It's not like anyone's taking orders yet, but scientists might soon be able to build 'matter lasers' that shoot out ultra-focused beams of atoms thousands of times more powerful that light lasers, or construct 'supersolid' ice cubes that CAN FLOW THROUGH EACH OTHER WITHOUT LOSING THEIR SOLIDITY [emphasis mine]."" If I were a science teacher, the very next thing I would do after teaching this is have my students write a sci-fi story touching on where this technology is going next. What's it like to live in a world where solids can flow through each other? I know it's impossibly silly, but I immediately imagined humans that can walk through walls and stuff like that. Of course, this only happens at way below zero temperatures and on a very small scale. But you know, a girl can dream. There's also a chapter called ""Poisoner's Corridor: 'Ouch-Ouch'."" No need to elaborate. There's a chapter on elements as currency and of course fraud. There's even a section on how elements deceive our sense of taste-fascinating! (An example- chewing potassium gymnemate will make raw sugar heaped on your tongue taste like sand)Some other awesome tidbits:The person who discovered x-rays thought he went mad when he first saw the bones of his hands and a key hidden in a book. ""The primary component of taste, smell, is the only sense that bypasses our logical neural processing and connects directly to the brain's emotional centers.""""And whereas electrons absorb and emit light of the same color (yellow in, yellow out), fluorescent molecules absorb high-energy light (ultraviolet light) but emit that energy as lower-energy, visible light."" That's why we can see scorpions glow in the dark under black lights! This is what makes UV visible to us! The most powerful lasers today can produce beams that for a fraction of a second produce more power than the whole United States.Seriously, this book goes all over the place, but still manages to be organized. Loved it! "
278,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie,3,"""The Disappearing Spoon"" teaches the chemistry and physics of atoms and the periodic table. It's taught primarily in the context of short biographies about the Noble prize winning scientists (plus some others) who discovered the various elements or who discovered important things about how the elements or atoms are put together.Based on the book description I was given, I was expecting more trivia about the elements and how they are and have been used rather than a book teaching science with a main focus on scientists. However, the author's casual, lively, and sometimes crude tone made the stories entertaining--probably even more so to young males than to me. I did get a little tired of the author's judgmental attitude, though. It seemed like every human action had to be either brilliant or insanely stupid.The author's explanations of how things worked (atoms, periodic table, etc.) were easy for me to follow, but that might partly be because I took a lot of science courses in college. The initial science lessons were high school level, but the ending lessons were more college level (though high schoolers can probably follow them).The book primarily focused on science and scientists, but there were a few stories of invention, greed, destruction or just plain weirdness based around non-scientists. Though I didn't actually check to make sure, it seemed like every element on the periodic table was covered at least briefly. Some of the areas in which he discussed the use of the elements were warfare (chemical warfare, nuclear bombs, dirty bombs), medicine, politics, art, biology (especially DNA), as poison, as money (counterfeiting, a strange gold rush), and under super-cool conditions. He also covered a Big Bang model of how the elements were formed (with a ""see, no god needed!"" emphasis), how radiometric dating methods were thought up and used to generate dates for the age of the Earth that were old enough to give biological evolution a chance of occurring (since previous dating methods gave too ""young"" of an age to allow for it), and how biases can prevent critical viewing of scientific data (though he didn't seem to notice his own bias).He worked a lot of ""there is no God, humans & Earth aren't special, and evolution is true"" apologetics into this book. I wouldn't mind so much if, in the appendix, he hadn't presented what ""young-earth creationists believe"" by mixing true statements with misrepresented and apparently ridiculous ones as well as completely inaccurate ones. So now, if these readers come across the true argument, they'll dismiss it without really considering it--they'll think they know all about it when they don't.There were a few black and white photographs of scientists and a few charts. Overall, the book was entertaining and interesting, though not so much so that I'd want to read it again. The people who'd be most interested by it are probably teen or college age males who idolize science as pure and untarnished but who also like somewhat scandalous tales about scientists, their competitions to make Noble-winning discoveries, and their fights over who made a discovery first.I received this Advanced Reader Copy for review purposes from the publisher. "
279,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author relates many anecdotes of the discovery and uses of several elements with (as he says about those who know the periodic table) ""dweeby nonchalance.” It is meant to be a readable, interesting book of popular science for the lay reader, and indeed it is full of fascinating anecdotes about all things elemental. (The titular spoon is made of gallium, metal that melts in low temperatures and therefore a spoon made of it dissolves in tea. Ha ha, periodic table practical jokes!) Based on the title alone, I expected a lot of anecdotes such as the battle over the molybdenum mine in Colorado during WWII to help the Nazi war effort, or endless spats over naming rights of elements, but this book contains so much more. The madman Fritz Haber and his chlorine gas experiments; how the niobium in your cell phone helped finance the brutal Congo wars; an overview of the Bose-Einstein Condensate, the fifth state of matter; Henry Moseley’s electron beam; the alpha constant; why silicon-based life forms are extremely unlikely; Cobalt 60 dirty bombs; Monte Carlo science, itai-itai disease caused by Cadmium poisoning from mining companies on Japan; the role of gadolinium in MRI machines and cancer fighting; the left or right ""handedness"" of proteins; sulfur bacteria and how it relates to the sense of taste; the longest ""word"" ever, a technical term that is too long to be written; why we can unknowingly breathe in nitrogen without gasping for air until we suddenly collapse and die; why idolaters of Gandhi dislike iodine; how a lack of salt in a person suggests the nonexistence of the soul; how brass might be the nugget of truth behind the King Midas myth; how the science of bubbles led to the discovery of radon; and more. As you can see, the scope of this work is vast, possibly too much so. While it is written in a personable, conversational style, I felt that Kean doesn't manage to convey to the meanest scientific intelligence (namely me) a full understanding of the science he uses in the book, such as the aforementioned alpha constant, or how exactly electrons move from their ""shells."" Such information isn't necessary to appreciate the scientific history here, so for me it would have been better off cut entirely if impossible to simplify. I don't need the technical details to approve of a book that tells us that Lewis and Clark's route can be traced by the trace mercury in their feces, or refers to a Mark Twain story in which Satan is depicted as being made of radium, or that Paul McCartney was awarded a rhodium record (rather than gold or platinum) for his unsurpassed sales. That's the stuff that keeps the lay reader in their seats."
280,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Sam Kean has written a witty, interesting book about the elements in the Periodic Table. He writes as if he was chatting with the reader in a coffee shop or a tavern, regaling his friends with one anecdote after another. He's imparting his knowledge of science by the use of quirky, fun facts and interesting stories about the scientists involved.This is not set up like a typical chemistry textbook. The chapters are divided into areas of interest such as astronomy, poisons, money, war, medicine, and periods of history. The author is a physicist so the book had a lot of information about elements made in the lab, radioactive elements, nuclear chemistry, and the atomic bomb. For me, that was the most challenging part of the book.He writes about Linus Pauling's theory of a triple helix being trumped by James Watson and Francis Crick's double helix model of DNA. The attractive Marie Curie was a source of gossip when she took men into dark closets to show them radioactive specimens. Ghandhi told the people of India to dry their own salt instead of paying a British salt tax, only to have many people develop goiter due to lack of iodine. The trail taken by Lewis and Clark is known because anthropologists found (poisonous) mercury capsules that the explorers were using as laxatives. These types of stories make science seem more approachable.The title of the book comes from a practical joke. Gallium, which resembles aluminum, is a solid below 84 degrees F, and can be molded into a spoon. When it is dipped into hot tea, the surprised guest finds the spoon disappearing as it melts away. (Youtube has some ""disappearing spoon"" videos.)This is a book that can be enjoyed by the lay person as well as a scientist. Some chapters will be much easier to understand if a reader has had an introduction to the Periodic Table, such as in a high school Chemistry course. I would have preferred having the footnotes on the bottom of the pages rather than in the back of the book. Overall, the author should be commended for making science fun."

Once the instructor talked about electrons, protons, atoms and the nucleus I usually turned on my Walkman (the cassette kind, now antique!). It never seemed interesting because it wasn't something that related at all to real life. If I had a teacher like Sam Kean, however, that could have been different.Fast forward too many years, and now I'm engrossed in this nonfiction 'memoir' of the Periodic Table of Elements. Like any good biography, this has scandal, lies, fraud, madness, explosions (!!!) and lots of name-dropping. Kean explains just what the periodic table is, but in a format that reads more like a novel, with anecdotal details to liven it up. Mercury pills were used by Lewis and Clark for their health? Yep, and you can trace their path (um, at least their bathroom trips on their journey) by where scientists have found unusually high amounts of mercury in the soil. The poet Robert Lowell? Did lithium ruin his work by making him sane? Who knew the lies and fraud and mind games played by scientists intent on getting a Nobel Prize! There's no getting around it, this is a book that makes you think. It's not simple and it assumes you have a basic knowledge of science. Some areas were over my head, but not for long. Kean is a wonderful teacher with a sassy wise guy voice that livens up any of the deeper areas."

A delightful, an engaging blend of lyrical prose, historic anecdotes and fascinating information. Reminiscent, to me, of some of the writing of Lewis Thomas, Oliver Sacks, Barry Lopez, Edward Abbey and John McPhee.Brain/mind candy or chicken soup for the nerd's soul. Does that make me a dualist?The chapter essays are wide ranging anecdotal expositions of elements and families of elements. Not only stories about the scientists who prospected for and predicted the existence of certain elements, and created schemata for organizing them but about the influence of various elements on cultures, politics, economics and even philosophy. The stories added greatly to my appreciation for and understanding of the lives and work of some well known and some no longer famous scientists. The meditations on peculiar properties of some groups of atoms and alternative arrangements for the Periodic Table bumped my rating of the book from between 4 and 5 stars to clearly 5 stars. Others not so smitten on the history of science and mathematics may find it only mildly interesting or even boring. A must read for nerds, history buffs and fans of creative non-fiction. "

A wonderful and engaging read from cover-to-cover. Sam Kean takes the periodic table of the elements, a chart that makes most people cringe at thoughts of high school (or college) chemistry, and turns it into a riveting drama about the table's origins and the hunt to find new elements. Science geeks will love the scientific jargon but you don't need a degree in chemistry to understand the fascinating stories behind the revolutionaries responsible for our modern day technologies. This is definitely a book you can read over and over and still find little morsels you might have previously missed. Kean is amusing, insightful and presents complex information in a very understable package. A must read for fans of scientific history."

I so wish we’d had this as a set text when I took chemistry in high school. Not only might I have understood the rubbish our teacher was spouting, I might’ve liked it and even passed the bloody thing! Nobody ever even bothered to explain the Periodic Table to us and why it looks the way it does. And it's true: watching a gallium spoon dissolve in a glass of water is pretty cool.I had no idea the world of chemistry and physics was such a hotbed of rivalry, gossip and scandal. Delicious stuff."

But now I eagerly scour the non-fiction shelves at the library. I know -- it’s crazy!The only explanation is that non-fiction has gotten better. (It can’t be me that’s changed.) The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean is a fine example of this better, more interesting non-fiction. Kean doesn’t skimp on the facts. He’s packed his book with oodles of information about the elements. What saves his book from being merely a mind-numbing collection of elemental characteristics may be gleaned from the book’s full title: The Disappearing Spoon and Other Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of Elements.Yes, it’s the madness and weirdness that brings the elements to life, and Kean seems to have dug up a fascinating story for virtually every element on the periodic table. For example, the title’s disappearing spoon refers to a (nerdy) practical joke in which unsuspecting victims are given a gallium spoon to stir their tea. I was particularly interested in the stories surrounding the radioactive elements, which ranged from an ex-KGB spy that was murdered with polonium-laced sushi in 2006 to a boy scout that tried to build his own nuclear reactor.Reading non-fiction like this is not only painless, but fun, and I’m convinced that I’m retaining all of those pesky little facts better that I normally would because I’ve so enjoyed learning them. Just wait until we meet at the next dinner party and I regale you with tales of elemental hijinks. If you’ve long despaired of enjoying non-fiction, perhaps now is the time to give it another try. "
288,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,4,"I pretty much knew I was going to like this book as soon as I heard about it. I mean, come on, it's about science! Some of the factoids I learned in this book will stick with me for a long time, like the naturally occurring nuclear reactor in Africa, or the reason why the Washington monument is capped with aluminum. At first I was disappointed that the book had end notes instead of footnotes. I do like footnotes. However, many of them were so long that I understood the reason for it. I ended up just having two bookmarks, one for where I was in the book, and one for where I was in the end notes.On one hand, there were sections that I feel I would have liked better if it hadn't been so long since my last chemistry class. On the other hand, if I were more well-versed in chemistry, some of the stories wouldn't have been so new and interesting to me.There were one or two slow sections in this book, but the interesting sections more than balanced it out. More to the point, this was a book that made me feel smarter for having read it--that goes a long way.One minor quibble that bothered me is that while there were two blank periodic tables which I found quickly, the actual periodic table in the book comes so close to the end that I wasn't able to find it, and I was looking for one. I would have liked to have one to reference. By the time I found it, I was almost done with the book and didn't need it as much. If the periodic table had been printed as an end paper, or in the beginning, or even at the start of the end notes where I could have found it, that would have made it easier to understand some of what the author talked about. After all, it's been a while since high school chemistry, and I only look at that chart periodically. (ha ha)"
289,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1951489-amanda,4,"Think back to your high school chemistry class. Chances are, the artwork adorning the classroom probably contained a poster with the periodic table of the elements. For some reason, all through 7 chemistry classes, my favorite was tungsten.Pop quiz - what is the chemical symbol for tungsten? Why, ""W"" of course! Why not T or Tu or Tg?? The ""W""is for wolfram, the German name for tungsten. Without it, those handy incandescent lightbulbs would not operate if it weren't for those tungsten filaments.I've always had a soft spot for science trivia, and the periodic table of the elements is full of interesting stories. If you have the same soft spot, I'd recommend ""The Disappearing Spoon"" by Sam Keane. The title references a property of the element gallium. Gallium turns from a solid to a liquid at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the author, a favorite prank of grad students is to fashion spoons made of gallium and to hand them out with tea or coffee. The spoon looks like the metal of other silverware, but when used in tea or coffee, melts away - a disappearing spoon!Another reason this is a great book is that it humanizes many of the famous scientists. In reading through textbooks, you never see into the personal lives or professional struggles of the discoveries and constants described in the text. Yet in The Disappearing Spoon, you see the races to get published (discovering and naming rights to elements), the discouragement at being passed up for a Nobel Prize yet again, and how wars and politics shape the or stunt technology."

I went to Barnes & Noble the other day with the wife, ostensibly to get a cup of coffee, and picked up this book and Jose Saramago's 'The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'. I couldn't tell you what it was about it that caught my attention. I'm doing that thing again where I read too many books at once, but despite my inward pleas to the contrary, I couldn't resist picking it up and starting to read. What a great book. Refreshing, endlessly intriguing. Every page was a pleasure. Basically a book like this tells me two things: what a whiny spoiled brat I am, and what a complete dimwitted ape I am. In these pages I read about a woman who rode horseback for 1200 miles through a Russian winter to get her kid to a college only to see him rejected, and she then rode 400 more miles to get him to yet another school after which she promptly, and understandably, died. That's just so Russian. Then I read about a man who not only invented the Bunsen burner, he also invented the Spectrometer, and subsequently discovered several new elements, all in the 1850s. I look at myself and realize I'm liable to get suicidal if we run out of half and half, and my greatest achievement in life has been to arrange The Police's 'Roxanne' for the ukulele. Sometimes a good dose of perspective is extremely illuminating. "
291,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3387843-celine,4,"Did you love it when your teacher told funny science anecdotes? Then The Disappearing Spoon might be the book for you.This book is exactly what it is made out to be. With a full title of The Disappearing Spoon And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, it tells you everything you should know. Kean starts with the periodic table, talks about how it was created, and from there, tells of fun, tragic, or interesting stories about all of the elements.Most of the science in The Disappearing Spoon is understandable with a high-school knowledge of chemistry. But even if you don't know enough chemistry, those parts can easily be skipped. Most of the book is heavily inspired by scientific history, rather than science itself. If you want to know more about the bickering and rivalries between chemists, this book is perfect. The Disappearing Spoon is highly entertaining, and it's clear the author has done extensive research into the lives of the scientists he talks about. My only gripe is that he has the tendency to lose direction sometimes, and flounders between all of the threads of stories he started, no longer clear on exactly what point he wanted to make. "

This is at times a ""cute book"" but in spite of it's promise it will help you if you have a deep abiding love of chemistry before you crack it open.It doesn't really appear to be organized all that well and isn't truly geared to the average reader. He opens up with his early fascination with mercury (the element, not the planet or the mythological deity) and how it led him into literature etc. Then he sets out to induce us all into the wonder/wonders that is/are the periodic table. I wasn't drawn into chemistry beyond what's required in high school, neither was I here. It didn't work, I lost interest quickly and wasn't interested in going on with the class.Enjoy if it's cup of tea...not mine. Maybe you'll like it, but I can't recommend it."
293,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"A fun read, for a certain value of fun. This is a book for science geeks, or those curious about science. If you're a full-fledged science geek, this could be a relatively light side read. If you're more of a layman, it's an opportunity to read some science that shouldn't be too far over your head, most of the time. I fall in the latter category. I wouldn't exactly call this a light read (though it's certainly easier going than some books that I've attempted) but the personable tone and fascinating stories kept me interested even when the going got a little tough. For a more science literate reader, those same stories would probably make it easier to get through the more familiar territory without getting bored. So yes, I did have fun, and I learned a few things, and I gave my brain a bit of a workout. Which is exactly what I like to see in a book about science."
294,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,3,"Since I have ditched my chemical engineering degree for a (once shiny) computer science one, whenever I see books like these I tend to gravitate towards them in pure nostalgia and consume them with a single minded passion. This book especially incited fond memories from my college days when we were consuming chemistry and its historical progress. I still have my periodic table poster that hung next to my bed for a good part of last decade. It was fun to read anecdotes, vignettes and author's own dealings with elements. The writing is casual, occasionally whimsical, terribly nostalgic and overall interesting. Though Kean refrains from overt use of technical jargon, it just isn't possible to escape it completely. With a dose of nostalgia, I enjoyed reading this."
295,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5984690-sean-o,5,"One of the top non-fiction books I've read this year. It's full of exactly the kind of stories I like: scientists and other clever people finding out about the universe. This one is all about the Periodic Table of Elements, and stories about every single element. Some get star treatment, but even ultra-rare Francium gets a shout out. The science is good and the writer doesn't dumb things down too much. He also makes excellent use of foot notes which provide great asides as well as jumping off points for further reading. "
296,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999881-geoff,3,This book is filled with stories about the discoveries of the elements of the periodic table - some I knew and many I had never heard before. 
297,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"This is a relatively slim book, but it’s packed with super interesting stories you never learned in chemistry, like:1) Scientists tracked the path of Lewis & Clark across America by looking for mercury deposits. The party took mercury tablets to “cure” ailments, and wherever they went #2, they left mercury in the soil2) 7 different elements were discovered in Ytterby, a tiny suburban town in Sweden3) the elements in the periodic table haven’t always been around: originally, there was just hydrogen. Through a variety of reactions, hydrogen (the simplest element) produced all other elements on the periodic table in our solar system. (This makes me wonder: what do other solar systems look like, elementally? Did they experience the same reactions yielding the same elements, or an entirely different set?)4) the creator of the death gas used in WW2 concentration camps, Zyklon B (well, the first version anyway, named Zyklon A—it got slightly tweaked) was Franz Haber, a Jewish man famous for killing many Allied soldiers in painful chemical ways during WWI. Zyklon B was later used to murder thousands of people, including Haber’s own relatives5) Two elements called niobium and tantalum (named after Niobe and Tantalus from Greek myth) are found in the the Congo, combined in a rock called coltan. Niobium and tantalum are metals used in cell phones. The huge demand for coltan in the late 1990s/early 2000s caused anarchy and devastation in the Congo6) A scientist named Seaborg who worked on the Manhattan Project discovered the elements americium (which powers smoke detectors, by the way) and curium in 1946. Rather than announcing it in a scientific journal, Seaborg announced it on a children’s show, Quiz Kids (a child asked Seaborg if he’d discovered any new elements lately, and he explained that he had; judging by the mail he received from schoolchildren, teachers across the globe refused to believe the children’s claims the next week in school)7) the first antibacterial drug wasn’t penicillin (the first antibiotic)—in 1932, a man named Domagk discovered that Prontosil, an industrial dye, could be injected into a sick person to cure them of a bacterial infection (Domagk initially made this discovery on mice; when his daughter Hildegarde tripped while holding a sewing needle and acquired a life-threatening infection, Domagk gave it a whirl in humans, and she got better)8) Tellurium smells strongly of garlic. Beryllium tastes like sugar (despite being a toxic metal). Potassium tastes like salt!9) the European Union, appropriately, uses europium in the ink on euros to show they’re not counterfeit10) In the African nation of Gabon, there exists the only natural nuclear fission reactor known to exist, called Oklo—fueled by uranium, blue-green algae (pond scum), and plain water (the only reason there’s not a gigantic hole burned into Gabon? When the uranium reaches critical mass, it boils off the water, and without the water, the reaction stops). My favourite chapter was chapter 9 (on poisonous elements) because poison is cool. I was especially interested in how a local doctor (Noboru Hagino) discovered that cadmium was poisoning the people of Kamioka, Japan: with the help of a public health professor, he plotted the homes of all the people who came down with the mysterious disease (known as itai-itai, or “ouch ouch” disease), and was able to discover that they all lived along the Jinzu River, which carried cadmium, a waste product from the local mine. This reminded me a lot of The Ghost Map, which, as in the case of Kamioka, tells the story of how a local doctor and a public health professional teamed up to trace the root of a deadly disease (cholera, in that case) using mapping. (Speaking of London—I was also interested to see Alexander Litvinenko, murdered by polonium-spiked tea in a London sushi restaurant, get a mention; I recently saw his grave in Highgate Cemetery). Definitely a fun read if you have a spare afternoon and wish you knew the more fun side of chemistry."
298,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4053034-laura,1,"I didn't finish this book. I couldn't finish this book because the parts of this book that are about science I know could most generously be described as ""missleading at best"". If that's the case about the stuff I know, how much is true in the stuff I don't know? I'm called upon to teach some chemistry despite the fact my real chemistry knowledge pretty much ends at physical chemistry and astrochemistry - so I really don't need to fill my head with stories and theories that are pale reflections of the current state of knowledge when I don't read enough of the literature to judge how correct they are.I'm not sure where the author looked up the theory of solar system formation he gives in Chapter 4, but it wasn't in anything written in the last 20 years. If he'd turned in what's written here on an astronomy exam when I was in a generous mood I might give him a point or two for having a couple of right ideas in there, but he'd still have an F.I started to get a clue there was a problem when the author called the collision of comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 (1993 F2) with Jupiter ""intergalactic"". Huh? How is the collision of two solar system objects intergalactic? There's no evidence that SL9 was an extra-solar comet, much less an extra-galactic comet, but ok, he's using an odd hyperbole to make it sound more exciting. Overall the book has a very bubbly, casual style to it so I'll let him use this oddly chosen word. Things get worse however, when he implies Jupiter is the reason C/Hale-Bopp (1995 O1) came into the inner solar system. At this point I'm still assuming he knows that is not true and he's wording things really poorly, but I'm beginning to doubt I know enough of the science in other parts of the book to be able to see through this sort of thing elsewhere. However, it's when he writes ""Because the stellar wind blew only the lightest, most common elements as far out as Jupiter, it should have the same basic elemental composition as real stars"", that I pause and make a WTF!?! note in the margin. It takes me half a lecture or more to explain our current understanding of solar system formation, so I won't go through it all in this review, but the above is pure nonsense. More pure nonsense occurs when he mentions that the cloud of gas and dust our solar system formed out of was flat. There's no evidence for that and it's extremely unlikely dynamically. Simple physics flattens any shape of cloud collapsing under gravity to a spinning disk.Coming back to the missleading at best parts, we are told there are apparently mini-nuclear booms in stars counterbalancing gravity rather than thermal pressure. Booms implies a series of nuclear bombs going off when it is actually the steady rate of fusion in the interior of the Sun that causes the thermal pressure that balances gravity. Finally, given that I'm a planetary scientist, I just can't let slide the description of the Moon forming due to an ""asteroid or comet impact"". Well ok. If you want to call a roughly Mars sized planetesimal an asteroid or comet. However, there aren't any Mars sized planetesimals left that we'd call an asteroid or comet today. Mars is really in no danger of being demoted from planet-hood.I haven't picked on every problem with the astrophysics presented in this chapter, but all this and more brings me to the end of Chapter 4 with no trust the author knows anything about what he's talking about. This is likely not true given all the glowing reviews, one even appearing in the well respected journal Nature (I'm guessing a review by a chemist that knew no astronomy?). But having lost my trust it can't be regained, and I won't be finishing this book."
299,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9255064-melissa,4,"Chemistry has never been my thing. I hated it in high school (except for the part where we melted mechanical pencils over the Bunsen burner). Recently watching the chemistry Crash Course episodes has reminded me that chemistry is not just the boring science class I struggled to stay awake through in high school. Chemistry is everything around us and understanding a bit about it will help me better understand the way the world works.So I picked up The Disappearing Spoon with that in mind and was richly rewarded. Kean’s writing style was fun and made the subject matter interesting. He talks not only about the science behind each element, but about the scientists who discovered them and the impact they had on the world. For example Mendeleev, who is credited with creating the Periodic Table, had a fascinating start. He was born in Siberia, the youngest of 11 children. His father died when he was only 13 and his mother worked incredibly hard to give him the chance to go to school. Imagine having to overcome all of those things just to be able to go to school! Another favorite of mine was Marie Curie. Her fascinating life, including a marriage that was far ahead of its time and the discovery of multiple elements was so interesting. She won a Nobel Prize in a time when women in America weren’t even allowed to vote. I would love to a biography that focused solely on her.The periodic table has changed the world in both positive and negative ways. Kean doesn’t shy away from the damage that’s been done because of the discovery of a new element. He talks about the effects of vaccinations and medicines and also at the way chemistry made things like the atom bomb possible. When cell phones became wildly popular in the 1990s the fight to find more of the metal used to create them caused the Congo to explode with fighting. People were in a frenzy to provide the metal that was in such high demand. “Overall more than 5 million people have died in Congo since the mid-1990s, making it the biggest waste of life since World War II. The fighting there is proof that in addition to all the uplifting moments the Periodic table has inspired it can also play on humankind's worst, most inhumane instincts.”This balanced look at the Table reminds us that with great knowledge (just like great power) comes great responsibility. Almost any scientific advance can be used for good or bad and there will always be a struggle to use it correctly. BOTTOM LINE: The most interesting book I’ve read ever read about chemistry and one that kept me intrigued the entire time. We live in a truly remarkable world and I’ll never regret reading a book that opens up a new corner of that world to me."
300,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/981514-minli,4,"Entertaining read--and a fascinating subject matter. I'm definitely the right audience for this book: someone who knows some chemistry but didn't get any higher degrees in it, and is more interested in the historical, cultural building of the periodic table than the hard science.Kean's wry prose never lets you forget that his point of view is subjective and conversational: he paints caricatures of famous scientists and makes ridiculous analogies. His audience is undoubtedly American. He does his best to explain concepts (some of which I still remembered!) in layman's terms, though I kind of dozed off at the discussion of alpha. He does a good job giving awesome lady scientists their due, like Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin, Maria Groppert-Mayer and Marie Curie. I learned a bunch of things, how thallium is the worst ever poison (the poisoner's poison) and that cobalt-60 is the dirtiest and worst ever a-bomb. The structuring of the elements grouped into chapters, chapters grouped into parts, gave the book a flow and rhythm. It might have benefited from a longer conclusion.This book has made me feel like the biggest dork ever, because when people mention some element now, I have to squash the impulse to say, ""Hey! Did you know that...""The Disappearing Spoon also showed to me what my chemistry, biology and physics teachers in high school and college never did: how magical, weird, wonderful, temperamental, dangerous and dramatic science can be, how they're heterogeneously mixed with Romance and politics. I wish I'd had this book in high school."
301,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19832185-thomas-frank,4,"As someone who never took chemistry, I found this book to provide just enough of the basics about the periodic table to enable me to sound at least a bit better than completely ignorant when talking about the subject. Beyond that, it's filled with interesting stories about the people who helped build the table and discover many of its elements, as well as other events that revolve around said elements. I particularly enjoyed the one about Germany's clandestine operations in the U.S. during WWI.One nitpick I had with this book: Every 2-3 pages, you'll find an asterisk that corresponds to a footnote in the back of the book. I'm the kind of person who simply cannot ignore these, and as a result, constantly going to the back of the book to read them made it a bit harder for me to immerse myself in the main text. Now, this is mainly the fault of my own brain, so I'm not subtracting anything from my score for it. Just be aware of this fact if you happen to be like me. Personally, I think the footnotes would have been less distracting if they were put on the actual page where they were referenced.Still, this book was really enjoyable. I look forward to digging into Kean's newer works when I've got some time."

Subtitle: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the ElementsWho could have imagined such a volume written about that chart that hangs in every high school chemistry classroom? I’m an admitted science geek. I loved the “Mr Wizard” TV show when I was a kid. (He encouraged us to perform all sorts of experiments using our mother’s kitchen utensils and supplies.) I never wanted a Barbie doll, I wanted a chemistry set and a microscope! So, I’ve had this book on my TBR list since it first came out. And I have to say that I’m a little disappointed.It’s not that Kean is a bad writer; he isn’t, and he’s quite thorough in exploring this topic. His enthusiasm and fascination for the periodic table comes through. But, it was just too much even for this science geek. Some parts were far more interesting to me than others. I loved the chapter on poisons, for example. I was less enthralled with the political infighting on what name to give to a newly discovered element. Also, I made the choice to listen to the audio format. Sean Runnette did a fine job of performing the audio. However, the sometimes dry subject matter made for a more difficult listening experience. I might have enjoyed this more in text."
303,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3349963-craig-cottingham,4,"I was a chemical engineering major in college, so some of the background information (like the basics of the periodic table) was familiar to me and therefore a little tedious to read. Outside of that, however, this was a fascinating book that I think would be accessible to non-beakerheads.Each chapter is devoted to a group of elements that are related. Instead of going for the obvious groupings (the inert gasses, the halogens, etc.) he comes at them from a refreshingly sideways direction. There's a chapter on poisons (from the obvious like arsenic, to thallium, which was responsible for thousands of deaths from contaminated groundwater in Japan) and another on measurements (from the international standard kilogram, which is an ingot of iridium, to the cesium-powered atomic clocks which define the international standard second). Each one reads a little like an episode of James Burke's TV series Connections, the way the discussion of one element blends into another. Sometimes the connections and the groupings are a little contrived, but not jarringly so, and I'm sure it was necessary to avoid a ""here are all the elements that didn't fit in anywhere else"" chapter.Highly recommended."
304,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"There’s a lot packed into this book. I enjoyed the look of the history of the periodic table; how it got started, the changes made over time, the discoveries of elements. Intermingled are the stories of the people; the scientists who figured things out and made things happen. Intertwined yet again are the stories of the theory and workings of atoms; what makes them tick, what makes them unique, what makes them react. Then there’s all those scientists; some humorous, some deceitful or crazy for fame. I really enjoyed the bit about the periodic table in the future and how the table if ever-changing and expanding. This is a wonderful book for those who enjoy chemistry, physics and anything “earthy”. "
305,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Fun romp through the periodic table - lots of chemistry and physics, but even more stories about science and the people who do it. Sam Kean has fun with history. The book is not very technical, but approachable and occasionally humorous. The stories are diverse - there are many elements on the table, so we jump around quite a bit. I enjoyed this on audio, found it both educational and entertaining, but I probably won’t remember much as there is no common storyline other than the stories being about elements."
306,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,2,"Uneven and only fitfully engaging, The Disappearing Spoon is less a history of the periodic table and how scientists have come to understand elemental matter than it is a collection of facts about those elements and anecdotes about the various researchers who've discovered them. Sam Kean doesn't really have the knack for explaining (or re-explaining) scientific concepts to people who haven't studied chemistry or physics since secondary school, and relies too much on clunky metaphors and irritating anthropomorphisms. (For example, Kean writes that stars are ""[d]esperate to maintain high temperatures."" Stars are not sentient. They do not have feelings. Even more jaw-droppingly asinine, though, are sentences like ""In addition to Haber's being a Jew, Germany excommunicated him because he had become passé."" Do I need to break down why this is, at an absolute minimum, a tacky way of putting things?) He never actually fully explains how the periodic table works.More damningly to me, as a historian, is that Kean tries to write from a perspective which is determinedly presentist. His interest in the past seems to primarily stem from wanting to know the backstory of the discovery and refinement of certain scientific concepts, rather than any desire to engage with the history of science as an evolving conceptual system which is inevitably shaped by those who practice it. For a man who seems fascinated by the universe on scales both macro and micro, Kean seems profoundly uninterested in the human."

There were a few times when the author simplified technical explanations, which I think made it more confusing. For that reason, I almost gave this book a 4. However there were enough moments where my mind was completely blown that I decided it had to be a 5. The first chapter is boring, but it is well worth pushing through. (What is it with science and very boring first chapters. Always. Start with something that draws me in for cryin' out loud!) There is a fascinating chapter on elements in times of war (Gold? Who needs gold? Give me molybdenum and tungsten.) and of course causing wars. A chapter that delves into lasers and masers (Holy shit, this was awesome! Seriously? How did I not know how lasers work? How did I learn all of the basic principles in physics, but I never learned how they come together in the most fantastic, brilliant way? I am happy to have rectified this situation.) and also the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a newish state of matter where a few thousand atoms becomes ""one giant marshmallow"" of an atom-a singularity and on a macro scale. This chapter ends with:""As technology keeps improving, scientists have gotten better and better at inducing matter to form the BEC. It's not like anyone's taking orders yet, but scientists might soon be able to build 'matter lasers' that shoot out ultra-focused beams of atoms thousands of times more powerful that light lasers, or construct 'supersolid' ice cubes that CAN FLOW THROUGH EACH OTHER WITHOUT LOSING THEIR SOLIDITY [emphasis mine]."" If I were a science teacher, the very next thing I would do after teaching this is have my students write a sci-fi story touching on where this technology is going next. What's it like to live in a world where solids can flow through each other? I know it's impossibly silly, but I immediately imagined humans that can walk through walls and stuff like that. Of course, this only happens at way below zero temperatures and on a very small scale. But you know, a girl can dream. There's also a chapter called ""Poisoner's Corridor: 'Ouch-Ouch'."" No need to elaborate. There's a chapter on elements as currency and of course fraud. There's even a section on how elements deceive our sense of taste-fascinating! (An example- chewing potassium gymnemate will make raw sugar heaped on your tongue taste like sand)Some other awesome tidbits:The person who discovered x-rays thought he went mad when he first saw the bones of his hands and a key hidden in a book. ""The primary component of taste, smell, is the only sense that bypasses our logical neural processing and connects directly to the brain's emotional centers.""""And whereas electrons absorb and emit light of the same color (yellow in, yellow out), fluorescent molecules absorb high-energy light (ultraviolet light) but emit that energy as lower-energy, visible light."" That's why we can see scorpions glow in the dark under black lights! This is what makes UV visible to us! The most powerful lasers today can produce beams that for a fraction of a second produce more power than the whole United States.Seriously, this book goes all over the place, but still manages to be organized. Loved it! "
308,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie,3,"""The Disappearing Spoon"" teaches the chemistry and physics of atoms and the periodic table. It's taught primarily in the context of short biographies about the Noble prize winning scientists (plus some others) who discovered the various elements or who discovered important things about how the elements or atoms are put together.Based on the book description I was given, I was expecting more trivia about the elements and how they are and have been used rather than a book teaching science with a main focus on scientists. However, the author's casual, lively, and sometimes crude tone made the stories entertaining--probably even more so to young males than to me. I did get a little tired of the author's judgmental attitude, though. It seemed like every human action had to be either brilliant or insanely stupid.The author's explanations of how things worked (atoms, periodic table, etc.) were easy for me to follow, but that might partly be because I took a lot of science courses in college. The initial science lessons were high school level, but the ending lessons were more college level (though high schoolers can probably follow them).The book primarily focused on science and scientists, but there were a few stories of invention, greed, destruction or just plain weirdness based around non-scientists. Though I didn't actually check to make sure, it seemed like every element on the periodic table was covered at least briefly. Some of the areas in which he discussed the use of the elements were warfare (chemical warfare, nuclear bombs, dirty bombs), medicine, politics, art, biology (especially DNA), as poison, as money (counterfeiting, a strange gold rush), and under super-cool conditions. He also covered a Big Bang model of how the elements were formed (with a ""see, no god needed!"" emphasis), how radiometric dating methods were thought up and used to generate dates for the age of the Earth that were old enough to give biological evolution a chance of occurring (since previous dating methods gave too ""young"" of an age to allow for it), and how biases can prevent critical viewing of scientific data (though he didn't seem to notice his own bias).He worked a lot of ""there is no God, humans & Earth aren't special, and evolution is true"" apologetics into this book. I wouldn't mind so much if, in the appendix, he hadn't presented what ""young-earth creationists believe"" by mixing true statements with misrepresented and apparently ridiculous ones as well as completely inaccurate ones. So now, if these readers come across the true argument, they'll dismiss it without really considering it--they'll think they know all about it when they don't.There were a few black and white photographs of scientists and a few charts. Overall, the book was entertaining and interesting, though not so much so that I'd want to read it again. The people who'd be most interested by it are probably teen or college age males who idolize science as pure and untarnished but who also like somewhat scandalous tales about scientists, their competitions to make Noble-winning discoveries, and their fights over who made a discovery first.I received this Advanced Reader Copy for review purposes from the publisher. "
309,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author relates many anecdotes of the discovery and uses of several elements with (as he says about those who know the periodic table) ""dweeby nonchalance.” It is meant to be a readable, interesting book of popular science for the lay reader, and indeed it is full of fascinating anecdotes about all things elemental. (The titular spoon is made of gallium, metal that melts in low temperatures and therefore a spoon made of it dissolves in tea. Ha ha, periodic table practical jokes!) Based on the title alone, I expected a lot of anecdotes such as the battle over the molybdenum mine in Colorado during WWII to help the Nazi war effort, or endless spats over naming rights of elements, but this book contains so much more. The madman Fritz Haber and his chlorine gas experiments; how the niobium in your cell phone helped finance the brutal Congo wars; an overview of the Bose-Einstein Condensate, the fifth state of matter; Henry Moseley’s electron beam; the alpha constant; why silicon-based life forms are extremely unlikely; Cobalt 60 dirty bombs; Monte Carlo science, itai-itai disease caused by Cadmium poisoning from mining companies on Japan; the role of gadolinium in MRI machines and cancer fighting; the left or right ""handedness"" of proteins; sulfur bacteria and how it relates to the sense of taste; the longest ""word"" ever, a technical term that is too long to be written; why we can unknowingly breathe in nitrogen without gasping for air until we suddenly collapse and die; why idolaters of Gandhi dislike iodine; how a lack of salt in a person suggests the nonexistence of the soul; how brass might be the nugget of truth behind the King Midas myth; how the science of bubbles led to the discovery of radon; and more. As you can see, the scope of this work is vast, possibly too much so. While it is written in a personable, conversational style, I felt that Kean doesn't manage to convey to the meanest scientific intelligence (namely me) a full understanding of the science he uses in the book, such as the aforementioned alpha constant, or how exactly electrons move from their ""shells."" Such information isn't necessary to appreciate the scientific history here, so for me it would have been better off cut entirely if impossible to simplify. I don't need the technical details to approve of a book that tells us that Lewis and Clark's route can be traced by the trace mercury in their feces, or refers to a Mark Twain story in which Satan is depicted as being made of radium, or that Paul McCartney was awarded a rhodium record (rather than gold or platinum) for his unsurpassed sales. That's the stuff that keeps the lay reader in their seats."
310,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Sam Kean has written a witty, interesting book about the elements in the Periodic Table. He writes as if he was chatting with the reader in a coffee shop or a tavern, regaling his friends with one anecdote after another. He's imparting his knowledge of science by the use of quirky, fun facts and interesting stories about the scientists involved.This is not set up like a typical chemistry textbook. The chapters are divided into areas of interest such as astronomy, poisons, money, war, medicine, and periods of history. The author is a physicist so the book had a lot of information about elements made in the lab, radioactive elements, nuclear chemistry, and the atomic bomb. For me, that was the most challenging part of the book.He writes about Linus Pauling's theory of a triple helix being trumped by James Watson and Francis Crick's double helix model of DNA. The attractive Marie Curie was a source of gossip when she took men into dark closets to show them radioactive specimens. Ghandhi told the people of India to dry their own salt instead of paying a British salt tax, only to have many people develop goiter due to lack of iodine. The trail taken by Lewis and Clark is known because anthropologists found (poisonous) mercury capsules that the explorers were using as laxatives. These types of stories make science seem more approachable.The title of the book comes from a practical joke. Gallium, which resembles aluminum, is a solid below 84 degrees F, and can be molded into a spoon. When it is dipped into hot tea, the surprised guest finds the spoon disappearing as it melts away. (Youtube has some ""disappearing spoon"" videos.)This is a book that can be enjoyed by the lay person as well as a scientist. Some chapters will be much easier to understand if a reader has had an introduction to the Periodic Table, such as in a high school Chemistry course. I would have preferred having the footnotes on the bottom of the pages rather than in the back of the book. Overall, the author should be commended for making science fun."
311,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3096541-amy,4,"I have to confess I didn't pay much attention to chemistry. Once the instructor talked about electrons, protons, atoms and the nucleus I usually turned on my Walkman (the cassette kind, now antique!). It never seemed interesting because it wasn't something that related at all to real life. If I had a teacher like Sam Kean, however, that could have been different.Fast forward too many years, and now I'm engrossed in this nonfiction 'memoir' of the Periodic Table of Elements. Like any good biography, this has scandal, lies, fraud, madness, explosions (!!!) and lots of name-dropping. Kean explains just what the periodic table is, but in a format that reads more like a novel, with anecdotal details to liven it up. Mercury pills were used by Lewis and Clark for their health? Yep, and you can trace their path (um, at least their bathroom trips on their journey) by where scientists have found unusually high amounts of mercury in the soil. The poet Robert Lowell? Did lithium ruin his work by making him sane? Who knew the lies and fraud and mind games played by scientists intent on getting a Nobel Prize! There's no getting around it, this is a book that makes you think. It's not simple and it assumes you have a basic knowledge of science. Some areas were over my head, but not for long. Kean is a wonderful teacher with a sassy wise guy voice that livens up any of the deeper areas."
312,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47354-dave,4,"For me this book was a pleasure to listen to. I plan to read a paper or e-book edition shortly. A delightful, an engaging blend of lyrical prose, historic anecdotes and fascinating information. Reminiscent, to me, of some of the writing of Lewis Thomas, Oliver Sacks, Barry Lopez, Edward Abbey and John McPhee.Brain/mind candy or chicken soup for the nerd's soul. Does that make me a dualist?The chapter essays are wide ranging anecdotal expositions of elements and families of elements. Not only stories about the scientists who prospected for and predicted the existence of certain elements, and created schemata for organizing them but about the influence of various elements on cultures, politics, economics and even philosophy. The stories added greatly to my appreciation for and understanding of the lives and work of some well known and some no longer famous scientists. The meditations on peculiar properties of some groups of atoms and alternative arrangements for the Periodic Table bumped my rating of the book from between 4 and 5 stars to clearly 5 stars. Others not so smitten on the history of science and mathematics may find it only mildly interesting or even boring. A must read for nerds, history buffs and fans of creative non-fiction. "
313,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2968341-linda-isakson,5,"I don't normally review non-fiction reads, but this one is just too superb to pass up! A wonderful and engaging read from cover-to-cover. Sam Kean takes the periodic table of the elements, a chart that makes most people cringe at thoughts of high school (or college) chemistry, and turns it into a riveting drama about the table's origins and the hunt to find new elements. Science geeks will love the scientific jargon but you don't need a degree in chemistry to understand the fascinating stories behind the revolutionaries responsible for our modern day technologies. This is definitely a book you can read over and over and still find little morsels you might have previously missed. Kean is amusing, insightful and presents complex information in a very understable package. A must read for fans of scientific history."
314,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18206572-inken,4,"I really enjoyed this book – even the parts I couldn’t understand. I so wish we’d had this as a set text when I took chemistry in high school. Not only might I have understood the rubbish our teacher was spouting, I might’ve liked it and even passed the bloody thing! Nobody ever even bothered to explain the Periodic Table to us and why it looks the way it does. And it's true: watching a gallium spoon dissolve in a glass of water is pretty cool.I had no idea the world of chemistry and physics was such a hotbed of rivalry, gossip and scandal. Delicious stuff."
315,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80835-celeste-ng,0,"Fascinating to me as the daughter of a chemist--I grew up with periodic tables all around, quite literally (I had a periodic table placemat!). Some of these stories were familiar to me, but most were new. Highly recommended for those who want to why the periodic table matters, and to know more about how the elements have changed human lives, sometimes drastically."
316,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40823165-yibbie,1," Never would I have assumed that I would have to quit reading a book about chemistry because of a lewd scene, but I did. In his attempt to introduce us to different chemicals and explain their lives, the author personifies them as characters in a smutty romance. So I quit what was up till then, an interesting book. "
317,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,5,"I’ve been reading a lot of non-fiction lately, and for me, that’s really...well, unusual. If you had asked me a couple of years ago how I felt about non-fiction, I would have described it as eye-glazingly dull, a dry recitation of facts. But now I eagerly scour the non-fiction shelves at the library. I know -- it’s crazy!The only explanation is that non-fiction has gotten better. (It can’t be me that’s changed.) The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean is a fine example of this better, more interesting non-fiction. Kean doesn’t skimp on the facts. He’s packed his book with oodles of information about the elements. What saves his book from being merely a mind-numbing collection of elemental characteristics may be gleaned from the book’s full title: The Disappearing Spoon and Other Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of Elements.Yes, it’s the madness and weirdness that brings the elements to life, and Kean seems to have dug up a fascinating story for virtually every element on the periodic table. For example, the title’s disappearing spoon refers to a (nerdy) practical joke in which unsuspecting victims are given a gallium spoon to stir their tea. I was particularly interested in the stories surrounding the radioactive elements, which ranged from an ex-KGB spy that was murdered with polonium-laced sushi in 2006 to a boy scout that tried to build his own nuclear reactor.Reading non-fiction like this is not only painless, but fun, and I’m convinced that I’m retaining all of those pesky little facts better that I normally would because I’ve so enjoyed learning them. Just wait until we meet at the next dinner party and I regale you with tales of elemental hijinks. If you’ve long despaired of enjoying non-fiction, perhaps now is the time to give it another try. "
318,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,4,"I pretty much knew I was going to like this book as soon as I heard about it. I mean, come on, it's about science! Some of the factoids I learned in this book will stick with me for a long time, like the naturally occurring nuclear reactor in Africa, or the reason why the Washington monument is capped with aluminum. At first I was disappointed that the book had end notes instead of footnotes. I do like footnotes. However, many of them were so long that I understood the reason for it. I ended up just having two bookmarks, one for where I was in the book, and one for where I was in the end notes.On one hand, there were sections that I feel I would have liked better if it hadn't been so long since my last chemistry class. On the other hand, if I were more well-versed in chemistry, some of the stories wouldn't have been so new and interesting to me.There were one or two slow sections in this book, but the interesting sections more than balanced it out. More to the point, this was a book that made me feel smarter for having read it--that goes a long way.One minor quibble that bothered me is that while there were two blank periodic tables which I found quickly, the actual periodic table in the book comes so close to the end that I wasn't able to find it, and I was looking for one. I would have liked to have one to reference. By the time I found it, I was almost done with the book and didn't need it as much. If the periodic table had been printed as an end paper, or in the beginning, or even at the start of the end notes where I could have found it, that would have made it easier to understand some of what the author talked about. After all, it's been a while since high school chemistry, and I only look at that chart periodically. (ha ha)"
319,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1951489-amanda,4,"Think back to your high school chemistry class. Chances are, the artwork adorning the classroom probably contained a poster with the periodic table of the elements. For some reason, all through 7 chemistry classes, my favorite was tungsten.Pop quiz - what is the chemical symbol for tungsten? Why, ""W"" of course! Why not T or Tu or Tg?? The ""W""is for wolfram, the German name for tungsten. Without it, those handy incandescent lightbulbs would not operate if it weren't for those tungsten filaments.I've always had a soft spot for science trivia, and the periodic table of the elements is full of interesting stories. If you have the same soft spot, I'd recommend ""The Disappearing Spoon"" by Sam Keane. The title references a property of the element gallium. Gallium turns from a solid to a liquid at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the author, a favorite prank of grad students is to fashion spoons made of gallium and to hand them out with tea or coffee. The spoon looks like the metal of other silverware, but when used in tea or coffee, melts away - a disappearing spoon!Another reason this is a great book is that it humanizes many of the famous scientists. In reading through textbooks, you never see into the personal lives or professional struggles of the discoveries and constants described in the text. Yet in The Disappearing Spoon, you see the races to get published (discovering and naming rights to elements), the discouragement at being passed up for a Nobel Prize yet again, and how wars and politics shape the or stunt technology."
320,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933518-jason,5,"Sometimes books just fall in my lap....Although I do pretty much put myself in a position where they seem to fall from the sky at a brisk rate. I went to Barnes & Noble the other day with the wife, ostensibly to get a cup of coffee, and picked up this book and Jose Saramago's 'The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'. I couldn't tell you what it was about it that caught my attention. I'm doing that thing again where I read too many books at once, but despite my inward pleas to the contrary, I couldn't resist picking it up and starting to read. What a great book. Refreshing, endlessly intriguing. Every page was a pleasure. Basically a book like this tells me two things: what a whiny spoiled brat I am, and what a complete dimwitted ape I am. In these pages I read about a woman who rode horseback for 1200 miles through a Russian winter to get her kid to a college only to see him rejected, and she then rode 400 more miles to get him to yet another school after which she promptly, and understandably, died. That's just so Russian. Then I read about a man who not only invented the Bunsen burner, he also invented the Spectrometer, and subsequently discovered several new elements, all in the 1850s. I look at myself and realize I'm liable to get suicidal if we run out of half and half, and my greatest achievement in life has been to arrange The Police's 'Roxanne' for the ukulele. Sometimes a good dose of perspective is extremely illuminating. "
321,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3387843-celine,4,"Did you love it when your teacher told funny science anecdotes? Then The Disappearing Spoon might be the book for you.This book is exactly what it is made out to be. With a full title of The Disappearing Spoon And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, it tells you everything you should know. Kean starts with the periodic table, talks about how it was created, and from there, tells of fun, tragic, or interesting stories about all of the elements.Most of the science in The Disappearing Spoon is understandable with a high-school knowledge of chemistry. But even if you don't know enough chemistry, those parts can easily be skipped. Most of the book is heavily inspired by scientific history, rather than science itself. If you want to know more about the bickering and rivalries between chemists, this book is perfect. The Disappearing Spoon is highly entertaining, and it's clear the author has done extensive research into the lives of the scientists he talks about. My only gripe is that he has the tendency to lose direction sometimes, and flounders between all of the threads of stories he started, no longer clear on exactly what point he wanted to make. "
322,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,1,"I need to make a new shelf for this one and books like it...read, mostly. This is at times a ""cute book"" but in spite of it's promise it will help you if you have a deep abiding love of chemistry before you crack it open.It doesn't really appear to be organized all that well and isn't truly geared to the average reader. He opens up with his early fascination with mercury (the element, not the planet or the mythological deity) and how it led him into literature etc. Then he sets out to induce us all into the wonder/wonders that is/are the periodic table. I wasn't drawn into chemistry beyond what's required in high school, neither was I here. It didn't work, I lost interest quickly and wasn't interested in going on with the class.Enjoy if it's cup of tea...not mine. Maybe you'll like it, but I can't recommend it."
323,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"A fun read, for a certain value of fun. This is a book for science geeks, or those curious about science. If you're a full-fledged science geek, this could be a relatively light side read. If you're more of a layman, it's an opportunity to read some science that shouldn't be too far over your head, most of the time. I fall in the latter category. I wouldn't exactly call this a light read (though it's certainly easier going than some books that I've attempted) but the personable tone and fascinating stories kept me interested even when the going got a little tough. For a more science literate reader, those same stories would probably make it easier to get through the more familiar territory without getting bored. So yes, I did have fun, and I learned a few things, and I gave my brain a bit of a workout. Which is exactly what I like to see in a book about science."
324,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,3,"Since I have ditched my chemical engineering degree for a (once shiny) computer science one, whenever I see books like these I tend to gravitate towards them in pure nostalgia and consume them with a single minded passion. This book especially incited fond memories from my college days when we were consuming chemistry and its historical progress. I still have my periodic table poster that hung next to my bed for a good part of last decade. It was fun to read anecdotes, vignettes and author's own dealings with elements. The writing is casual, occasionally whimsical, terribly nostalgic and overall interesting. Though Kean refrains from overt use of technical jargon, it just isn't possible to escape it completely. With a dose of nostalgia, I enjoyed reading this."
325,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5984690-sean-o,5,"One of the top non-fiction books I've read this year. It's full of exactly the kind of stories I like: scientists and other clever people finding out about the universe. This one is all about the Periodic Table of Elements, and stories about every single element. Some get star treatment, but even ultra-rare Francium gets a shout out. The science is good and the writer doesn't dumb things down too much. He also makes excellent use of foot notes which provide great asides as well as jumping off points for further reading. "
326,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999881-geoff,3,This book is filled with stories about the discoveries of the elements of the periodic table - some I knew and many I had never heard before. 
327,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"This is a relatively slim book, but it’s packed with super interesting stories you never learned in chemistry, like:1) Scientists tracked the path of Lewis & Clark across America by looking for mercury deposits. The party took mercury tablets to “cure” ailments, and wherever they went #2, they left mercury in the soil2) 7 different elements were discovered in Ytterby, a tiny suburban town in Sweden3) the elements in the periodic table haven’t always been around: originally, there was just hydrogen. Through a variety of reactions, hydrogen (the simplest element) produced all other elements on the periodic table in our solar system. (This makes me wonder: what do other solar systems look like, elementally? Did they experience the same reactions yielding the same elements, or an entirely different set?)4) the creator of the death gas used in WW2 concentration camps, Zyklon B (well, the first version anyway, named Zyklon A—it got slightly tweaked) was Franz Haber, a Jewish man famous for killing many Allied soldiers in painful chemical ways during WWI. Zyklon B was later used to murder thousands of people, including Haber’s own relatives5) Two elements called niobium and tantalum (named after Niobe and Tantalus from Greek myth) are found in the the Congo, combined in a rock called coltan. Niobium and tantalum are metals used in cell phones. The huge demand for coltan in the late 1990s/early 2000s caused anarchy and devastation in the Congo6) A scientist named Seaborg who worked on the Manhattan Project discovered the elements americium (which powers smoke detectors, by the way) and curium in 1946. Rather than announcing it in a scientific journal, Seaborg announced it on a children’s show, Quiz Kids (a child asked Seaborg if he’d discovered any new elements lately, and he explained that he had; judging by the mail he received from schoolchildren, teachers across the globe refused to believe the children’s claims the next week in school)7) the first antibacterial drug wasn’t penicillin (the first antibiotic)—in 1932, a man named Domagk discovered that Prontosil, an industrial dye, could be injected into a sick person to cure them of a bacterial infection (Domagk initially made this discovery on mice; when his daughter Hildegarde tripped while holding a sewing needle and acquired a life-threatening infection, Domagk gave it a whirl in humans, and she got better)8) Tellurium smells strongly of garlic. Beryllium tastes like sugar (despite being a toxic metal). Potassium tastes like salt!9) the European Union, appropriately, uses europium in the ink on euros to show they’re not counterfeit10) In the African nation of Gabon, there exists the only natural nuclear fission reactor known to exist, called Oklo—fueled by uranium, blue-green algae (pond scum), and plain water (the only reason there’s not a gigantic hole burned into Gabon? When the uranium reaches critical mass, it boils off the water, and without the water, the reaction stops). My favourite chapter was chapter 9 (on poisonous elements) because poison is cool. I was especially interested in how a local doctor (Noboru Hagino) discovered that cadmium was poisoning the people of Kamioka, Japan: with the help of a public health professor, he plotted the homes of all the people who came down with the mysterious disease (known as itai-itai, or “ouch ouch” disease), and was able to discover that they all lived along the Jinzu River, which carried cadmium, a waste product from the local mine. This reminded me a lot of The Ghost Map, which, as in the case of Kamioka, tells the story of how a local doctor and a public health professional teamed up to trace the root of a deadly disease (cholera, in that case) using mapping. (Speaking of London—I was also interested to see Alexander Litvinenko, murdered by polonium-spiked tea in a London sushi restaurant, get a mention; I recently saw his grave in Highgate Cemetery). Definitely a fun read if you have a spare afternoon and wish you knew the more fun side of chemistry."
328,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4053034-laura,1,"I didn't finish this book. I couldn't finish this book because the parts of this book that are about science I know could most generously be described as ""missleading at best"". If that's the case about the stuff I know, how much is true in the stuff I don't know? I'm called upon to teach some chemistry despite the fact my real chemistry knowledge pretty much ends at physical chemistry and astrochemistry - so I really don't need to fill my head with stories and theories that are pale reflections of the current state of knowledge when I don't read enough of the literature to judge how correct they are.I'm not sure where the author looked up the theory of solar system formation he gives in Chapter 4, but it wasn't in anything written in the last 20 years. If he'd turned in what's written here on an astronomy exam when I was in a generous mood I might give him a point or two for having a couple of right ideas in there, but he'd still have an F.I started to get a clue there was a problem when the author called the collision of comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 (1993 F2) with Jupiter ""intergalactic"". Huh? How is the collision of two solar system objects intergalactic? There's no evidence that SL9 was an extra-solar comet, much less an extra-galactic comet, but ok, he's using an odd hyperbole to make it sound more exciting. Overall the book has a very bubbly, casual style to it so I'll let him use this oddly chosen word. Things get worse however, when he implies Jupiter is the reason C/Hale-Bopp (1995 O1) came into the inner solar system. At this point I'm still assuming he knows that is not true and he's wording things really poorly, but I'm beginning to doubt I know enough of the science in other parts of the book to be able to see through this sort of thing elsewhere. However, it's when he writes ""Because the stellar wind blew only the lightest, most common elements as far out as Jupiter, it should have the same basic elemental composition as real stars"", that I pause and make a WTF!?! note in the margin. It takes me half a lecture or more to explain our current understanding of solar system formation, so I won't go through it all in this review, but the above is pure nonsense. More pure nonsense occurs when he mentions that the cloud of gas and dust our solar system formed out of was flat. There's no evidence for that and it's extremely unlikely dynamically. Simple physics flattens any shape of cloud collapsing under gravity to a spinning disk.Coming back to the missleading at best parts, we are told there are apparently mini-nuclear booms in stars counterbalancing gravity rather than thermal pressure. Booms implies a series of nuclear bombs going off when it is actually the steady rate of fusion in the interior of the Sun that causes the thermal pressure that balances gravity. Finally, given that I'm a planetary scientist, I just can't let slide the description of the Moon forming due to an ""asteroid or comet impact"". Well ok. If you want to call a roughly Mars sized planetesimal an asteroid or comet. However, there aren't any Mars sized planetesimals left that we'd call an asteroid or comet today. Mars is really in no danger of being demoted from planet-hood.I haven't picked on every problem with the astrophysics presented in this chapter, but all this and more brings me to the end of Chapter 4 with no trust the author knows anything about what he's talking about. This is likely not true given all the glowing reviews, one even appearing in the well respected journal Nature (I'm guessing a review by a chemist that knew no astronomy?). But having lost my trust it can't be regained, and I won't be finishing this book."
329,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9255064-melissa,4,"Chemistry has never been my thing. I hated it in high school (except for the part where we melted mechanical pencils over the Bunsen burner). Recently watching the chemistry Crash Course episodes has reminded me that chemistry is not just the boring science class I struggled to stay awake through in high school. Chemistry is everything around us and understanding a bit about it will help me better understand the way the world works.So I picked up The Disappearing Spoon with that in mind and was richly rewarded. Kean’s writing style was fun and made the subject matter interesting. He talks not only about the science behind each element, but about the scientists who discovered them and the impact they had on the world. For example Mendeleev, who is credited with creating the Periodic Table, had a fascinating start. He was born in Siberia, the youngest of 11 children. His father died when he was only 13 and his mother worked incredibly hard to give him the chance to go to school. Imagine having to overcome all of those things just to be able to go to school! Another favorite of mine was Marie Curie. Her fascinating life, including a marriage that was far ahead of its time and the discovery of multiple elements was so interesting. She won a Nobel Prize in a time when women in America weren’t even allowed to vote. I would love to a biography that focused solely on her.The periodic table has changed the world in both positive and negative ways. Kean doesn’t shy away from the damage that’s been done because of the discovery of a new element. He talks about the effects of vaccinations and medicines and also at the way chemistry made things like the atom bomb possible. When cell phones became wildly popular in the 1990s the fight to find more of the metal used to create them caused the Congo to explode with fighting. People were in a frenzy to provide the metal that was in such high demand. “Overall more than 5 million people have died in Congo since the mid-1990s, making it the biggest waste of life since World War II. The fighting there is proof that in addition to all the uplifting moments the Periodic table has inspired it can also play on humankind's worst, most inhumane instincts.”This balanced look at the Table reminds us that with great knowledge (just like great power) comes great responsibility. Almost any scientific advance can be used for good or bad and there will always be a struggle to use it correctly. BOTTOM LINE: The most interesting book I’ve read ever read about chemistry and one that kept me intrigued the entire time. We live in a truly remarkable world and I’ll never regret reading a book that opens up a new corner of that world to me."

I'm definitely the right audience for this book: someone who knows some chemistry but didn't get any higher degrees in it, and is more interested in the historical, cultural building of the periodic table than the hard science.Kean's wry prose never lets you forget that his point of view is subjective and conversational: he paints caricatures of famous scientists and makes ridiculous analogies. His audience is undoubtedly American. He does his best to explain concepts (some of which I still remembered!) in layman's terms, though I kind of dozed off at the discussion of alpha. He does a good job giving awesome lady scientists their due, like Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin, Maria Groppert-Mayer and Marie Curie. I learned a bunch of things, how thallium is the worst ever poison (the poisoner's poison) and that cobalt-60 is the dirtiest and worst ever a-bomb. The structuring of the elements grouped into chapters, chapters grouped into parts, gave the book a flow and rhythm. It might have benefited from a longer conclusion.This book has made me feel like the biggest dork ever, because when people mention some element now, I have to squash the impulse to say, ""Hey! Did you know that...""The Disappearing Spoon also showed to me what my chemistry, biology and physics teachers in high school and college never did: how magical, weird, wonderful, temperamental, dangerous and dramatic science can be, how they're heterogeneously mixed with Romance and politics. I wish I'd had this book in high school."
331,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19832185-thomas-frank,4,"As someone who never took chemistry, I found this book to provide just enough of the basics about the periodic table to enable me to sound at least a bit better than completely ignorant when talking about the subject. Beyond that, it's filled with interesting stories about the people who helped build the table and discover many of its elements, as well as other events that revolve around said elements. I particularly enjoyed the one about Germany's clandestine operations in the U.S. during WWI.One nitpick I had with this book: Every 2-3 pages, you'll find an asterisk that corresponds to a footnote in the back of the book. I'm the kind of person who simply cannot ignore these, and as a result, constantly going to the back of the book to read them made it a bit harder for me to immerse myself in the main text. Now, this is mainly the fault of my own brain, so I'm not subtracting anything from my score for it. Just be aware of this fact if you happen to be like me. Personally, I think the footnotes would have been less distracting if they were put on the actual page where they were referenced.Still, this book was really enjoyable. I look forward to digging into Kean's newer works when I've got some time."

Subtitle: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the ElementsWho could have imagined such a volume written about that chart that hangs in every high school chemistry classroom? I’m an admitted science geek. I loved the “Mr Wizard” TV show when I was a kid. (He encouraged us to perform all sorts of experiments using our mother’s kitchen utensils and supplies.) I never wanted a Barbie doll, I wanted a chemistry set and a microscope! So, I’ve had this book on my TBR list since it first came out. And I have to say that I’m a little disappointed.It’s not that Kean is a bad writer; he isn’t, and he’s quite thorough in exploring this topic. His enthusiasm and fascination for the periodic table comes through. But, it was just too much even for this science geek. Some parts were far more interesting to me than others. I loved the chapter on poisons, for example. I was less enthralled with the political infighting on what name to give to a newly discovered element. Also, I made the choice to listen to the audio format. Sean Runnette did a fine job of performing the audio. However, the sometimes dry subject matter made for a more difficult listening experience. I might have enjoyed this more in text."
333,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3349963-craig-cottingham,4,"I was a chemical engineering major in college, so some of the background information (like the basics of the periodic table) was familiar to me and therefore a little tedious to read. Outside of that, however, this was a fascinating book that I think would be accessible to non-beakerheads.Each chapter is devoted to a group of elements that are related. Instead of going for the obvious groupings (the inert gasses, the halogens, etc.) he comes at them from a refreshingly sideways direction. There's a chapter on poisons (from the obvious like arsenic, to thallium, which was responsible for thousands of deaths from contaminated groundwater in Japan) and another on measurements (from the international standard kilogram, which is an ingot of iridium, to the cesium-powered atomic clocks which define the international standard second). Each one reads a little like an episode of James Burke's TV series Connections, the way the discussion of one element blends into another. Sometimes the connections and the groupings are a little contrived, but not jarringly so, and I'm sure it was necessary to avoid a ""here are all the elements that didn't fit in anywhere else"" chapter.Highly recommended."
334,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"There’s a lot packed into this book. I enjoyed the look of the history of the periodic table; how it got started, the changes made over time, the discoveries of elements. Intermingled are the stories of the people; the scientists who figured things out and made things happen. Intertwined yet again are the stories of the theory and workings of atoms; what makes them tick, what makes them unique, what makes them react. Then there’s all those scientists; some humorous, some deceitful or crazy for fame. I really enjoyed the bit about the periodic table in the future and how the table if ever-changing and expanding. This is a wonderful book for those who enjoy chemistry, physics and anything “earthy”. "
335,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Fun romp through the periodic table - lots of chemistry and physics, but even more stories about science and the people who do it. Sam Kean has fun with history. The book is not very technical, but approachable and occasionally humorous. The stories are diverse - there are many elements on the table, so we jump around quite a bit. I enjoyed this on audio, found it both educational and entertaining, but I probably won’t remember much as there is no common storyline other than the stories being about elements."
336,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,2,"Uneven and only fitfully engaging, The Disappearing Spoon is less a history of the periodic table and how scientists have come to understand elemental matter than it is a collection of facts about those elements and anecdotes about the various researchers who've discovered them. Sam Kean doesn't really have the knack for explaining (or re-explaining) scientific concepts to people who haven't studied chemistry or physics since secondary school, and relies too much on clunky metaphors and irritating anthropomorphisms. (For example, Kean writes that stars are ""[d]esperate to maintain high temperatures."" Stars are not sentient. They do not have feelings. Even more jaw-droppingly asinine, though, are sentences like ""In addition to Haber's being a Jew, Germany excommunicated him because he had become passé."" Do I need to break down why this is, at an absolute minimum, a tacky way of putting things?) He never actually fully explains how the periodic table works.More damningly to me, as a historian, is that Kean tries to write from a perspective which is determinedly presentist. His interest in the past seems to primarily stem from wanting to know the backstory of the discovery and refinement of certain scientific concepts, rather than any desire to engage with the history of science as an evolving conceptual system which is inevitably shaped by those who practice it. For a man who seems fascinated by the universe on scales both macro and micro, Kean seems profoundly uninterested in the human."
337,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"What Neil DeGrasse Tyson does for astronomy and David Attenborough does for zoology, Sam Kean does for chemistry and physics TOGETHER. There were a few times when the author simplified technical explanations, which I think made it more confusing. For that reason, I almost gave this book a 4. However there were enough moments where my mind was completely blown that I decided it had to be a 5. The first chapter is boring, but it is well worth pushing through. (What is it with science and very boring first chapters. Always. Start with something that draws me in for cryin' out loud!) There is a fascinating chapter on elements in times of war (Gold? Who needs gold? Give me molybdenum and tungsten.) and of course causing wars. A chapter that delves into lasers and masers (Holy shit, this was awesome! Seriously? How did I not know how lasers work? How did I learn all of the basic principles in physics, but I never learned how they come together in the most fantastic, brilliant way? I am happy to have rectified this situation.) and also the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a newish state of matter where a few thousand atoms becomes ""one giant marshmallow"" of an atom-a singularity and on a macro scale. This chapter ends with:""As technology keeps improving, scientists have gotten better and better at inducing matter to form the BEC. It's not like anyone's taking orders yet, but scientists might soon be able to build 'matter lasers' that shoot out ultra-focused beams of atoms thousands of times more powerful that light lasers, or construct 'supersolid' ice cubes that CAN FLOW THROUGH EACH OTHER WITHOUT LOSING THEIR SOLIDITY [emphasis mine]."" If I were a science teacher, the very next thing I would do after teaching this is have my students write a sci-fi story touching on where this technology is going next. What's it like to live in a world where solids can flow through each other? I know it's impossibly silly, but I immediately imagined humans that can walk through walls and stuff like that. Of course, this only happens at way below zero temperatures and on a very small scale. But you know, a girl can dream. There's also a chapter called ""Poisoner's Corridor: 'Ouch-Ouch'."" No need to elaborate. There's a chapter on elements as currency and of course fraud. There's even a section on how elements deceive our sense of taste-fascinating! (An example- chewing potassium gymnemate will make raw sugar heaped on your tongue taste like sand)Some other awesome tidbits:The person who discovered x-rays thought he went mad when he first saw the bones of his hands and a key hidden in a book. ""The primary component of taste, smell, is the only sense that bypasses our logical neural processing and connects directly to the brain's emotional centers.""""And whereas electrons absorb and emit light of the same color (yellow in, yellow out), fluorescent molecules absorb high-energy light (ultraviolet light) but emit that energy as lower-energy, visible light."" That's why we can see scorpions glow in the dark under black lights! This is what makes UV visible to us! The most powerful lasers today can produce beams that for a fraction of a second produce more power than the whole United States.Seriously, this book goes all over the place, but still manages to be organized. Loved it! "
338,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie,3,"""The Disappearing Spoon"" teaches the chemistry and physics of atoms and the periodic table. It's taught primarily in the context of short biographies about the Noble prize winning scientists (plus some others) who discovered the various elements or who discovered important things about how the elements or atoms are put together.Based on the book description I was given, I was expecting more trivia about the elements and how they are and have been used rather than a book teaching science with a main focus on scientists. However, the author's casual, lively, and sometimes crude tone made the stories entertaining--probably even more so to young males than to me. I did get a little tired of the author's judgmental attitude, though. It seemed like every human action had to be either brilliant or insanely stupid.The author's explanations of how things worked (atoms, periodic table, etc.) were easy for me to follow, but that might partly be because I took a lot of science courses in college. The initial science lessons were high school level, but the ending lessons were more college level (though high schoolers can probably follow them).The book primarily focused on science and scientists, but there were a few stories of invention, greed, destruction or just plain weirdness based around non-scientists. Though I didn't actually check to make sure, it seemed like every element on the periodic table was covered at least briefly. Some of the areas in which he discussed the use of the elements were warfare (chemical warfare, nuclear bombs, dirty bombs), medicine, politics, art, biology (especially DNA), as poison, as money (counterfeiting, a strange gold rush), and under super-cool conditions. He also covered a Big Bang model of how the elements were formed (with a ""see, no god needed!"" emphasis), how radiometric dating methods were thought up and used to generate dates for the age of the Earth that were old enough to give biological evolution a chance of occurring (since previous dating methods gave too ""young"" of an age to allow for it), and how biases can prevent critical viewing of scientific data (though he didn't seem to notice his own bias).He worked a lot of ""there is no God, humans & Earth aren't special, and evolution is true"" apologetics into this book. I wouldn't mind so much if, in the appendix, he hadn't presented what ""young-earth creationists believe"" by mixing true statements with misrepresented and apparently ridiculous ones as well as completely inaccurate ones. So now, if these readers come across the true argument, they'll dismiss it without really considering it--they'll think they know all about it when they don't.There were a few black and white photographs of scientists and a few charts. Overall, the book was entertaining and interesting, though not so much so that I'd want to read it again. The people who'd be most interested by it are probably teen or college age males who idolize science as pure and untarnished but who also like somewhat scandalous tales about scientists, their competitions to make Noble-winning discoveries, and their fights over who made a discovery first.I received this Advanced Reader Copy for review purposes from the publisher. "
339,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author relates many anecdotes of the discovery and uses of several elements with (as he says about those who know the periodic table) ""dweeby nonchalance.” It is meant to be a readable, interesting book of popular science for the lay reader, and indeed it is full of fascinating anecdotes about all things elemental. (The titular spoon is made of gallium, metal that melts in low temperatures and therefore a spoon made of it dissolves in tea. Ha ha, periodic table practical jokes!) Based on the title alone, I expected a lot of anecdotes such as the battle over the molybdenum mine in Colorado during WWII to help the Nazi war effort, or endless spats over naming rights of elements, but this book contains so much more. The madman Fritz Haber and his chlorine gas experiments; how the niobium in your cell phone helped finance the brutal Congo wars; an overview of the Bose-Einstein Condensate, the fifth state of matter; Henry Moseley’s electron beam; the alpha constant; why silicon-based life forms are extremely unlikely; Cobalt 60 dirty bombs; Monte Carlo science, itai-itai disease caused by Cadmium poisoning from mining companies on Japan; the role of gadolinium in MRI machines and cancer fighting; the left or right ""handedness"" of proteins; sulfur bacteria and how it relates to the sense of taste; the longest ""word"" ever, a technical term that is too long to be written; why we can unknowingly breathe in nitrogen without gasping for air until we suddenly collapse and die; why idolaters of Gandhi dislike iodine; how a lack of salt in a person suggests the nonexistence of the soul; how brass might be the nugget of truth behind the King Midas myth; how the science of bubbles led to the discovery of radon; and more. As you can see, the scope of this work is vast, possibly too much so. While it is written in a personable, conversational style, I felt that Kean doesn't manage to convey to the meanest scientific intelligence (namely me) a full understanding of the science he uses in the book, such as the aforementioned alpha constant, or how exactly electrons move from their ""shells."" Such information isn't necessary to appreciate the scientific history here, so for me it would have been better off cut entirely if impossible to simplify. I don't need the technical details to approve of a book that tells us that Lewis and Clark's route can be traced by the trace mercury in their feces, or refers to a Mark Twain story in which Satan is depicted as being made of radium, or that Paul McCartney was awarded a rhodium record (rather than gold or platinum) for his unsurpassed sales. That's the stuff that keeps the lay reader in their seats."
340,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Sam Kean has written a witty, interesting book about the elements in the Periodic Table. He writes as if he was chatting with the reader in a coffee shop or a tavern, regaling his friends with one anecdote after another. He's imparting his knowledge of science by the use of quirky, fun facts and interesting stories about the scientists involved.This is not set up like a typical chemistry textbook. The chapters are divided into areas of interest such as astronomy, poisons, money, war, medicine, and periods of history. The author is a physicist so the book had a lot of information about elements made in the lab, radioactive elements, nuclear chemistry, and the atomic bomb. For me, that was the most challenging part of the book.He writes about Linus Pauling's theory of a triple helix being trumped by James Watson and Francis Crick's double helix model of DNA. The attractive Marie Curie was a source of gossip when she took men into dark closets to show them radioactive specimens. Ghandhi told the people of India to dry their own salt instead of paying a British salt tax, only to have many people develop goiter due to lack of iodine. The trail taken by Lewis and Clark is known because anthropologists found (poisonous) mercury capsules that the explorers were using as laxatives. These types of stories make science seem more approachable.The title of the book comes from a practical joke. Gallium, which resembles aluminum, is a solid below 84 degrees F, and can be molded into a spoon. When it is dipped into hot tea, the surprised guest finds the spoon disappearing as it melts away. (Youtube has some ""disappearing spoon"" videos.)This is a book that can be enjoyed by the lay person as well as a scientist. Some chapters will be much easier to understand if a reader has had an introduction to the Periodic Table, such as in a high school Chemistry course. I would have preferred having the footnotes on the bottom of the pages rather than in the back of the book. Overall, the author should be commended for making science fun."
341,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3096541-amy,4,"I have to confess I didn't pay much attention to chemistry. Once the instructor talked about electrons, protons, atoms and the nucleus I usually turned on my Walkman (the cassette kind, now antique!). It never seemed interesting because it wasn't something that related at all to real life. If I had a teacher like Sam Kean, however, that could have been different.Fast forward too many years, and now I'm engrossed in this nonfiction 'memoir' of the Periodic Table of Elements. Like any good biography, this has scandal, lies, fraud, madness, explosions (!!!) and lots of name-dropping. Kean explains just what the periodic table is, but in a format that reads more like a novel, with anecdotal details to liven it up. Mercury pills were used by Lewis and Clark for their health? Yep, and you can trace their path (um, at least their bathroom trips on their journey) by where scientists have found unusually high amounts of mercury in the soil. The poet Robert Lowell? Did lithium ruin his work by making him sane? Who knew the lies and fraud and mind games played by scientists intent on getting a Nobel Prize! There's no getting around it, this is a book that makes you think. It's not simple and it assumes you have a basic knowledge of science. Some areas were over my head, but not for long. Kean is a wonderful teacher with a sassy wise guy voice that livens up any of the deeper areas."
342,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47354-dave,4,"For me this book was a pleasure to listen to. I plan to read a paper or e-book edition shortly. A delightful, an engaging blend of lyrical prose, historic anecdotes and fascinating information. Reminiscent, to me, of some of the writing of Lewis Thomas, Oliver Sacks, Barry Lopez, Edward Abbey and John McPhee.Brain/mind candy or chicken soup for the nerd's soul. Does that make me a dualist?The chapter essays are wide ranging anecdotal expositions of elements and families of elements. Not only stories about the scientists who prospected for and predicted the existence of certain elements, and created schemata for organizing them but about the influence of various elements on cultures, politics, economics and even philosophy. The stories added greatly to my appreciation for and understanding of the lives and work of some well known and some no longer famous scientists. The meditations on peculiar properties of some groups of atoms and alternative arrangements for the Periodic Table bumped my rating of the book from between 4 and 5 stars to clearly 5 stars. Others not so smitten on the history of science and mathematics may find it only mildly interesting or even boring. A must read for nerds, history buffs and fans of creative non-fiction. "
343,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2968341-linda-isakson,5,"I don't normally review non-fiction reads, but this one is just too superb to pass up! A wonderful and engaging read from cover-to-cover. Sam Kean takes the periodic table of the elements, a chart that makes most people cringe at thoughts of high school (or college) chemistry, and turns it into a riveting drama about the table's origins and the hunt to find new elements. Science geeks will love the scientific jargon but you don't need a degree in chemistry to understand the fascinating stories behind the revolutionaries responsible for our modern day technologies. This is definitely a book you can read over and over and still find little morsels you might have previously missed. Kean is amusing, insightful and presents complex information in a very understable package. A must read for fans of scientific history."
344,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18206572-inken,4,"I really enjoyed this book – even the parts I couldn’t understand. I so wish we’d had this as a set text when I took chemistry in high school. Not only might I have understood the rubbish our teacher was spouting, I might’ve liked it and even passed the bloody thing! Nobody ever even bothered to explain the Periodic Table to us and why it looks the way it does. And it's true: watching a gallium spoon dissolve in a glass of water is pretty cool.I had no idea the world of chemistry and physics was such a hotbed of rivalry, gossip and scandal. Delicious stuff."
345,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80835-celeste-ng,0,"Fascinating to me as the daughter of a chemist--I grew up with periodic tables all around, quite literally (I had a periodic table placemat!). Some of these stories were familiar to me, but most were new. Highly recommended for those who want to why the periodic table matters, and to know more about how the elements have changed human lives, sometimes drastically."

In his attempt to introduce us to different chemicals and explain their lives, the author personifies them as characters in a smutty romance. So I quit what was up till then, an interesting book. "
347,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,5,"I’ve been reading a lot of non-fiction lately, and for me, that’s really...well, unusual. If you had asked me a couple of years ago how I felt about non-fiction, I would have described it as eye-glazingly dull, a dry recitation of facts. But now I eagerly scour the non-fiction shelves at the library. I know -- it’s crazy!The only explanation is that non-fiction has gotten better. (It can’t be me that’s changed.) The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean is a fine example of this better, more interesting non-fiction. Kean doesn’t skimp on the facts. He’s packed his book with oodles of information about the elements. What saves his book from being merely a mind-numbing collection of elemental characteristics may be gleaned from the book’s full title: The Disappearing Spoon and Other Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of Elements.Yes, it’s the madness and weirdness that brings the elements to life, and Kean seems to have dug up a fascinating story for virtually every element on the periodic table. For example, the title’s disappearing spoon refers to a (nerdy) practical joke in which unsuspecting victims are given a gallium spoon to stir their tea. I was particularly interested in the stories surrounding the radioactive elements, which ranged from an ex-KGB spy that was murdered with polonium-laced sushi in 2006 to a boy scout that tried to build his own nuclear reactor.Reading non-fiction like this is not only painless, but fun, and I’m convinced that I’m retaining all of those pesky little facts better that I normally would because I’ve so enjoyed learning them. Just wait until we meet at the next dinner party and I regale you with tales of elemental hijinks. If you’ve long despaired of enjoying non-fiction, perhaps now is the time to give it another try. "
348,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,4,"I pretty much knew I was going to like this book as soon as I heard about it. I mean, come on, it's about science! Some of the factoids I learned in this book will stick with me for a long time, like the naturally occurring nuclear reactor in Africa, or the reason why the Washington monument is capped with aluminum. At first I was disappointed that the book had end notes instead of footnotes. I do like footnotes. However, many of them were so long that I understood the reason for it. I ended up just having two bookmarks, one for where I was in the book, and one for where I was in the end notes.On one hand, there were sections that I feel I would have liked better if it hadn't been so long since my last chemistry class. On the other hand, if I were more well-versed in chemistry, some of the stories wouldn't have been so new and interesting to me.There were one or two slow sections in this book, but the interesting sections more than balanced it out. More to the point, this was a book that made me feel smarter for having read it--that goes a long way.One minor quibble that bothered me is that while there were two blank periodic tables which I found quickly, the actual periodic table in the book comes so close to the end that I wasn't able to find it, and I was looking for one. I would have liked to have one to reference. By the time I found it, I was almost done with the book and didn't need it as much. If the periodic table had been printed as an end paper, or in the beginning, or even at the start of the end notes where I could have found it, that would have made it easier to understand some of what the author talked about. After all, it's been a while since high school chemistry, and I only look at that chart periodically. (ha ha)"
349,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1951489-amanda,4,"Think back to your high school chemistry class. Chances are, the artwork adorning the classroom probably contained a poster with the periodic table of the elements. For some reason, all through 7 chemistry classes, my favorite was tungsten.Pop quiz - what is the chemical symbol for tungsten? Why, ""W"" of course! Why not T or Tu or Tg?? The ""W""is for wolfram, the German name for tungsten. Without it, those handy incandescent lightbulbs would not operate if it weren't for those tungsten filaments.I've always had a soft spot for science trivia, and the periodic table of the elements is full of interesting stories. If you have the same soft spot, I'd recommend ""The Disappearing Spoon"" by Sam Keane. The title references a property of the element gallium. Gallium turns from a solid to a liquid at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the author, a favorite prank of grad students is to fashion spoons made of gallium and to hand them out with tea or coffee. The spoon looks like the metal of other silverware, but when used in tea or coffee, melts away - a disappearing spoon!Another reason this is a great book is that it humanizes many of the famous scientists. In reading through textbooks, you never see into the personal lives or professional struggles of the discoveries and constants described in the text. Yet in The Disappearing Spoon, you see the races to get published (discovering and naming rights to elements), the discouragement at being passed up for a Nobel Prize yet again, and how wars and politics shape the or stunt technology."

I went to Barnes & Noble the other day with the wife, ostensibly to get a cup of coffee, and picked up this book and Jose Saramago's 'The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'. I couldn't tell you what it was about it that caught my attention. I'm doing that thing again where I read too many books at once, but despite my inward pleas to the contrary, I couldn't resist picking it up and starting to read. What a great book. Refreshing, endlessly intriguing. Every page was a pleasure. Basically a book like this tells me two things: what a whiny spoiled brat I am, and what a complete dimwitted ape I am. In these pages I read about a woman who rode horseback for 1200 miles through a Russian winter to get her kid to a college only to see him rejected, and she then rode 400 more miles to get him to yet another school after which she promptly, and understandably, died. That's just so Russian. Then I read about a man who not only invented the Bunsen burner, he also invented the Spectrometer, and subsequently discovered several new elements, all in the 1850s. I look at myself and realize I'm liable to get suicidal if we run out of half and half, and my greatest achievement in life has been to arrange The Police's 'Roxanne' for the ukulele. Sometimes a good dose of perspective is extremely illuminating. "

Then The Disappearing Spoon might be the book for you.This book is exactly what it is made out to be. With a full title of The Disappearing Spoon And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, it tells you everything you should know. Kean starts with the periodic table, talks about how it was created, and from there, tells of fun, tragic, or interesting stories about all of the elements.Most of the science in The Disappearing Spoon is understandable with a high-school knowledge of chemistry. But even if you don't know enough chemistry, those parts can easily be skipped. Most of the book is heavily inspired by scientific history, rather than science itself. If you want to know more about the bickering and rivalries between chemists, this book is perfect. The Disappearing Spoon is highly entertaining, and it's clear the author has done extensive research into the lives of the scientists he talks about. My only gripe is that he has the tendency to lose direction sometimes, and flounders between all of the threads of stories he started, no longer clear on exactly what point he wanted to make. "

This is at times a ""cute book"" but in spite of it's promise it will help you if you have a deep abiding love of chemistry before you crack it open.It doesn't really appear to be organized all that well and isn't truly geared to the average reader. He opens up with his early fascination with mercury (the element, not the planet or the mythological deity) and how it led him into literature etc. Then he sets out to induce us all into the wonder/wonders that is/are the periodic table. I wasn't drawn into chemistry beyond what's required in high school, neither was I here. It didn't work, I lost interest quickly and wasn't interested in going on with the class.Enjoy if it's cup of tea...not mine. Maybe you'll like it, but I can't recommend it."

If you're a full-fledged science geek, this could be a relatively light side read. If you're more of a layman, it's an opportunity to read some science that shouldn't be too far over your head, most of the time. I fall in the latter category. I wouldn't exactly call this a light read (though it's certainly easier going than some books that I've attempted) but the personable tone and fascinating stories kept me interested even when the going got a little tough. For a more science literate reader, those same stories would probably make it easier to get through the more familiar territory without getting bored. So yes, I did have fun, and I learned a few things, and I gave my brain a bit of a workout. Which is exactly what I like to see in a book about science."

This book especially incited fond memories from my college days when we were consuming chemistry and its historical progress. I still have my periodic table poster that hung next to my bed for a good part of last decade. It was fun to read anecdotes, vignettes and author's own dealings with elements. The writing is casual, occasionally whimsical, terribly nostalgic and overall interesting. Though Kean refrains from overt use of technical jargon, it just isn't possible to escape it completely. With a dose of nostalgia, I enjoyed reading this."

It's full of exactly the kind of stories I like: scientists and other clever people finding out about the universe. This one is all about the Periodic Table of Elements, and stories about every single element. Some get star treatment, but even ultra-rare Francium gets a shout out. The science is good and the writer doesn't dumb things down too much. He also makes excellent use of foot notes which provide great asides as well as jumping off points for further reading. "
356,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999881-geoff,3,This book is filled with stories about the discoveries of the elements of the periodic table - some I knew and many I had never heard before. 
357,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"This is a relatively slim book, but it’s packed with super interesting stories you never learned in chemistry, like:1) Scientists tracked the path of Lewis & Clark across America by looking for mercury deposits. The party took mercury tablets to “cure” ailments, and wherever they went #2, they left mercury in the soil2) 7 different elements were discovered in Ytterby, a tiny suburban town in Sweden3) the elements in the periodic table haven’t always been around: originally, there was just hydrogen. Through a variety of reactions, hydrogen (the simplest element) produced all other elements on the periodic table in our solar system. (This makes me wonder: what do other solar systems look like, elementally? Did they experience the same reactions yielding the same elements, or an entirely different set?)4) the creator of the death gas used in WW2 concentration camps, Zyklon B (well, the first version anyway, named Zyklon A—it got slightly tweaked) was Franz Haber, a Jewish man famous for killing many Allied soldiers in painful chemical ways during WWI. Zyklon B was later used to murder thousands of people, including Haber’s own relatives5) Two elements called niobium and tantalum (named after Niobe and Tantalus from Greek myth) are found in the the Congo, combined in a rock called coltan. Niobium and tantalum are metals used in cell phones. The huge demand for coltan in the late 1990s/early 2000s caused anarchy and devastation in the Congo6) A scientist named Seaborg who worked on the Manhattan Project discovered the elements americium (which powers smoke detectors, by the way) and curium in 1946. Rather than announcing it in a scientific journal, Seaborg announced it on a children’s show, Quiz Kids (a child asked Seaborg if he’d discovered any new elements lately, and he explained that he had; judging by the mail he received from schoolchildren, teachers across the globe refused to believe the children’s claims the next week in school)7) the first antibacterial drug wasn’t penicillin (the first antibiotic)—in 1932, a man named Domagk discovered that Prontosil, an industrial dye, could be injected into a sick person to cure them of a bacterial infection (Domagk initially made this discovery on mice; when his daughter Hildegarde tripped while holding a sewing needle and acquired a life-threatening infection, Domagk gave it a whirl in humans, and she got better)8) Tellurium smells strongly of garlic. Beryllium tastes like sugar (despite being a toxic metal). Potassium tastes like salt!9) the European Union, appropriately, uses europium in the ink on euros to show they’re not counterfeit10) In the African nation of Gabon, there exists the only natural nuclear fission reactor known to exist, called Oklo—fueled by uranium, blue-green algae (pond scum), and plain water (the only reason there’s not a gigantic hole burned into Gabon? When the uranium reaches critical mass, it boils off the water, and without the water, the reaction stops). My favourite chapter was chapter 9 (on poisonous elements) because poison is cool. I was especially interested in how a local doctor (Noboru Hagino) discovered that cadmium was poisoning the people of Kamioka, Japan: with the help of a public health professor, he plotted the homes of all the people who came down with the mysterious disease (known as itai-itai, or “ouch ouch” disease), and was able to discover that they all lived along the Jinzu River, which carried cadmium, a waste product from the local mine. This reminded me a lot of The Ghost Map, which, as in the case of Kamioka, tells the story of how a local doctor and a public health professional teamed up to trace the root of a deadly disease (cholera, in that case) using mapping. (Speaking of London—I was also interested to see Alexander Litvinenko, murdered by polonium-spiked tea in a London sushi restaurant, get a mention; I recently saw his grave in Highgate Cemetery). Definitely a fun read if you have a spare afternoon and wish you knew the more fun side of chemistry."
358,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4053034-laura,1,"I didn't finish this book. I couldn't finish this book because the parts of this book that are about science I know could most generously be described as ""missleading at best"". If that's the case about the stuff I know, how much is true in the stuff I don't know? I'm called upon to teach some chemistry despite the fact my real chemistry knowledge pretty much ends at physical chemistry and astrochemistry - so I really don't need to fill my head with stories and theories that are pale reflections of the current state of knowledge when I don't read enough of the literature to judge how correct they are.I'm not sure where the author looked up the theory of solar system formation he gives in Chapter 4, but it wasn't in anything written in the last 20 years. If he'd turned in what's written here on an astronomy exam when I was in a generous mood I might give him a point or two for having a couple of right ideas in there, but he'd still have an F.I started to get a clue there was a problem when the author called the collision of comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 (1993 F2) with Jupiter ""intergalactic"". Huh? How is the collision of two solar system objects intergalactic? There's no evidence that SL9 was an extra-solar comet, much less an extra-galactic comet, but ok, he's using an odd hyperbole to make it sound more exciting. Overall the book has a very bubbly, casual style to it so I'll let him use this oddly chosen word. Things get worse however, when he implies Jupiter is the reason C/Hale-Bopp (1995 O1) came into the inner solar system. At this point I'm still assuming he knows that is not true and he's wording things really poorly, but I'm beginning to doubt I know enough of the science in other parts of the book to be able to see through this sort of thing elsewhere. However, it's when he writes ""Because the stellar wind blew only the lightest, most common elements as far out as Jupiter, it should have the same basic elemental composition as real stars"", that I pause and make a WTF!?! note in the margin. It takes me half a lecture or more to explain our current understanding of solar system formation, so I won't go through it all in this review, but the above is pure nonsense. More pure nonsense occurs when he mentions that the cloud of gas and dust our solar system formed out of was flat. There's no evidence for that and it's extremely unlikely dynamically. Simple physics flattens any shape of cloud collapsing under gravity to a spinning disk.Coming back to the missleading at best parts, we are told there are apparently mini-nuclear booms in stars counterbalancing gravity rather than thermal pressure. Booms implies a series of nuclear bombs going off when it is actually the steady rate of fusion in the interior of the Sun that causes the thermal pressure that balances gravity. Finally, given that I'm a planetary scientist, I just can't let slide the description of the Moon forming due to an ""asteroid or comet impact"". Well ok. If you want to call a roughly Mars sized planetesimal an asteroid or comet. However, there aren't any Mars sized planetesimals left that we'd call an asteroid or comet today. Mars is really in no danger of being demoted from planet-hood.I haven't picked on every problem with the astrophysics presented in this chapter, but all this and more brings me to the end of Chapter 4 with no trust the author knows anything about what he's talking about. This is likely not true given all the glowing reviews, one even appearing in the well respected journal Nature (I'm guessing a review by a chemist that knew no astronomy?). But having lost my trust it can't be regained, and I won't be finishing this book."
359,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9255064-melissa,4,"Chemistry has never been my thing. I hated it in high school (except for the part where we melted mechanical pencils over the Bunsen burner). Recently watching the chemistry Crash Course episodes has reminded me that chemistry is not just the boring science class I struggled to stay awake through in high school. Chemistry is everything around us and understanding a bit about it will help me better understand the way the world works.So I picked up The Disappearing Spoon with that in mind and was richly rewarded. Kean’s writing style was fun and made the subject matter interesting. He talks not only about the science behind each element, but about the scientists who discovered them and the impact they had on the world. For example Mendeleev, who is credited with creating the Periodic Table, had a fascinating start. He was born in Siberia, the youngest of 11 children. His father died when he was only 13 and his mother worked incredibly hard to give him the chance to go to school. Imagine having to overcome all of those things just to be able to go to school! Another favorite of mine was Marie Curie. Her fascinating life, including a marriage that was far ahead of its time and the discovery of multiple elements was so interesting. She won a Nobel Prize in a time when women in America weren’t even allowed to vote. I would love to a biography that focused solely on her.The periodic table has changed the world in both positive and negative ways. Kean doesn’t shy away from the damage that’s been done because of the discovery of a new element. He talks about the effects of vaccinations and medicines and also at the way chemistry made things like the atom bomb possible. When cell phones became wildly popular in the 1990s the fight to find more of the metal used to create them caused the Congo to explode with fighting. People were in a frenzy to provide the metal that was in such high demand. “Overall more than 5 million people have died in Congo since the mid-1990s, making it the biggest waste of life since World War II. The fighting there is proof that in addition to all the uplifting moments the Periodic table has inspired it can also play on humankind's worst, most inhumane instincts.”This balanced look at the Table reminds us that with great knowledge (just like great power) comes great responsibility. Almost any scientific advance can be used for good or bad and there will always be a struggle to use it correctly. BOTTOM LINE: The most interesting book I’ve read ever read about chemistry and one that kept me intrigued the entire time. We live in a truly remarkable world and I’ll never regret reading a book that opens up a new corner of that world to me."
360,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/981514-minli,4,"Entertaining read--and a fascinating subject matter. I'm definitely the right audience for this book: someone who knows some chemistry but didn't get any higher degrees in it, and is more interested in the historical, cultural building of the periodic table than the hard science.Kean's wry prose never lets you forget that his point of view is subjective and conversational: he paints caricatures of famous scientists and makes ridiculous analogies. His audience is undoubtedly American. He does his best to explain concepts (some of which I still remembered!) in layman's terms, though I kind of dozed off at the discussion of alpha. He does a good job giving awesome lady scientists their due, like Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin, Maria Groppert-Mayer and Marie Curie. I learned a bunch of things, how thallium is the worst ever poison (the poisoner's poison) and that cobalt-60 is the dirtiest and worst ever a-bomb. The structuring of the elements grouped into chapters, chapters grouped into parts, gave the book a flow and rhythm. It might have benefited from a longer conclusion.This book has made me feel like the biggest dork ever, because when people mention some element now, I have to squash the impulse to say, ""Hey! Did you know that...""The Disappearing Spoon also showed to me what my chemistry, biology and physics teachers in high school and college never did: how magical, weird, wonderful, temperamental, dangerous and dramatic science can be, how they're heterogeneously mixed with Romance and politics. I wish I'd had this book in high school."
361,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19832185-thomas-frank,4,"As someone who never took chemistry, I found this book to provide just enough of the basics about the periodic table to enable me to sound at least a bit better than completely ignorant when talking about the subject. Beyond that, it's filled with interesting stories about the people who helped build the table and discover many of its elements, as well as other events that revolve around said elements. I particularly enjoyed the one about Germany's clandestine operations in the U.S. during WWI.One nitpick I had with this book: Every 2-3 pages, you'll find an asterisk that corresponds to a footnote in the back of the book. I'm the kind of person who simply cannot ignore these, and as a result, constantly going to the back of the book to read them made it a bit harder for me to immerse myself in the main text. Now, this is mainly the fault of my own brain, so I'm not subtracting anything from my score for it. Just be aware of this fact if you happen to be like me. Personally, I think the footnotes would have been less distracting if they were put on the actual page where they were referenced.Still, this book was really enjoyable. I look forward to digging into Kean's newer works when I've got some time."

Subtitle: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the ElementsWho could have imagined such a volume written about that chart that hangs in every high school chemistry classroom? I’m an admitted science geek. I loved the “Mr Wizard” TV show when I was a kid. (He encouraged us to perform all sorts of experiments using our mother’s kitchen utensils and supplies.) I never wanted a Barbie doll, I wanted a chemistry set and a microscope! So, I’ve had this book on my TBR list since it first came out. And I have to say that I’m a little disappointed.It’s not that Kean is a bad writer; he isn’t, and he’s quite thorough in exploring this topic. His enthusiasm and fascination for the periodic table comes through. But, it was just too much even for this science geek. Some parts were far more interesting to me than others. I loved the chapter on poisons, for example. I was less enthralled with the political infighting on what name to give to a newly discovered element. Also, I made the choice to listen to the audio format. Sean Runnette did a fine job of performing the audio. However, the sometimes dry subject matter made for a more difficult listening experience. I might have enjoyed this more in text."
363,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3349963-craig-cottingham,4,"I was a chemical engineering major in college, so some of the background information (like the basics of the periodic table) was familiar to me and therefore a little tedious to read. Outside of that, however, this was a fascinating book that I think would be accessible to non-beakerheads.Each chapter is devoted to a group of elements that are related. Instead of going for the obvious groupings (the inert gasses, the halogens, etc.) he comes at them from a refreshingly sideways direction. There's a chapter on poisons (from the obvious like arsenic, to thallium, which was responsible for thousands of deaths from contaminated groundwater in Japan) and another on measurements (from the international standard kilogram, which is an ingot of iridium, to the cesium-powered atomic clocks which define the international standard second). Each one reads a little like an episode of James Burke's TV series Connections, the way the discussion of one element blends into another. Sometimes the connections and the groupings are a little contrived, but not jarringly so, and I'm sure it was necessary to avoid a ""here are all the elements that didn't fit in anywhere else"" chapter.Highly recommended."
364,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"There’s a lot packed into this book. I enjoyed the look of the history of the periodic table; how it got started, the changes made over time, the discoveries of elements. Intermingled are the stories of the people; the scientists who figured things out and made things happen. Intertwined yet again are the stories of the theory and workings of atoms; what makes them tick, what makes them unique, what makes them react. Then there’s all those scientists; some humorous, some deceitful or crazy for fame. I really enjoyed the bit about the periodic table in the future and how the table if ever-changing and expanding. This is a wonderful book for those who enjoy chemistry, physics and anything “earthy”. "
365,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Fun romp through the periodic table - lots of chemistry and physics, but even more stories about science and the people who do it. Sam Kean has fun with history. The book is not very technical, but approachable and occasionally humorous. The stories are diverse - there are many elements on the table, so we jump around quite a bit. I enjoyed this on audio, found it both educational and entertaining, but I probably won’t remember much as there is no common storyline other than the stories being about elements."
366,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,2,"Uneven and only fitfully engaging, The Disappearing Spoon is less a history of the periodic table and how scientists have come to understand elemental matter than it is a collection of facts about those elements and anecdotes about the various researchers who've discovered them. Sam Kean doesn't really have the knack for explaining (or re-explaining) scientific concepts to people who haven't studied chemistry or physics since secondary school, and relies too much on clunky metaphors and irritating anthropomorphisms. (For example, Kean writes that stars are ""[d]esperate to maintain high temperatures."" Stars are not sentient. They do not have feelings. Even more jaw-droppingly asinine, though, are sentences like ""In addition to Haber's being a Jew, Germany excommunicated him because he had become passé."" Do I need to break down why this is, at an absolute minimum, a tacky way of putting things?) He never actually fully explains how the periodic table works.More damningly to me, as a historian, is that Kean tries to write from a perspective which is determinedly presentist. His interest in the past seems to primarily stem from wanting to know the backstory of the discovery and refinement of certain scientific concepts, rather than any desire to engage with the history of science as an evolving conceptual system which is inevitably shaped by those who practice it. For a man who seems fascinated by the universe on scales both macro and micro, Kean seems profoundly uninterested in the human."

There were a few times when the author simplified technical explanations, which I think made it more confusing. For that reason, I almost gave this book a 4. However there were enough moments where my mind was completely blown that I decided it had to be a 5. The first chapter is boring, but it is well worth pushing through. (What is it with science and very boring first chapters. Always. Start with something that draws me in for cryin' out loud!) There is a fascinating chapter on elements in times of war (Gold? Who needs gold? Give me molybdenum and tungsten.) and of course causing wars. A chapter that delves into lasers and masers (Holy shit, this was awesome! Seriously? How did I not know how lasers work? How did I learn all of the basic principles in physics, but I never learned how they come together in the most fantastic, brilliant way? I am happy to have rectified this situation.) and also the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a newish state of matter where a few thousand atoms becomes ""one giant marshmallow"" of an atom-a singularity and on a macro scale. This chapter ends with:""As technology keeps improving, scientists have gotten better and better at inducing matter to form the BEC. It's not like anyone's taking orders yet, but scientists might soon be able to build 'matter lasers' that shoot out ultra-focused beams of atoms thousands of times more powerful that light lasers, or construct 'supersolid' ice cubes that CAN FLOW THROUGH EACH OTHER WITHOUT LOSING THEIR SOLIDITY [emphasis mine]."" If I were a science teacher, the very next thing I would do after teaching this is have my students write a sci-fi story touching on where this technology is going next. What's it like to live in a world where solids can flow through each other? I know it's impossibly silly, but I immediately imagined humans that can walk through walls and stuff like that. Of course, this only happens at way below zero temperatures and on a very small scale. But you know, a girl can dream. There's also a chapter called ""Poisoner's Corridor: 'Ouch-Ouch'."" No need to elaborate. There's a chapter on elements as currency and of course fraud. There's even a section on how elements deceive our sense of taste-fascinating! (An example- chewing potassium gymnemate will make raw sugar heaped on your tongue taste like sand)Some other awesome tidbits:The person who discovered x-rays thought he went mad when he first saw the bones of his hands and a key hidden in a book. ""The primary component of taste, smell, is the only sense that bypasses our logical neural processing and connects directly to the brain's emotional centers.""""And whereas electrons absorb and emit light of the same color (yellow in, yellow out), fluorescent molecules absorb high-energy light (ultraviolet light) but emit that energy as lower-energy, visible light."" That's why we can see scorpions glow in the dark under black lights! This is what makes UV visible to us! The most powerful lasers today can produce beams that for a fraction of a second produce more power than the whole United States.Seriously, this book goes all over the place, but still manages to be organized. Loved it! "
368,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie,3,"""The Disappearing Spoon"" teaches the chemistry and physics of atoms and the periodic table. It's taught primarily in the context of short biographies about the Noble prize winning scientists (plus some others) who discovered the various elements or who discovered important things about how the elements or atoms are put together.Based on the book description I was given, I was expecting more trivia about the elements and how they are and have been used rather than a book teaching science with a main focus on scientists. However, the author's casual, lively, and sometimes crude tone made the stories entertaining--probably even more so to young males than to me. I did get a little tired of the author's judgmental attitude, though. It seemed like every human action had to be either brilliant or insanely stupid.The author's explanations of how things worked (atoms, periodic table, etc.) were easy for me to follow, but that might partly be because I took a lot of science courses in college. The initial science lessons were high school level, but the ending lessons were more college level (though high schoolers can probably follow them).The book primarily focused on science and scientists, but there were a few stories of invention, greed, destruction or just plain weirdness based around non-scientists. Though I didn't actually check to make sure, it seemed like every element on the periodic table was covered at least briefly. Some of the areas in which he discussed the use of the elements were warfare (chemical warfare, nuclear bombs, dirty bombs), medicine, politics, art, biology (especially DNA), as poison, as money (counterfeiting, a strange gold rush), and under super-cool conditions. He also covered a Big Bang model of how the elements were formed (with a ""see, no god needed!"" emphasis), how radiometric dating methods were thought up and used to generate dates for the age of the Earth that were old enough to give biological evolution a chance of occurring (since previous dating methods gave too ""young"" of an age to allow for it), and how biases can prevent critical viewing of scientific data (though he didn't seem to notice his own bias).He worked a lot of ""there is no God, humans & Earth aren't special, and evolution is true"" apologetics into this book. I wouldn't mind so much if, in the appendix, he hadn't presented what ""young-earth creationists believe"" by mixing true statements with misrepresented and apparently ridiculous ones as well as completely inaccurate ones. So now, if these readers come across the true argument, they'll dismiss it without really considering it--they'll think they know all about it when they don't.There were a few black and white photographs of scientists and a few charts. Overall, the book was entertaining and interesting, though not so much so that I'd want to read it again. The people who'd be most interested by it are probably teen or college age males who idolize science as pure and untarnished but who also like somewhat scandalous tales about scientists, their competitions to make Noble-winning discoveries, and their fights over who made a discovery first.I received this Advanced Reader Copy for review purposes from the publisher. "
369,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author relates many anecdotes of the discovery and uses of several elements with (as he says about those who know the periodic table) ""dweeby nonchalance.” It is meant to be a readable, interesting book of popular science for the lay reader, and indeed it is full of fascinating anecdotes about all things elemental. (The titular spoon is made of gallium, metal that melts in low temperatures and therefore a spoon made of it dissolves in tea. Ha ha, periodic table practical jokes!) Based on the title alone, I expected a lot of anecdotes such as the battle over the molybdenum mine in Colorado during WWII to help the Nazi war effort, or endless spats over naming rights of elements, but this book contains so much more. The madman Fritz Haber and his chlorine gas experiments; how the niobium in your cell phone helped finance the brutal Congo wars; an overview of the Bose-Einstein Condensate, the fifth state of matter; Henry Moseley’s electron beam; the alpha constant; why silicon-based life forms are extremely unlikely; Cobalt 60 dirty bombs; Monte Carlo science, itai-itai disease caused by Cadmium poisoning from mining companies on Japan; the role of gadolinium in MRI machines and cancer fighting; the left or right ""handedness"" of proteins; sulfur bacteria and how it relates to the sense of taste; the longest ""word"" ever, a technical term that is too long to be written; why we can unknowingly breathe in nitrogen without gasping for air until we suddenly collapse and die; why idolaters of Gandhi dislike iodine; how a lack of salt in a person suggests the nonexistence of the soul; how brass might be the nugget of truth behind the King Midas myth; how the science of bubbles led to the discovery of radon; and more. As you can see, the scope of this work is vast, possibly too much so. While it is written in a personable, conversational style, I felt that Kean doesn't manage to convey to the meanest scientific intelligence (namely me) a full understanding of the science he uses in the book, such as the aforementioned alpha constant, or how exactly electrons move from their ""shells."" Such information isn't necessary to appreciate the scientific history here, so for me it would have been better off cut entirely if impossible to simplify. I don't need the technical details to approve of a book that tells us that Lewis and Clark's route can be traced by the trace mercury in their feces, or refers to a Mark Twain story in which Satan is depicted as being made of radium, or that Paul McCartney was awarded a rhodium record (rather than gold or platinum) for his unsurpassed sales. That's the stuff that keeps the lay reader in their seats."

He writes as if he was chatting with the reader in a coffee shop or a tavern, regaling his friends with one anecdote after another. He's imparting his knowledge of science by the use of quirky, fun facts and interesting stories about the scientists involved.This is not set up like a typical chemistry textbook. The chapters are divided into areas of interest such as astronomy, poisons, money, war, medicine, and periods of history. The author is a physicist so the book had a lot of information about elements made in the lab, radioactive elements, nuclear chemistry, and the atomic bomb. For me, that was the most challenging part of the book.He writes about Linus Pauling's theory of a triple helix being trumped by James Watson and Francis Crick's double helix model of DNA. The attractive Marie Curie was a source of gossip when she took men into dark closets to show them radioactive specimens. Ghandhi told the people of India to dry their own salt instead of paying a British salt tax, only to have many people develop goiter due to lack of iodine. The trail taken by Lewis and Clark is known because anthropologists found (poisonous) mercury capsules that the explorers were using as laxatives. These types of stories make science seem more approachable.The title of the book comes from a practical joke. Gallium, which resembles aluminum, is a solid below 84 degrees F, and can be molded into a spoon. When it is dipped into hot tea, the surprised guest finds the spoon disappearing as it melts away. (Youtube has some ""disappearing spoon"" videos.)This is a book that can be enjoyed by the lay person as well as a scientist. Some chapters will be much easier to understand if a reader has had an introduction to the Periodic Table, such as in a high school Chemistry course. I would have preferred having the footnotes on the bottom of the pages rather than in the back of the book. Overall, the author should be commended for making science fun."
371,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3096541-amy,4,"I have to confess I didn't pay much attention to chemistry. Once the instructor talked about electrons, protons, atoms and the nucleus I usually turned on my Walkman (the cassette kind, now antique!). It never seemed interesting because it wasn't something that related at all to real life. If I had a teacher like Sam Kean, however, that could have been different.Fast forward too many years, and now I'm engrossed in this nonfiction 'memoir' of the Periodic Table of Elements. Like any good biography, this has scandal, lies, fraud, madness, explosions (!!!) and lots of name-dropping. Kean explains just what the periodic table is, but in a format that reads more like a novel, with anecdotal details to liven it up. Mercury pills were used by Lewis and Clark for their health? Yep, and you can trace their path (um, at least their bathroom trips on their journey) by where scientists have found unusually high amounts of mercury in the soil. The poet Robert Lowell? Did lithium ruin his work by making him sane? Who knew the lies and fraud and mind games played by scientists intent on getting a Nobel Prize! There's no getting around it, this is a book that makes you think. It's not simple and it assumes you have a basic knowledge of science. Some areas were over my head, but not for long. Kean is a wonderful teacher with a sassy wise guy voice that livens up any of the deeper areas."
372,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47354-dave,4,"For me this book was a pleasure to listen to. I plan to read a paper or e-book edition shortly. A delightful, an engaging blend of lyrical prose, historic anecdotes and fascinating information. Reminiscent, to me, of some of the writing of Lewis Thomas, Oliver Sacks, Barry Lopez, Edward Abbey and John McPhee.Brain/mind candy or chicken soup for the nerd's soul. Does that make me a dualist?The chapter essays are wide ranging anecdotal expositions of elements and families of elements. Not only stories about the scientists who prospected for and predicted the existence of certain elements, and created schemata for organizing them but about the influence of various elements on cultures, politics, economics and even philosophy. The stories added greatly to my appreciation for and understanding of the lives and work of some well known and some no longer famous scientists. The meditations on peculiar properties of some groups of atoms and alternative arrangements for the Periodic Table bumped my rating of the book from between 4 and 5 stars to clearly 5 stars. Others not so smitten on the history of science and mathematics may find it only mildly interesting or even boring. A must read for nerds, history buffs and fans of creative non-fiction. "
373,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2968341-linda-isakson,5,"I don't normally review non-fiction reads, but this one is just too superb to pass up! A wonderful and engaging read from cover-to-cover. Sam Kean takes the periodic table of the elements, a chart that makes most people cringe at thoughts of high school (or college) chemistry, and turns it into a riveting drama about the table's origins and the hunt to find new elements. Science geeks will love the scientific jargon but you don't need a degree in chemistry to understand the fascinating stories behind the revolutionaries responsible for our modern day technologies. This is definitely a book you can read over and over and still find little morsels you might have previously missed. Kean is amusing, insightful and presents complex information in a very understable package. A must read for fans of scientific history."

I so wish we’d had this as a set text when I took chemistry in high school. Not only might I have understood the rubbish our teacher was spouting, I might’ve liked it and even passed the bloody thing! Nobody ever even bothered to explain the Periodic Table to us and why it looks the way it does. And it's true: watching a gallium spoon dissolve in a glass of water is pretty cool.I had no idea the world of chemistry and physics was such a hotbed of rivalry, gossip and scandal. Delicious stuff."
375,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80835-celeste-ng,0,"Fascinating to me as the daughter of a chemist--I grew up with periodic tables all around, quite literally (I had a periodic table placemat!). Some of these stories were familiar to me, but most were new. Highly recommended for those who want to why the periodic table matters, and to know more about how the elements have changed human lives, sometimes drastically."

In his attempt to introduce us to different chemicals and explain their lives, the author personifies them as characters in a smutty romance. So I quit what was up till then, an interesting book. "
377,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,5,"I’ve been reading a lot of non-fiction lately, and for me, that’s really...well, unusual. If you had asked me a couple of years ago how I felt about non-fiction, I would have described it as eye-glazingly dull, a dry recitation of facts. But now I eagerly scour the non-fiction shelves at the library. I know -- it’s crazy!The only explanation is that non-fiction has gotten better. (It can’t be me that’s changed.) The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean is a fine example of this better, more interesting non-fiction. Kean doesn’t skimp on the facts. He’s packed his book with oodles of information about the elements. What saves his book from being merely a mind-numbing collection of elemental characteristics may be gleaned from the book’s full title: The Disappearing Spoon and Other Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of Elements.Yes, it’s the madness and weirdness that brings the elements to life, and Kean seems to have dug up a fascinating story for virtually every element on the periodic table. For example, the title’s disappearing spoon refers to a (nerdy) practical joke in which unsuspecting victims are given a gallium spoon to stir their tea. I was particularly interested in the stories surrounding the radioactive elements, which ranged from an ex-KGB spy that was murdered with polonium-laced sushi in 2006 to a boy scout that tried to build his own nuclear reactor.Reading non-fiction like this is not only painless, but fun, and I’m convinced that I’m retaining all of those pesky little facts better that I normally would because I’ve so enjoyed learning them. Just wait until we meet at the next dinner party and I regale you with tales of elemental hijinks. If you’ve long despaired of enjoying non-fiction, perhaps now is the time to give it another try. "
378,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,4,"I pretty much knew I was going to like this book as soon as I heard about it. I mean, come on, it's about science! Some of the factoids I learned in this book will stick with me for a long time, like the naturally occurring nuclear reactor in Africa, or the reason why the Washington monument is capped with aluminum. At first I was disappointed that the book had end notes instead of footnotes. I do like footnotes. However, many of them were so long that I understood the reason for it. I ended up just having two bookmarks, one for where I was in the book, and one for where I was in the end notes.On one hand, there were sections that I feel I would have liked better if it hadn't been so long since my last chemistry class. On the other hand, if I were more well-versed in chemistry, some of the stories wouldn't have been so new and interesting to me.There were one or two slow sections in this book, but the interesting sections more than balanced it out. More to the point, this was a book that made me feel smarter for having read it--that goes a long way.One minor quibble that bothered me is that while there were two blank periodic tables which I found quickly, the actual periodic table in the book comes so close to the end that I wasn't able to find it, and I was looking for one. I would have liked to have one to reference. By the time I found it, I was almost done with the book and didn't need it as much. If the periodic table had been printed as an end paper, or in the beginning, or even at the start of the end notes where I could have found it, that would have made it easier to understand some of what the author talked about. After all, it's been a while since high school chemistry, and I only look at that chart periodically. (ha ha)"
379,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1951489-amanda,4,"Think back to your high school chemistry class. Chances are, the artwork adorning the classroom probably contained a poster with the periodic table of the elements. For some reason, all through 7 chemistry classes, my favorite was tungsten.Pop quiz - what is the chemical symbol for tungsten? Why, ""W"" of course! Why not T or Tu or Tg?? The ""W""is for wolfram, the German name for tungsten. Without it, those handy incandescent lightbulbs would not operate if it weren't for those tungsten filaments.I've always had a soft spot for science trivia, and the periodic table of the elements is full of interesting stories. If you have the same soft spot, I'd recommend ""The Disappearing Spoon"" by Sam Keane. The title references a property of the element gallium. Gallium turns from a solid to a liquid at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the author, a favorite prank of grad students is to fashion spoons made of gallium and to hand them out with tea or coffee. The spoon looks like the metal of other silverware, but when used in tea or coffee, melts away - a disappearing spoon!Another reason this is a great book is that it humanizes many of the famous scientists. In reading through textbooks, you never see into the personal lives or professional struggles of the discoveries and constants described in the text. Yet in The Disappearing Spoon, you see the races to get published (discovering and naming rights to elements), the discouragement at being passed up for a Nobel Prize yet again, and how wars and politics shape the or stunt technology."
380,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933518-jason,5,"Sometimes books just fall in my lap....Although I do pretty much put myself in a position where they seem to fall from the sky at a brisk rate. I went to Barnes & Noble the other day with the wife, ostensibly to get a cup of coffee, and picked up this book and Jose Saramago's 'The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'. I couldn't tell you what it was about it that caught my attention. I'm doing that thing again where I read too many books at once, but despite my inward pleas to the contrary, I couldn't resist picking it up and starting to read. What a great book. Refreshing, endlessly intriguing. Every page was a pleasure. Basically a book like this tells me two things: what a whiny spoiled brat I am, and what a complete dimwitted ape I am. In these pages I read about a woman who rode horseback for 1200 miles through a Russian winter to get her kid to a college only to see him rejected, and she then rode 400 more miles to get him to yet another school after which she promptly, and understandably, died. That's just so Russian. Then I read about a man who not only invented the Bunsen burner, he also invented the Spectrometer, and subsequently discovered several new elements, all in the 1850s. I look at myself and realize I'm liable to get suicidal if we run out of half and half, and my greatest achievement in life has been to arrange The Police's 'Roxanne' for the ukulele. Sometimes a good dose of perspective is extremely illuminating. "

Then The Disappearing Spoon might be the book for you.This book is exactly what it is made out to be. With a full title of The Disappearing Spoon And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, it tells you everything you should know. Kean starts with the periodic table, talks about how it was created, and from there, tells of fun, tragic, or interesting stories about all of the elements.Most of the science in The Disappearing Spoon is understandable with a high-school knowledge of chemistry. But even if you don't know enough chemistry, those parts can easily be skipped. Most of the book is heavily inspired by scientific history, rather than science itself. If you want to know more about the bickering and rivalries between chemists, this book is perfect. The Disappearing Spoon is highly entertaining, and it's clear the author has done extensive research into the lives of the scientists he talks about. My only gripe is that he has the tendency to lose direction sometimes, and flounders between all of the threads of stories he started, no longer clear on exactly what point he wanted to make. "

This is at times a ""cute book"" but in spite of it's promise it will help you if you have a deep abiding love of chemistry before you crack it open.It doesn't really appear to be organized all that well and isn't truly geared to the average reader. He opens up with his early fascination with mercury (the element, not the planet or the mythological deity) and how it led him into literature etc. Then he sets out to induce us all into the wonder/wonders that is/are the periodic table. I wasn't drawn into chemistry beyond what's required in high school, neither was I here. It didn't work, I lost interest quickly and wasn't interested in going on with the class.Enjoy if it's cup of tea...not mine. Maybe you'll like it, but I can't recommend it."
383,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"A fun read, for a certain value of fun. This is a book for science geeks, or those curious about science. If you're a full-fledged science geek, this could be a relatively light side read. If you're more of a layman, it's an opportunity to read some science that shouldn't be too far over your head, most of the time. I fall in the latter category. I wouldn't exactly call this a light read (though it's certainly easier going than some books that I've attempted) but the personable tone and fascinating stories kept me interested even when the going got a little tough. For a more science literate reader, those same stories would probably make it easier to get through the more familiar territory without getting bored. So yes, I did have fun, and I learned a few things, and I gave my brain a bit of a workout. Which is exactly what I like to see in a book about science."
384,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,3,"Since I have ditched my chemical engineering degree for a (once shiny) computer science one, whenever I see books like these I tend to gravitate towards them in pure nostalgia and consume them with a single minded passion. This book especially incited fond memories from my college days when we were consuming chemistry and its historical progress. I still have my periodic table poster that hung next to my bed for a good part of last decade. It was fun to read anecdotes, vignettes and author's own dealings with elements. The writing is casual, occasionally whimsical, terribly nostalgic and overall interesting. Though Kean refrains from overt use of technical jargon, it just isn't possible to escape it completely. With a dose of nostalgia, I enjoyed reading this."
385,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5984690-sean-o,5,"One of the top non-fiction books I've read this year. It's full of exactly the kind of stories I like: scientists and other clever people finding out about the universe. This one is all about the Periodic Table of Elements, and stories about every single element. Some get star treatment, but even ultra-rare Francium gets a shout out. The science is good and the writer doesn't dumb things down too much. He also makes excellent use of foot notes which provide great asides as well as jumping off points for further reading. "
386,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999881-geoff,3,This book is filled with stories about the discoveries of the elements of the periodic table - some I knew and many I had never heard before. 
387,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"This is a relatively slim book, but it’s packed with super interesting stories you never learned in chemistry, like:1) Scientists tracked the path of Lewis & Clark across America by looking for mercury deposits. The party took mercury tablets to “cure” ailments, and wherever they went #2, they left mercury in the soil2) 7 different elements were discovered in Ytterby, a tiny suburban town in Sweden3) the elements in the periodic table haven’t always been around: originally, there was just hydrogen. Through a variety of reactions, hydrogen (the simplest element) produced all other elements on the periodic table in our solar system. (This makes me wonder: what do other solar systems look like, elementally? Did they experience the same reactions yielding the same elements, or an entirely different set?)4) the creator of the death gas used in WW2 concentration camps, Zyklon B (well, the first version anyway, named Zyklon A—it got slightly tweaked) was Franz Haber, a Jewish man famous for killing many Allied soldiers in painful chemical ways during WWI. Zyklon B was later used to murder thousands of people, including Haber’s own relatives5) Two elements called niobium and tantalum (named after Niobe and Tantalus from Greek myth) are found in the the Congo, combined in a rock called coltan. Niobium and tantalum are metals used in cell phones. The huge demand for coltan in the late 1990s/early 2000s caused anarchy and devastation in the Congo6) A scientist named Seaborg who worked on the Manhattan Project discovered the elements americium (which powers smoke detectors, by the way) and curium in 1946. Rather than announcing it in a scientific journal, Seaborg announced it on a children’s show, Quiz Kids (a child asked Seaborg if he’d discovered any new elements lately, and he explained that he had; judging by the mail he received from schoolchildren, teachers across the globe refused to believe the children’s claims the next week in school)7) the first antibacterial drug wasn’t penicillin (the first antibiotic)—in 1932, a man named Domagk discovered that Prontosil, an industrial dye, could be injected into a sick person to cure them of a bacterial infection (Domagk initially made this discovery on mice; when his daughter Hildegarde tripped while holding a sewing needle and acquired a life-threatening infection, Domagk gave it a whirl in humans, and she got better)8) Tellurium smells strongly of garlic. Beryllium tastes like sugar (despite being a toxic metal). Potassium tastes like salt!9) the European Union, appropriately, uses europium in the ink on euros to show they’re not counterfeit10) In the African nation of Gabon, there exists the only natural nuclear fission reactor known to exist, called Oklo—fueled by uranium, blue-green algae (pond scum), and plain water (the only reason there’s not a gigantic hole burned into Gabon? When the uranium reaches critical mass, it boils off the water, and without the water, the reaction stops). My favourite chapter was chapter 9 (on poisonous elements) because poison is cool. I was especially interested in how a local doctor (Noboru Hagino) discovered that cadmium was poisoning the people of Kamioka, Japan: with the help of a public health professor, he plotted the homes of all the people who came down with the mysterious disease (known as itai-itai, or “ouch ouch” disease), and was able to discover that they all lived along the Jinzu River, which carried cadmium, a waste product from the local mine. This reminded me a lot of The Ghost Map, which, as in the case of Kamioka, tells the story of how a local doctor and a public health professional teamed up to trace the root of a deadly disease (cholera, in that case) using mapping. (Speaking of London—I was also interested to see Alexander Litvinenko, murdered by polonium-spiked tea in a London sushi restaurant, get a mention; I recently saw his grave in Highgate Cemetery). Definitely a fun read if you have a spare afternoon and wish you knew the more fun side of chemistry."
388,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4053034-laura,1,"I didn't finish this book. I couldn't finish this book because the parts of this book that are about science I know could most generously be described as ""missleading at best"". If that's the case about the stuff I know, how much is true in the stuff I don't know? I'm called upon to teach some chemistry despite the fact my real chemistry knowledge pretty much ends at physical chemistry and astrochemistry - so I really don't need to fill my head with stories and theories that are pale reflections of the current state of knowledge when I don't read enough of the literature to judge how correct they are.I'm not sure where the author looked up the theory of solar system formation he gives in Chapter 4, but it wasn't in anything written in the last 20 years. If he'd turned in what's written here on an astronomy exam when I was in a generous mood I might give him a point or two for having a couple of right ideas in there, but he'd still have an F.I started to get a clue there was a problem when the author called the collision of comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 (1993 F2) with Jupiter ""intergalactic"". Huh? How is the collision of two solar system objects intergalactic? There's no evidence that SL9 was an extra-solar comet, much less an extra-galactic comet, but ok, he's using an odd hyperbole to make it sound more exciting. Overall the book has a very bubbly, casual style to it so I'll let him use this oddly chosen word. Things get worse however, when he implies Jupiter is the reason C/Hale-Bopp (1995 O1) came into the inner solar system. At this point I'm still assuming he knows that is not true and he's wording things really poorly, but I'm beginning to doubt I know enough of the science in other parts of the book to be able to see through this sort of thing elsewhere. However, it's when he writes ""Because the stellar wind blew only the lightest, most common elements as far out as Jupiter, it should have the same basic elemental composition as real stars"", that I pause and make a WTF!?! note in the margin. It takes me half a lecture or more to explain our current understanding of solar system formation, so I won't go through it all in this review, but the above is pure nonsense. More pure nonsense occurs when he mentions that the cloud of gas and dust our solar system formed out of was flat. There's no evidence for that and it's extremely unlikely dynamically. Simple physics flattens any shape of cloud collapsing under gravity to a spinning disk.Coming back to the missleading at best parts, we are told there are apparently mini-nuclear booms in stars counterbalancing gravity rather than thermal pressure. Booms implies a series of nuclear bombs going off when it is actually the steady rate of fusion in the interior of the Sun that causes the thermal pressure that balances gravity. Finally, given that I'm a planetary scientist, I just can't let slide the description of the Moon forming due to an ""asteroid or comet impact"". Well ok. If you want to call a roughly Mars sized planetesimal an asteroid or comet. However, there aren't any Mars sized planetesimals left that we'd call an asteroid or comet today. Mars is really in no danger of being demoted from planet-hood.I haven't picked on every problem with the astrophysics presented in this chapter, but all this and more brings me to the end of Chapter 4 with no trust the author knows anything about what he's talking about. This is likely not true given all the glowing reviews, one even appearing in the well respected journal Nature (I'm guessing a review by a chemist that knew no astronomy?). But having lost my trust it can't be regained, and I won't be finishing this book."
389,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9255064-melissa,4,"Chemistry has never been my thing. I hated it in high school (except for the part where we melted mechanical pencils over the Bunsen burner). Recently watching the chemistry Crash Course episodes has reminded me that chemistry is not just the boring science class I struggled to stay awake through in high school. Chemistry is everything around us and understanding a bit about it will help me better understand the way the world works.So I picked up The Disappearing Spoon with that in mind and was richly rewarded. Kean’s writing style was fun and made the subject matter interesting. He talks not only about the science behind each element, but about the scientists who discovered them and the impact they had on the world. For example Mendeleev, who is credited with creating the Periodic Table, had a fascinating start. He was born in Siberia, the youngest of 11 children. His father died when he was only 13 and his mother worked incredibly hard to give him the chance to go to school. Imagine having to overcome all of those things just to be able to go to school! Another favorite of mine was Marie Curie. Her fascinating life, including a marriage that was far ahead of its time and the discovery of multiple elements was so interesting. She won a Nobel Prize in a time when women in America weren’t even allowed to vote. I would love to a biography that focused solely on her.The periodic table has changed the world in both positive and negative ways. Kean doesn’t shy away from the damage that’s been done because of the discovery of a new element. He talks about the effects of vaccinations and medicines and also at the way chemistry made things like the atom bomb possible. When cell phones became wildly popular in the 1990s the fight to find more of the metal used to create them caused the Congo to explode with fighting. People were in a frenzy to provide the metal that was in such high demand. “Overall more than 5 million people have died in Congo since the mid-1990s, making it the biggest waste of life since World War II. The fighting there is proof that in addition to all the uplifting moments the Periodic table has inspired it can also play on humankind's worst, most inhumane instincts.”This balanced look at the Table reminds us that with great knowledge (just like great power) comes great responsibility. Almost any scientific advance can be used for good or bad and there will always be a struggle to use it correctly. BOTTOM LINE: The most interesting book I’ve read ever read about chemistry and one that kept me intrigued the entire time. We live in a truly remarkable world and I’ll never regret reading a book that opens up a new corner of that world to me."
390,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/981514-minli,4,"Entertaining read--and a fascinating subject matter. I'm definitely the right audience for this book: someone who knows some chemistry but didn't get any higher degrees in it, and is more interested in the historical, cultural building of the periodic table than the hard science.Kean's wry prose never lets you forget that his point of view is subjective and conversational: he paints caricatures of famous scientists and makes ridiculous analogies. His audience is undoubtedly American. He does his best to explain concepts (some of which I still remembered!) in layman's terms, though I kind of dozed off at the discussion of alpha. He does a good job giving awesome lady scientists their due, like Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin, Maria Groppert-Mayer and Marie Curie. I learned a bunch of things, how thallium is the worst ever poison (the poisoner's poison) and that cobalt-60 is the dirtiest and worst ever a-bomb. The structuring of the elements grouped into chapters, chapters grouped into parts, gave the book a flow and rhythm. It might have benefited from a longer conclusion.This book has made me feel like the biggest dork ever, because when people mention some element now, I have to squash the impulse to say, ""Hey! Did you know that...""The Disappearing Spoon also showed to me what my chemistry, biology and physics teachers in high school and college never did: how magical, weird, wonderful, temperamental, dangerous and dramatic science can be, how they're heterogeneously mixed with Romance and politics. I wish I'd had this book in high school."
391,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19832185-thomas-frank,4,"As someone who never took chemistry, I found this book to provide just enough of the basics about the periodic table to enable me to sound at least a bit better than completely ignorant when talking about the subject. Beyond that, it's filled with interesting stories about the people who helped build the table and discover many of its elements, as well as other events that revolve around said elements. I particularly enjoyed the one about Germany's clandestine operations in the U.S. during WWI.One nitpick I had with this book: Every 2-3 pages, you'll find an asterisk that corresponds to a footnote in the back of the book. I'm the kind of person who simply cannot ignore these, and as a result, constantly going to the back of the book to read them made it a bit harder for me to immerse myself in the main text. Now, this is mainly the fault of my own brain, so I'm not subtracting anything from my score for it. Just be aware of this fact if you happen to be like me. Personally, I think the footnotes would have been less distracting if they were put on the actual page where they were referenced.Still, this book was really enjoyable. I look forward to digging into Kean's newer works when I've got some time."

And I have to say that I’m a little disappointed.It’s not that Kean is a bad writer; he isn’t, and he’s quite thorough in exploring this topic. His enthusiasm and fascination for the periodic table comes through. But, it was just too much even for this science geek. Some parts were far more interesting to me than others. I loved the chapter on poisons, for example. I was less enthralled with the political infighting on what name to give to a newly discovered element. Also, I made the choice to listen to the audio format. Sean Runnette did a fine job of performing the audio. However, the sometimes dry subject matter made for a more difficult listening experience. I might have enjoyed this more in text."
393,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3349963-craig-cottingham,4,"I was a chemical engineering major in college, so some of the background information (like the basics of the periodic table) was familiar to me and therefore a little tedious to read. Outside of that, however, this was a fascinating book that I think would be accessible to non-beakerheads.Each chapter is devoted to a group of elements that are related. Instead of going for the obvious groupings (the inert gasses, the halogens, etc.) he comes at them from a refreshingly sideways direction. There's a chapter on poisons (from the obvious like arsenic, to thallium, which was responsible for thousands of deaths from contaminated groundwater in Japan) and another on measurements (from the international standard kilogram, which is an ingot of iridium, to the cesium-powered atomic clocks which define the international standard second). Each one reads a little like an episode of James Burke's TV series Connections, the way the discussion of one element blends into another. Sometimes the connections and the groupings are a little contrived, but not jarringly so, and I'm sure it was necessary to avoid a ""here are all the elements that didn't fit in anywhere else"" chapter.Highly recommended."
394,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"There’s a lot packed into this book. I enjoyed the look of the history of the periodic table; how it got started, the changes made over time, the discoveries of elements. Intermingled are the stories of the people; the scientists who figured things out and made things happen. Intertwined yet again are the stories of the theory and workings of atoms; what makes them tick, what makes them unique, what makes them react. Then there’s all those scientists; some humorous, some deceitful or crazy for fame. I really enjoyed the bit about the periodic table in the future and how the table if ever-changing and expanding. This is a wonderful book for those who enjoy chemistry, physics and anything “earthy”. "
395,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Fun romp through the periodic table - lots of chemistry and physics, but even more stories about science and the people who do it. Sam Kean has fun with history. The book is not very technical, but approachable and occasionally humorous. The stories are diverse - there are many elements on the table, so we jump around quite a bit. I enjoyed this on audio, found it both educational and entertaining, but I probably won’t remember much as there is no common storyline other than the stories being about elements."
396,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,2,"Uneven and only fitfully engaging, The Disappearing Spoon is less a history of the periodic table and how scientists have come to understand elemental matter than it is a collection of facts about those elements and anecdotes about the various researchers who've discovered them. Sam Kean doesn't really have the knack for explaining (or re-explaining) scientific concepts to people who haven't studied chemistry or physics since secondary school, and relies too much on clunky metaphors and irritating anthropomorphisms. (For example, Kean writes that stars are ""[d]esperate to maintain high temperatures."" Stars are not sentient. They do not have feelings. Even more jaw-droppingly asinine, though, are sentences like ""In addition to Haber's being a Jew, Germany excommunicated him because he had become passé."" Do I need to break down why this is, at an absolute minimum, a tacky way of putting things?) He never actually fully explains how the periodic table works.More damningly to me, as a historian, is that Kean tries to write from a perspective which is determinedly presentist. His interest in the past seems to primarily stem from wanting to know the backstory of the discovery and refinement of certain scientific concepts, rather than any desire to engage with the history of science as an evolving conceptual system which is inevitably shaped by those who practice it. For a man who seems fascinated by the universe on scales both macro and micro, Kean seems profoundly uninterested in the human."
397,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"What Neil DeGrasse Tyson does for astronomy and David Attenborough does for zoology, Sam Kean does for chemistry and physics TOGETHER. There were a few times when the author simplified technical explanations, which I think made it more confusing. For that reason, I almost gave this book a 4. However there were enough moments where my mind was completely blown that I decided it had to be a 5. The first chapter is boring, but it is well worth pushing through. (What is it with science and very boring first chapters. Always. Start with something that draws me in for cryin' out loud!) There is a fascinating chapter on elements in times of war (Gold? Who needs gold? Give me molybdenum and tungsten.) and of course causing wars. A chapter that delves into lasers and masers (Holy shit, this was awesome! Seriously? How did I not know how lasers work? How did I learn all of the basic principles in physics, but I never learned how they come together in the most fantastic, brilliant way? I am happy to have rectified this situation.) and also the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a newish state of matter where a few thousand atoms becomes ""one giant marshmallow"" of an atom-a singularity and on a macro scale. This chapter ends with:""As technology keeps improving, scientists have gotten better and better at inducing matter to form the BEC. It's not like anyone's taking orders yet, but scientists might soon be able to build 'matter lasers' that shoot out ultra-focused beams of atoms thousands of times more powerful that light lasers, or construct 'supersolid' ice cubes that CAN FLOW THROUGH EACH OTHER WITHOUT LOSING THEIR SOLIDITY [emphasis mine]."" If I were a science teacher, the very next thing I would do after teaching this is have my students write a sci-fi story touching on where this technology is going next. What's it like to live in a world where solids can flow through each other? I know it's impossibly silly, but I immediately imagined humans that can walk through walls and stuff like that. Of course, this only happens at way below zero temperatures and on a very small scale. But you know, a girl can dream. There's also a chapter called ""Poisoner's Corridor: 'Ouch-Ouch'."" No need to elaborate. There's a chapter on elements as currency and of course fraud. There's even a section on how elements deceive our sense of taste-fascinating! (An example- chewing potassium gymnemate will make raw sugar heaped on your tongue taste like sand)Some other awesome tidbits:The person who discovered x-rays thought he went mad when he first saw the bones of his hands and a key hidden in a book. ""The primary component of taste, smell, is the only sense that bypasses our logical neural processing and connects directly to the brain's emotional centers.""""And whereas electrons absorb and emit light of the same color (yellow in, yellow out), fluorescent molecules absorb high-energy light (ultraviolet light) but emit that energy as lower-energy, visible light."" That's why we can see scorpions glow in the dark under black lights! This is what makes UV visible to us! The most powerful lasers today can produce beams that for a fraction of a second produce more power than the whole United States.Seriously, this book goes all over the place, but still manages to be organized. Loved it! "
398,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie,3,"""The Disappearing Spoon"" teaches the chemistry and physics of atoms and the periodic table. It's taught primarily in the context of short biographies about the Noble prize winning scientists (plus some others) who discovered the various elements or who discovered important things about how the elements or atoms are put together.Based on the book description I was given, I was expecting more trivia about the elements and how they are and have been used rather than a book teaching science with a main focus on scientists. However, the author's casual, lively, and sometimes crude tone made the stories entertaining--probably even more so to young males than to me. I did get a little tired of the author's judgmental attitude, though. It seemed like every human action had to be either brilliant or insanely stupid.The author's explanations of how things worked (atoms, periodic table, etc.) were easy for me to follow, but that might partly be because I took a lot of science courses in college. The initial science lessons were high school level, but the ending lessons were more college level (though high schoolers can probably follow them).The book primarily focused on science and scientists, but there were a few stories of invention, greed, destruction or just plain weirdness based around non-scientists. Though I didn't actually check to make sure, it seemed like every element on the periodic table was covered at least briefly. Some of the areas in which he discussed the use of the elements were warfare (chemical warfare, nuclear bombs, dirty bombs), medicine, politics, art, biology (especially DNA), as poison, as money (counterfeiting, a strange gold rush), and under super-cool conditions. He also covered a Big Bang model of how the elements were formed (with a ""see, no god needed!"" emphasis), how radiometric dating methods were thought up and used to generate dates for the age of the Earth that were old enough to give biological evolution a chance of occurring (since previous dating methods gave too ""young"" of an age to allow for it), and how biases can prevent critical viewing of scientific data (though he didn't seem to notice his own bias).He worked a lot of ""there is no God, humans & Earth aren't special, and evolution is true"" apologetics into this book. I wouldn't mind so much if, in the appendix, he hadn't presented what ""young-earth creationists believe"" by mixing true statements with misrepresented and apparently ridiculous ones as well as completely inaccurate ones. So now, if these readers come across the true argument, they'll dismiss it without really considering it--they'll think they know all about it when they don't.There were a few black and white photographs of scientists and a few charts. Overall, the book was entertaining and interesting, though not so much so that I'd want to read it again. The people who'd be most interested by it are probably teen or college age males who idolize science as pure and untarnished but who also like somewhat scandalous tales about scientists, their competitions to make Noble-winning discoveries, and their fights over who made a discovery first.I received this Advanced Reader Copy for review purposes from the publisher. "
399,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author relates many anecdotes of the discovery and uses of several elements with (as he says about those who know the periodic table) ""dweeby nonchalance.” It is meant to be a readable, interesting book of popular science for the lay reader, and indeed it is full of fascinating anecdotes about all things elemental. (The titular spoon is made of gallium, metal that melts in low temperatures and therefore a spoon made of it dissolves in tea. Ha ha, periodic table practical jokes!) Based on the title alone, I expected a lot of anecdotes such as the battle over the molybdenum mine in Colorado during WWII to help the Nazi war effort, or endless spats over naming rights of elements, but this book contains so much more. The madman Fritz Haber and his chlorine gas experiments; how the niobium in your cell phone helped finance the brutal Congo wars; an overview of the Bose-Einstein Condensate, the fifth state of matter; Henry Moseley’s electron beam; the alpha constant; why silicon-based life forms are extremely unlikely; Cobalt 60 dirty bombs; Monte Carlo science, itai-itai disease caused by Cadmium poisoning from mining companies on Japan; the role of gadolinium in MRI machines and cancer fighting; the left or right ""handedness"" of proteins; sulfur bacteria and how it relates to the sense of taste; the longest ""word"" ever, a technical term that is too long to be written; why we can unknowingly breathe in nitrogen without gasping for air until we suddenly collapse and die; why idolaters of Gandhi dislike iodine; how a lack of salt in a person suggests the nonexistence of the soul; how brass might be the nugget of truth behind the King Midas myth; how the science of bubbles led to the discovery of radon; and more. As you can see, the scope of this work is vast, possibly too much so. While it is written in a personable, conversational style, I felt that Kean doesn't manage to convey to the meanest scientific intelligence (namely me) a full understanding of the science he uses in the book, such as the aforementioned alpha constant, or how exactly electrons move from their ""shells."" Such information isn't necessary to appreciate the scientific history here, so for me it would have been better off cut entirely if impossible to simplify. I don't need the technical details to approve of a book that tells us that Lewis and Clark's route can be traced by the trace mercury in their feces, or refers to a Mark Twain story in which Satan is depicted as being made of radium, or that Paul McCartney was awarded a rhodium record (rather than gold or platinum) for his unsurpassed sales. That's the stuff that keeps the lay reader in their seats."
400,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Sam Kean has written a witty, interesting book about the elements in the Periodic Table. He writes as if he was chatting with the reader in a coffee shop or a tavern, regaling his friends with one anecdote after another. He's imparting his knowledge of science by the use of quirky, fun facts and interesting stories about the scientists involved.This is not set up like a typical chemistry textbook. The chapters are divided into areas of interest such as astronomy, poisons, money, war, medicine, and periods of history. The author is a physicist so the book had a lot of information about elements made in the lab, radioactive elements, nuclear chemistry, and the atomic bomb. For me, that was the most challenging part of the book.He writes about Linus Pauling's theory of a triple helix being trumped by James Watson and Francis Crick's double helix model of DNA. The attractive Marie Curie was a source of gossip when she took men into dark closets to show them radioactive specimens. Ghandhi told the people of India to dry their own salt instead of paying a British salt tax, only to have many people develop goiter due to lack of iodine. The trail taken by Lewis and Clark is known because anthropologists found (poisonous) mercury capsules that the explorers were using as laxatives. These types of stories make science seem more approachable.The title of the book comes from a practical joke. Gallium, which resembles aluminum, is a solid below 84 degrees F, and can be molded into a spoon. When it is dipped into hot tea, the surprised guest finds the spoon disappearing as it melts away. (Youtube has some ""disappearing spoon"" videos.)This is a book that can be enjoyed by the lay person as well as a scientist. Some chapters will be much easier to understand if a reader has had an introduction to the Periodic Table, such as in a high school Chemistry course. I would have preferred having the footnotes on the bottom of the pages rather than in the back of the book. Overall, the author should be commended for making science fun."
401,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3096541-amy,4,"I have to confess I didn't pay much attention to chemistry. Once the instructor talked about electrons, protons, atoms and the nucleus I usually turned on my Walkman (the cassette kind, now antique!). It never seemed interesting because it wasn't something that related at all to real life. If I had a teacher like Sam Kean, however, that could have been different.Fast forward too many years, and now I'm engrossed in this nonfiction 'memoir' of the Periodic Table of Elements. Like any good biography, this has scandal, lies, fraud, madness, explosions (!!!) and lots of name-dropping. Kean explains just what the periodic table is, but in a format that reads more like a novel, with anecdotal details to liven it up. Mercury pills were used by Lewis and Clark for their health? Yep, and you can trace their path (um, at least their bathroom trips on their journey) by where scientists have found unusually high amounts of mercury in the soil. The poet Robert Lowell? Did lithium ruin his work by making him sane? Who knew the lies and fraud and mind games played by scientists intent on getting a Nobel Prize! There's no getting around it, this is a book that makes you think. It's not simple and it assumes you have a basic knowledge of science. Some areas were over my head, but not for long. Kean is a wonderful teacher with a sassy wise guy voice that livens up any of the deeper areas."
402,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47354-dave,4,"For me this book was a pleasure to listen to. I plan to read a paper or e-book edition shortly. A delightful, an engaging blend of lyrical prose, historic anecdotes and fascinating information. Reminiscent, to me, of some of the writing of Lewis Thomas, Oliver Sacks, Barry Lopez, Edward Abbey and John McPhee.Brain/mind candy or chicken soup for the nerd's soul. Does that make me a dualist?The chapter essays are wide ranging anecdotal expositions of elements and families of elements. Not only stories about the scientists who prospected for and predicted the existence of certain elements, and created schemata for organizing them but about the influence of various elements on cultures, politics, economics and even philosophy. The stories added greatly to my appreciation for and understanding of the lives and work of some well known and some no longer famous scientists. The meditations on peculiar properties of some groups of atoms and alternative arrangements for the Periodic Table bumped my rating of the book from between 4 and 5 stars to clearly 5 stars. Others not so smitten on the history of science and mathematics may find it only mildly interesting or even boring. A must read for nerds, history buffs and fans of creative non-fiction. "
403,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2968341-linda-isakson,5,"I don't normally review non-fiction reads, but this one is just too superb to pass up! A wonderful and engaging read from cover-to-cover. Sam Kean takes the periodic table of the elements, a chart that makes most people cringe at thoughts of high school (or college) chemistry, and turns it into a riveting drama about the table's origins and the hunt to find new elements. Science geeks will love the scientific jargon but you don't need a degree in chemistry to understand the fascinating stories behind the revolutionaries responsible for our modern day technologies. This is definitely a book you can read over and over and still find little morsels you might have previously missed. Kean is amusing, insightful and presents complex information in a very understable package. A must read for fans of scientific history."
404,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18206572-inken,4,"I really enjoyed this book – even the parts I couldn’t understand. I so wish we’d had this as a set text when I took chemistry in high school. Not only might I have understood the rubbish our teacher was spouting, I might’ve liked it and even passed the bloody thing! Nobody ever even bothered to explain the Periodic Table to us and why it looks the way it does. And it's true: watching a gallium spoon dissolve in a glass of water is pretty cool.I had no idea the world of chemistry and physics was such a hotbed of rivalry, gossip and scandal. Delicious stuff."
405,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80835-celeste-ng,0,"Fascinating to me as the daughter of a chemist--I grew up with periodic tables all around, quite literally (I had a periodic table placemat!). Some of these stories were familiar to me, but most were new. Highly recommended for those who want to why the periodic table matters, and to know more about how the elements have changed human lives, sometimes drastically."
406,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40823165-yibbie,1," Never would I have assumed that I would have to quit reading a book about chemistry because of a lewd scene, but I did. In his attempt to introduce us to different chemicals and explain their lives, the author personifies them as characters in a smutty romance. So I quit what was up till then, an interesting book. "
407,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,5,"I’ve been reading a lot of non-fiction lately, and for me, that’s really...well, unusual. If you had asked me a couple of years ago how I felt about non-fiction, I would have described it as eye-glazingly dull, a dry recitation of facts. But now I eagerly scour the non-fiction shelves at the library. I know -- it’s crazy!The only explanation is that non-fiction has gotten better. (It can’t be me that’s changed.) The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean is a fine example of this better, more interesting non-fiction. Kean doesn’t skimp on the facts. He’s packed his book with oodles of information about the elements. What saves his book from being merely a mind-numbing collection of elemental characteristics may be gleaned from the book’s full title: The Disappearing Spoon and Other Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of Elements.Yes, it’s the madness and weirdness that brings the elements to life, and Kean seems to have dug up a fascinating story for virtually every element on the periodic table. For example, the title’s disappearing spoon refers to a (nerdy) practical joke in which unsuspecting victims are given a gallium spoon to stir their tea. I was particularly interested in the stories surrounding the radioactive elements, which ranged from an ex-KGB spy that was murdered with polonium-laced sushi in 2006 to a boy scout that tried to build his own nuclear reactor.Reading non-fiction like this is not only painless, but fun, and I’m convinced that I’m retaining all of those pesky little facts better that I normally would because I’ve so enjoyed learning them. Just wait until we meet at the next dinner party and I regale you with tales of elemental hijinks. If you’ve long despaired of enjoying non-fiction, perhaps now is the time to give it another try. "
408,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,4,"I pretty much knew I was going to like this book as soon as I heard about it. I mean, come on, it's about science! Some of the factoids I learned in this book will stick with me for a long time, like the naturally occurring nuclear reactor in Africa, or the reason why the Washington monument is capped with aluminum. At first I was disappointed that the book had end notes instead of footnotes. I do like footnotes. However, many of them were so long that I understood the reason for it. I ended up just having two bookmarks, one for where I was in the book, and one for where I was in the end notes.On one hand, there were sections that I feel I would have liked better if it hadn't been so long since my last chemistry class. On the other hand, if I were more well-versed in chemistry, some of the stories wouldn't have been so new and interesting to me.There were one or two slow sections in this book, but the interesting sections more than balanced it out. More to the point, this was a book that made me feel smarter for having read it--that goes a long way.One minor quibble that bothered me is that while there were two blank periodic tables which I found quickly, the actual periodic table in the book comes so close to the end that I wasn't able to find it, and I was looking for one. I would have liked to have one to reference. By the time I found it, I was almost done with the book and didn't need it as much. If the periodic table had been printed as an end paper, or in the beginning, or even at the start of the end notes where I could have found it, that would have made it easier to understand some of what the author talked about. After all, it's been a while since high school chemistry, and I only look at that chart periodically. (ha ha)"
409,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1951489-amanda,4,"Think back to your high school chemistry class. Chances are, the artwork adorning the classroom probably contained a poster with the periodic table of the elements. For some reason, all through 7 chemistry classes, my favorite was tungsten.Pop quiz - what is the chemical symbol for tungsten? Why, ""W"" of course! Why not T or Tu or Tg?? The ""W""is for wolfram, the German name for tungsten. Without it, those handy incandescent lightbulbs would not operate if it weren't for those tungsten filaments.I've always had a soft spot for science trivia, and the periodic table of the elements is full of interesting stories. If you have the same soft spot, I'd recommend ""The Disappearing Spoon"" by Sam Keane. The title references a property of the element gallium. Gallium turns from a solid to a liquid at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the author, a favorite prank of grad students is to fashion spoons made of gallium and to hand them out with tea or coffee. The spoon looks like the metal of other silverware, but when used in tea or coffee, melts away - a disappearing spoon!Another reason this is a great book is that it humanizes many of the famous scientists. In reading through textbooks, you never see into the personal lives or professional struggles of the discoveries and constants described in the text. Yet in The Disappearing Spoon, you see the races to get published (discovering and naming rights to elements), the discouragement at being passed up for a Nobel Prize yet again, and how wars and politics shape the or stunt technology."

I went to Barnes & Noble the other day with the wife, ostensibly to get a cup of coffee, and picked up this book and Jose Saramago's 'The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'. I couldn't tell you what it was about it that caught my attention. I'm doing that thing again where I read too many books at once, but despite my inward pleas to the contrary, I couldn't resist picking it up and starting to read. What a great book. Refreshing, endlessly intriguing. Every page was a pleasure. Basically a book like this tells me two things: what a whiny spoiled brat I am, and what a complete dimwitted ape I am. In these pages I read about a woman who rode horseback for 1200 miles through a Russian winter to get her kid to a college only to see him rejected, and she then rode 400 more miles to get him to yet another school after which she promptly, and understandably, died. That's just so Russian. Then I read about a man who not only invented the Bunsen burner, he also invented the Spectrometer, and subsequently discovered several new elements, all in the 1850s. I look at myself and realize I'm liable to get suicidal if we run out of half and half, and my greatest achievement in life has been to arrange The Police's 'Roxanne' for the ukulele. Sometimes a good dose of perspective is extremely illuminating. "

Then The Disappearing Spoon might be the book for you.This book is exactly what it is made out to be. With a full title of The Disappearing Spoon And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, it tells you everything you should know. Kean starts with the periodic table, talks about how it was created, and from there, tells of fun, tragic, or interesting stories about all of the elements.Most of the science in The Disappearing Spoon is understandable with a high-school knowledge of chemistry. But even if you don't know enough chemistry, those parts can easily be skipped. Most of the book is heavily inspired by scientific history, rather than science itself. If you want to know more about the bickering and rivalries between chemists, this book is perfect. The Disappearing Spoon is highly entertaining, and it's clear the author has done extensive research into the lives of the scientists he talks about. My only gripe is that he has the tendency to lose direction sometimes, and flounders between all of the threads of stories he started, no longer clear on exactly what point he wanted to make. "

This is at times a ""cute book"" but in spite of it's promise it will help you if you have a deep abiding love of chemistry before you crack it open.It doesn't really appear to be organized all that well and isn't truly geared to the average reader. He opens up with his early fascination with mercury (the element, not the planet or the mythological deity) and how it led him into literature etc. Then he sets out to induce us all into the wonder/wonders that is/are the periodic table. I wasn't drawn into chemistry beyond what's required in high school, neither was I here. It didn't work, I lost interest quickly and wasn't interested in going on with the class.Enjoy if it's cup of tea...not mine. Maybe you'll like it, but I can't recommend it."

If you're a full-fledged science geek, this could be a relatively light side read. If you're more of a layman, it's an opportunity to read some science that shouldn't be too far over your head, most of the time. I fall in the latter category. I wouldn't exactly call this a light read (though it's certainly easier going than some books that I've attempted) but the personable tone and fascinating stories kept me interested even when the going got a little tough. For a more science literate reader, those same stories would probably make it easier to get through the more familiar territory without getting bored. So yes, I did have fun, and I learned a few things, and I gave my brain a bit of a workout. Which is exactly what I like to see in a book about science."

This book especially incited fond memories from my college days when we were consuming chemistry and its historical progress. I still have my periodic table poster that hung next to my bed for a good part of last decade. It was fun to read anecdotes, vignettes and author's own dealings with elements. The writing is casual, occasionally whimsical, terribly nostalgic and overall interesting. Though Kean refrains from overt use of technical jargon, it just isn't possible to escape it completely. With a dose of nostalgia, I enjoyed reading this."

This one is all about the Periodic Table of Elements, and stories about every single element. Some get star treatment, but even ultra-rare Francium gets a shout out. The science is good and the writer doesn't dumb things down too much. He also makes excellent use of foot notes which provide great asides as well as jumping off points for further reading. "

417,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"This is a relatively slim book, but it’s packed with super interesting stories you never learned in chemistry, like:1) Scientists tracked the path of Lewis & Clark across America by looking for mercury deposits. The party took mercury tablets to “cure” ailments, and wherever they went #2, they left mercury in the soil2) 7 different elements were discovered in Ytterby, a tiny suburban town in Sweden3) the elements in the periodic table haven’t always been around: originally, there was just hydrogen. Through a variety of reactions, hydrogen (the simplest element) produced all other elements on the periodic table in our solar system. (This makes me wonder: what do other solar systems look like, elementally? Did they experience the same reactions yielding the same elements, or an entirely different set?)4) the creator of the death gas used in WW2 concentration camps, Zyklon B (well, the first version anyway, named Zyklon A—it got slightly tweaked) was Franz Haber, a Jewish man famous for killing many Allied soldiers in painful chemical ways during WWI. Zyklon B was later used to murder thousands of people, including Haber’s own relatives5) Two elements called niobium and tantalum (named after Niobe and Tantalus from Greek myth) are found in the the Congo, combined in a rock called coltan. Niobium and tantalum are metals used in cell phones. The huge demand for coltan in the late 1990s/early 2000s caused anarchy and devastation in the Congo6) A scientist named Seaborg who worked on the Manhattan Project discovered the elements americium (which powers smoke detectors, by the way) and curium in 1946. Rather than announcing it in a scientific journal, Seaborg announced it on a children’s show, Quiz Kids (a child asked Seaborg if he’d discovered any new elements lately, and he explained that he had; judging by the mail he received from schoolchildren, teachers across the globe refused to believe the children’s claims the next week in school)7) the first antibacterial drug wasn’t penicillin (the first antibiotic)—in 1932, a man named Domagk discovered that Prontosil, an industrial dye, could be injected into a sick person to cure them of a bacterial infection (Domagk initially made this discovery on mice; when his daughter Hildegarde tripped while holding a sewing needle and acquired a life-threatening infection, Domagk gave it a whirl in humans, and she got better)8) Tellurium smells strongly of garlic. Beryllium tastes like sugar (despite being a toxic metal). Potassium tastes like salt!9) the European Union, appropriately, uses europium in the ink on euros to show they’re not counterfeit10) In the African nation of Gabon, there exists the only natural nuclear fission reactor known to exist, called Oklo—fueled by uranium, blue-green algae (pond scum), and plain water (the only reason there’s not a gigantic hole burned into Gabon? When the uranium reaches critical mass, it boils off the water, and without the water, the reaction stops). My favourite chapter was chapter 9 (on poisonous elements) because poison is cool. I was especially interested in how a local doctor (Noboru Hagino) discovered that cadmium was poisoning the people of Kamioka, Japan: with the help of a public health professor, he plotted the homes of all the people who came down with the mysterious disease (known as itai-itai, or “ouch ouch” disease), and was able to discover that they all lived along the Jinzu River, which carried cadmium, a waste product from the local mine. This reminded me a lot of The Ghost Map, which, as in the case of Kamioka, tells the story of how a local doctor and a public health professional teamed up to trace the root of a deadly disease (cholera, in that case) using mapping. (Speaking of London—I was also interested to see Alexander Litvinenko, murdered by polonium-spiked tea in a London sushi restaurant, get a mention; I recently saw his grave in Highgate Cemetery). Definitely a fun read if you have a spare afternoon and wish you knew the more fun side of chemistry."
418,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4053034-laura,1,"I didn't finish this book. I couldn't finish this book because the parts of this book that are about science I know could most generously be described as ""missleading at best"". If that's the case about the stuff I know, how much is true in the stuff I don't know? I'm called upon to teach some chemistry despite the fact my real chemistry knowledge pretty much ends at physical chemistry and astrochemistry - so I really don't need to fill my head with stories and theories that are pale reflections of the current state of knowledge when I don't read enough of the literature to judge how correct they are.I'm not sure where the author looked up the theory of solar system formation he gives in Chapter 4, but it wasn't in anything written in the last 20 years. If he'd turned in what's written here on an astronomy exam when I was in a generous mood I might give him a point or two for having a couple of right ideas in there, but he'd still have an F.I started to get a clue there was a problem when the author called the collision of comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 (1993 F2) with Jupiter ""intergalactic"". Huh? How is the collision of two solar system objects intergalactic? There's no evidence that SL9 was an extra-solar comet, much less an extra-galactic comet, but ok, he's using an odd hyperbole to make it sound more exciting. Overall the book has a very bubbly, casual style to it so I'll let him use this oddly chosen word. Things get worse however, when he implies Jupiter is the reason C/Hale-Bopp (1995 O1) came into the inner solar system. At this point I'm still assuming he knows that is not true and he's wording things really poorly, but I'm beginning to doubt I know enough of the science in other parts of the book to be able to see through this sort of thing elsewhere. However, it's when he writes ""Because the stellar wind blew only the lightest, most common elements as far out as Jupiter, it should have the same basic elemental composition as real stars"", that I pause and make a WTF!?! note in the margin. It takes me half a lecture or more to explain our current understanding of solar system formation, so I won't go through it all in this review, but the above is pure nonsense. More pure nonsense occurs when he mentions that the cloud of gas and dust our solar system formed out of was flat. There's no evidence for that and it's extremely unlikely dynamically. Simple physics flattens any shape of cloud collapsing under gravity to a spinning disk.Coming back to the missleading at best parts, we are told there are apparently mini-nuclear booms in stars counterbalancing gravity rather than thermal pressure. Booms implies a series of nuclear bombs going off when it is actually the steady rate of fusion in the interior of the Sun that causes the thermal pressure that balances gravity. Finally, given that I'm a planetary scientist, I just can't let slide the description of the Moon forming due to an ""asteroid or comet impact"". Well ok. If you want to call a roughly Mars sized planetesimal an asteroid or comet. However, there aren't any Mars sized planetesimals left that we'd call an asteroid or comet today. Mars is really in no danger of being demoted from planet-hood.I haven't picked on every problem with the astrophysics presented in this chapter, but all this and more brings me to the end of Chapter 4 with no trust the author knows anything about what he's talking about. This is likely not true given all the glowing reviews, one even appearing in the well respected journal Nature (I'm guessing a review by a chemist that knew no astronomy?). But having lost my trust it can't be regained, and I won't be finishing this book."
419,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9255064-melissa,4,"Chemistry has never been my thing. I hated it in high school (except for the part where we melted mechanical pencils over the Bunsen burner). Recently watching the chemistry Crash Course episodes has reminded me that chemistry is not just the boring science class I struggled to stay awake through in high school. Chemistry is everything around us and understanding a bit about it will help me better understand the way the world works.So I picked up The Disappearing Spoon with that in mind and was richly rewarded. Kean’s writing style was fun and made the subject matter interesting. He talks not only about the science behind each element, but about the scientists who discovered them and the impact they had on the world. For example Mendeleev, who is credited with creating the Periodic Table, had a fascinating start. He was born in Siberia, the youngest of 11 children. His father died when he was only 13 and his mother worked incredibly hard to give him the chance to go to school. Imagine having to overcome all of those things just to be able to go to school! Another favorite of mine was Marie Curie. Her fascinating life, including a marriage that was far ahead of its time and the discovery of multiple elements was so interesting. She won a Nobel Prize in a time when women in America weren’t even allowed to vote. I would love to a biography that focused solely on her.The periodic table has changed the world in both positive and negative ways. Kean doesn’t shy away from the damage that’s been done because of the discovery of a new element. He talks about the effects of vaccinations and medicines and also at the way chemistry made things like the atom bomb possible. When cell phones became wildly popular in the 1990s the fight to find more of the metal used to create them caused the Congo to explode with fighting. People were in a frenzy to provide the metal that was in such high demand. “Overall more than 5 million people have died in Congo since the mid-1990s, making it the biggest waste of life since World War II. The fighting there is proof that in addition to all the uplifting moments the Periodic table has inspired it can also play on humankind's worst, most inhumane instincts.”This balanced look at the Table reminds us that with great knowledge (just like great power) comes great responsibility. Almost any scientific advance can be used for good or bad and there will always be a struggle to use it correctly. BOTTOM LINE: The most interesting book I’ve read ever read about chemistry and one that kept me intrigued the entire time. We live in a truly remarkable world and I’ll never regret reading a book that opens up a new corner of that world to me."
420,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/981514-minli,4,"Entertaining read--and a fascinating subject matter. I'm definitely the right audience for this book: someone who knows some chemistry but didn't get any higher degrees in it, and is more interested in the historical, cultural building of the periodic table than the hard science.Kean's wry prose never lets you forget that his point of view is subjective and conversational: he paints caricatures of famous scientists and makes ridiculous analogies. His audience is undoubtedly American. He does his best to explain concepts (some of which I still remembered!) in layman's terms, though I kind of dozed off at the discussion of alpha. He does a good job giving awesome lady scientists their due, like Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin, Maria Groppert-Mayer and Marie Curie. I learned a bunch of things, how thallium is the worst ever poison (the poisoner's poison) and that cobalt-60 is the dirtiest and worst ever a-bomb. The structuring of the elements grouped into chapters, chapters grouped into parts, gave the book a flow and rhythm. It might have benefited from a longer conclusion.This book has made me feel like the biggest dork ever, because when people mention some element now, I have to squash the impulse to say, ""Hey! Did you know that...""The Disappearing Spoon also showed to me what my chemistry, biology and physics teachers in high school and college never did: how magical, weird, wonderful, temperamental, dangerous and dramatic science can be, how they're heterogeneously mixed with Romance and politics. I wish I'd had this book in high school."
421,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19832185-thomas-frank,4,"As someone who never took chemistry, I found this book to provide just enough of the basics about the periodic table to enable me to sound at least a bit better than completely ignorant when talking about the subject. Beyond that, it's filled with interesting stories about the people who helped build the table and discover many of its elements, as well as other events that revolve around said elements. I particularly enjoyed the one about Germany's clandestine operations in the U.S. during WWI.One nitpick I had with this book: Every 2-3 pages, you'll find an asterisk that corresponds to a footnote in the back of the book. I'm the kind of person who simply cannot ignore these, and as a result, constantly going to the back of the book to read them made it a bit harder for me to immerse myself in the main text. Now, this is mainly the fault of my own brain, so I'm not subtracting anything from my score for it. Just be aware of this fact if you happen to be like me. Personally, I think the footnotes would have been less distracting if they were put on the actual page where they were referenced.Still, this book was really enjoyable. I look forward to digging into Kean's newer works when I've got some time."
422,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge,3,"Audiobook narrated by Sean Runnette. Subtitle: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the ElementsWho could have imagined such a volume written about that chart that hangs in every high school chemistry classroom? I’m an admitted science geek. I loved the “Mr Wizard” TV show when I was a kid. (He encouraged us to perform all sorts of experiments using our mother’s kitchen utensils and supplies.) I never wanted a Barbie doll, I wanted a chemistry set and a microscope! So, I’ve had this book on my TBR list since it first came out. And I have to say that I’m a little disappointed.It’s not that Kean is a bad writer; he isn’t, and he’s quite thorough in exploring this topic. His enthusiasm and fascination for the periodic table comes through. But, it was just too much even for this science geek. Some parts were far more interesting to me than others. I loved the chapter on poisons, for example. I was less enthralled with the political infighting on what name to give to a newly discovered element. Also, I made the choice to listen to the audio format. Sean Runnette did a fine job of performing the audio. However, the sometimes dry subject matter made for a more difficult listening experience. I might have enjoyed this more in text."
423,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3349963-craig-cottingham,4,"I was a chemical engineering major in college, so some of the background information (like the basics of the periodic table) was familiar to me and therefore a little tedious to read. Outside of that, however, this was a fascinating book that I think would be accessible to non-beakerheads.Each chapter is devoted to a group of elements that are related. Instead of going for the obvious groupings (the inert gasses, the halogens, etc.) he comes at them from a refreshingly sideways direction. There's a chapter on poisons (from the obvious like arsenic, to thallium, which was responsible for thousands of deaths from contaminated groundwater in Japan) and another on measurements (from the international standard kilogram, which is an ingot of iridium, to the cesium-powered atomic clocks which define the international standard second). Each one reads a little like an episode of James Burke's TV series Connections, the way the discussion of one element blends into another. Sometimes the connections and the groupings are a little contrived, but not jarringly so, and I'm sure it was necessary to avoid a ""here are all the elements that didn't fit in anywhere else"" chapter.Highly recommended."
424,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"There’s a lot packed into this book. I enjoyed the look of the history of the periodic table; how it got started, the changes made over time, the discoveries of elements. Intermingled are the stories of the people; the scientists who figured things out and made things happen. Intertwined yet again are the stories of the theory and workings of atoms; what makes them tick, what makes them unique, what makes them react. Then there’s all those scientists; some humorous, some deceitful or crazy for fame. I really enjoyed the bit about the periodic table in the future and how the table if ever-changing and expanding. This is a wonderful book for those who enjoy chemistry, physics and anything “earthy”. "
425,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Fun romp through the periodic table - lots of chemistry and physics, but even more stories about science and the people who do it. Sam Kean has fun with history. The book is not very technical, but approachable and occasionally humorous. The stories are diverse - there are many elements on the table, so we jump around quite a bit. I enjoyed this on audio, found it both educational and entertaining, but I probably won’t remember much as there is no common storyline other than the stories being about elements."
426,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,2,"Uneven and only fitfully engaging, The Disappearing Spoon is less a history of the periodic table and how scientists have come to understand elemental matter than it is a collection of facts about those elements and anecdotes about the various researchers who've discovered them. Sam Kean doesn't really have the knack for explaining (or re-explaining) scientific concepts to people who haven't studied chemistry or physics since secondary school, and relies too much on clunky metaphors and irritating anthropomorphisms. (For example, Kean writes that stars are ""[d]esperate to maintain high temperatures."" Stars are not sentient. They do not have feelings. Even more jaw-droppingly asinine, though, are sentences like ""In addition to Haber's being a Jew, Germany excommunicated him because he had become passé."" Do I need to break down why this is, at an absolute minimum, a tacky way of putting things?) He never actually fully explains how the periodic table works.More damningly to me, as a historian, is that Kean tries to write from a perspective which is determinedly presentist. His interest in the past seems to primarily stem from wanting to know the backstory of the discovery and refinement of certain scientific concepts, rather than any desire to engage with the history of science as an evolving conceptual system which is inevitably shaped by those who practice it. For a man who seems fascinated by the universe on scales both macro and micro, Kean seems profoundly uninterested in the human."
427,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"What Neil DeGrasse Tyson does for astronomy and David Attenborough does for zoology, Sam Kean does for chemistry and physics TOGETHER. There were a few times when the author simplified technical explanations, which I think made it more confusing. For that reason, I almost gave this book a 4. However there were enough moments where my mind was completely blown that I decided it had to be a 5. The first chapter is boring, but it is well worth pushing through. (What is it with science and very boring first chapters. Always. Start with something that draws me in for cryin' out loud!) There is a fascinating chapter on elements in times of war (Gold? Who needs gold? Give me molybdenum and tungsten.) and of course causing wars. A chapter that delves into lasers and masers (Holy shit, this was awesome! Seriously? How did I not know how lasers work? How did I learn all of the basic principles in physics, but I never learned how they come together in the most fantastic, brilliant way? I am happy to have rectified this situation.) and also the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a newish state of matter where a few thousand atoms becomes ""one giant marshmallow"" of an atom-a singularity and on a macro scale. This chapter ends with:""As technology keeps improving, scientists have gotten better and better at inducing matter to form the BEC. It's not like anyone's taking orders yet, but scientists might soon be able to build 'matter lasers' that shoot out ultra-focused beams of atoms thousands of times more powerful that light lasers, or construct 'supersolid' ice cubes that CAN FLOW THROUGH EACH OTHER WITHOUT LOSING THEIR SOLIDITY [emphasis mine]."" If I were a science teacher, the very next thing I would do after teaching this is have my students write a sci-fi story touching on where this technology is going next. What's it like to live in a world where solids can flow through each other? I know it's impossibly silly, but I immediately imagined humans that can walk through walls and stuff like that. Of course, this only happens at way below zero temperatures and on a very small scale. But you know, a girl can dream. There's also a chapter called ""Poisoner's Corridor: 'Ouch-Ouch'."" No need to elaborate. There's a chapter on elements as currency and of course fraud. There's even a section on how elements deceive our sense of taste-fascinating! (An example- chewing potassium gymnemate will make raw sugar heaped on your tongue taste like sand)Some other awesome tidbits:The person who discovered x-rays thought he went mad when he first saw the bones of his hands and a key hidden in a book. ""The primary component of taste, smell, is the only sense that bypasses our logical neural processing and connects directly to the brain's emotional centers.""""And whereas electrons absorb and emit light of the same color (yellow in, yellow out), fluorescent molecules absorb high-energy light (ultraviolet light) but emit that energy as lower-energy, visible light."" That's why we can see scorpions glow in the dark under black lights! This is what makes UV visible to us! The most powerful lasers today can produce beams that for a fraction of a second produce more power than the whole United States.Seriously, this book goes all over the place, but still manages to be organized. Loved it! "
428,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie,3,"""The Disappearing Spoon"" teaches the chemistry and physics of atoms and the periodic table. It's taught primarily in the context of short biographies about the Noble prize winning scientists (plus some others) who discovered the various elements or who discovered important things about how the elements or atoms are put together.Based on the book description I was given, I was expecting more trivia about the elements and how they are and have been used rather than a book teaching science with a main focus on scientists. However, the author's casual, lively, and sometimes crude tone made the stories entertaining--probably even more so to young males than to me. I did get a little tired of the author's judgmental attitude, though. It seemed like every human action had to be either brilliant or insanely stupid.The author's explanations of how things worked (atoms, periodic table, etc.) were easy for me to follow, but that might partly be because I took a lot of science courses in college. The initial science lessons were high school level, but the ending lessons were more college level (though high schoolers can probably follow them).The book primarily focused on science and scientists, but there were a few stories of invention, greed, destruction or just plain weirdness based around non-scientists. Though I didn't actually check to make sure, it seemed like every element on the periodic table was covered at least briefly. Some of the areas in which he discussed the use of the elements were warfare (chemical warfare, nuclear bombs, dirty bombs), medicine, politics, art, biology (especially DNA), as poison, as money (counterfeiting, a strange gold rush), and under super-cool conditions. He also covered a Big Bang model of how the elements were formed (with a ""see, no god needed!"" emphasis), how radiometric dating methods were thought up and used to generate dates for the age of the Earth that were old enough to give biological evolution a chance of occurring (since previous dating methods gave too ""young"" of an age to allow for it), and how biases can prevent critical viewing of scientific data (though he didn't seem to notice his own bias).He worked a lot of ""there is no God, humans & Earth aren't special, and evolution is true"" apologetics into this book. I wouldn't mind so much if, in the appendix, he hadn't presented what ""young-earth creationists believe"" by mixing true statements with misrepresented and apparently ridiculous ones as well as completely inaccurate ones. So now, if these readers come across the true argument, they'll dismiss it without really considering it--they'll think they know all about it when they don't.There were a few black and white photographs of scientists and a few charts. Overall, the book was entertaining and interesting, though not so much so that I'd want to read it again. The people who'd be most interested by it are probably teen or college age males who idolize science as pure and untarnished but who also like somewhat scandalous tales about scientists, their competitions to make Noble-winning discoveries, and their fights over who made a discovery first.I received this Advanced Reader Copy for review purposes from the publisher. "
429,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author relates many anecdotes of the discovery and uses of several elements with (as he says about those who know the periodic table) ""dweeby nonchalance.” It is meant to be a readable, interesting book of popular science for the lay reader, and indeed it is full of fascinating anecdotes about all things elemental. (The titular spoon is made of gallium, metal that melts in low temperatures and therefore a spoon made of it dissolves in tea. Ha ha, periodic table practical jokes!) Based on the title alone, I expected a lot of anecdotes such as the battle over the molybdenum mine in Colorado during WWII to help the Nazi war effort, or endless spats over naming rights of elements, but this book contains so much more. The madman Fritz Haber and his chlorine gas experiments; how the niobium in your cell phone helped finance the brutal Congo wars; an overview of the Bose-Einstein Condensate, the fifth state of matter; Henry Moseley’s electron beam; the alpha constant; why silicon-based life forms are extremely unlikely; Cobalt 60 dirty bombs; Monte Carlo science, itai-itai disease caused by Cadmium poisoning from mining companies on Japan; the role of gadolinium in MRI machines and cancer fighting; the left or right ""handedness"" of proteins; sulfur bacteria and how it relates to the sense of taste; the longest ""word"" ever, a technical term that is too long to be written; why we can unknowingly breathe in nitrogen without gasping for air until we suddenly collapse and die; why idolaters of Gandhi dislike iodine; how a lack of salt in a person suggests the nonexistence of the soul; how brass might be the nugget of truth behind the King Midas myth; how the science of bubbles led to the discovery of radon; and more. As you can see, the scope of this work is vast, possibly too much so. While it is written in a personable, conversational style, I felt that Kean doesn't manage to convey to the meanest scientific intelligence (namely me) a full understanding of the science he uses in the book, such as the aforementioned alpha constant, or how exactly electrons move from their ""shells."" Such information isn't necessary to appreciate the scientific history here, so for me it would have been better off cut entirely if impossible to simplify. I don't need the technical details to approve of a book that tells us that Lewis and Clark's route can be traced by the trace mercury in their feces, or refers to a Mark Twain story in which Satan is depicted as being made of radium, or that Paul McCartney was awarded a rhodium record (rather than gold or platinum) for his unsurpassed sales. That's the stuff that keeps the lay reader in their seats."
430,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Sam Kean has written a witty, interesting book about the elements in the Periodic Table. He writes as if he was chatting with the reader in a coffee shop or a tavern, regaling his friends with one anecdote after another. He's imparting his knowledge of science by the use of quirky, fun facts and interesting stories about the scientists involved.This is not set up like a typical chemistry textbook. The chapters are divided into areas of interest such as astronomy, poisons, money, war, medicine, and periods of history. The author is a physicist so the book had a lot of information about elements made in the lab, radioactive elements, nuclear chemistry, and the atomic bomb. For me, that was the most challenging part of the book.He writes about Linus Pauling's theory of a triple helix being trumped by James Watson and Francis Crick's double helix model of DNA. The attractive Marie Curie was a source of gossip when she took men into dark closets to show them radioactive specimens. Ghandhi told the people of India to dry their own salt instead of paying a British salt tax, only to have many people develop goiter due to lack of iodine. The trail taken by Lewis and Clark is known because anthropologists found (poisonous) mercury capsules that the explorers were using as laxatives. These types of stories make science seem more approachable.The title of the book comes from a practical joke. Gallium, which resembles aluminum, is a solid below 84 degrees F, and can be molded into a spoon. When it is dipped into hot tea, the surprised guest finds the spoon disappearing as it melts away. (Youtube has some ""disappearing spoon"" videos.)This is a book that can be enjoyed by the lay person as well as a scientist. Some chapters will be much easier to understand if a reader has had an introduction to the Periodic Table, such as in a high school Chemistry course. I would have preferred having the footnotes on the bottom of the pages rather than in the back of the book. Overall, the author should be commended for making science fun."
431,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3096541-amy,4,"I have to confess I didn't pay much attention to chemistry. Once the instructor talked about electrons, protons, atoms and the nucleus I usually turned on my Walkman (the cassette kind, now antique!). It never seemed interesting because it wasn't something that related at all to real life. If I had a teacher like Sam Kean, however, that could have been different.Fast forward too many years, and now I'm engrossed in this nonfiction 'memoir' of the Periodic Table of Elements. Like any good biography, this has scandal, lies, fraud, madness, explosions (!!!) and lots of name-dropping. Kean explains just what the periodic table is, but in a format that reads more like a novel, with anecdotal details to liven it up. Mercury pills were used by Lewis and Clark for their health? Yep, and you can trace their path (um, at least their bathroom trips on their journey) by where scientists have found unusually high amounts of mercury in the soil. The poet Robert Lowell? Did lithium ruin his work by making him sane? Who knew the lies and fraud and mind games played by scientists intent on getting a Nobel Prize! There's no getting around it, this is a book that makes you think. It's not simple and it assumes you have a basic knowledge of science. Some areas were over my head, but not for long. Kean is a wonderful teacher with a sassy wise guy voice that livens up any of the deeper areas."
432,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47354-dave,4,"For me this book was a pleasure to listen to. I plan to read a paper or e-book edition shortly. A delightful, an engaging blend of lyrical prose, historic anecdotes and fascinating information. Reminiscent, to me, of some of the writing of Lewis Thomas, Oliver Sacks, Barry Lopez, Edward Abbey and John McPhee.Brain/mind candy or chicken soup for the nerd's soul. Does that make me a dualist?The chapter essays are wide ranging anecdotal expositions of elements and families of elements. Not only stories about the scientists who prospected for and predicted the existence of certain elements, and created schemata for organizing them but about the influence of various elements on cultures, politics, economics and even philosophy. The stories added greatly to my appreciation for and understanding of the lives and work of some well known and some no longer famous scientists. The meditations on peculiar properties of some groups of atoms and alternative arrangements for the Periodic Table bumped my rating of the book from between 4 and 5 stars to clearly 5 stars. Others not so smitten on the history of science and mathematics may find it only mildly interesting or even boring. A must read for nerds, history buffs and fans of creative non-fiction. "
433,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2968341-linda-isakson,5,"I don't normally review non-fiction reads, but this one is just too superb to pass up! A wonderful and engaging read from cover-to-cover. Sam Kean takes the periodic table of the elements, a chart that makes most people cringe at thoughts of high school (or college) chemistry, and turns it into a riveting drama about the table's origins and the hunt to find new elements. Science geeks will love the scientific jargon but you don't need a degree in chemistry to understand the fascinating stories behind the revolutionaries responsible for our modern day technologies. This is definitely a book you can read over and over and still find little morsels you might have previously missed. Kean is amusing, insightful and presents complex information in a very understable package. A must read for fans of scientific history."

I so wish we’d had this as a set text when I took chemistry in high school. Not only might I have understood the rubbish our teacher was spouting, I might’ve liked it and even passed the bloody thing! Nobody ever even bothered to explain the Periodic Table to us and why it looks the way it does. And it's true: watching a gallium spoon dissolve in a glass of water is pretty cool.I had no idea the world of chemistry and physics was such a hotbed of rivalry, gossip and scandal. Delicious stuff."
435,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80835-celeste-ng,0,"Fascinating to me as the daughter of a chemist--I grew up with periodic tables all around, quite literally (I had a periodic table placemat!). Some of these stories were familiar to me, but most were new. Highly recommended for those who want to why the periodic table matters, and to know more about how the elements have changed human lives, sometimes drastically."

In his attempt to introduce us to different chemicals and explain their lives, the author personifies them as characters in a smutty romance. So I quit what was up till then, an interesting book. "
437,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,5,"I’ve been reading a lot of non-fiction lately, and for me, that’s really...well, unusual. If you had asked me a couple of years ago how I felt about non-fiction, I would have described it as eye-glazingly dull, a dry recitation of facts. But now I eagerly scour the non-fiction shelves at the library. I know -- it’s crazy!The only explanation is that non-fiction has gotten better. (It can’t be me that’s changed.) The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean is a fine example of this better, more interesting non-fiction. Kean doesn’t skimp on the facts. He’s packed his book with oodles of information about the elements. What saves his book from being merely a mind-numbing collection of elemental characteristics may be gleaned from the book’s full title: The Disappearing Spoon and Other Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of Elements.Yes, it’s the madness and weirdness that brings the elements to life, and Kean seems to have dug up a fascinating story for virtually every element on the periodic table. For example, the title’s disappearing spoon refers to a (nerdy) practical joke in which unsuspecting victims are given a gallium spoon to stir their tea. I was particularly interested in the stories surrounding the radioactive elements, which ranged from an ex-KGB spy that was murdered with polonium-laced sushi in 2006 to a boy scout that tried to build his own nuclear reactor.Reading non-fiction like this is not only painless, but fun, and I’m convinced that I’m retaining all of those pesky little facts better that I normally would because I’ve so enjoyed learning them. Just wait until we meet at the next dinner party and I regale you with tales of elemental hijinks. If you’ve long despaired of enjoying non-fiction, perhaps now is the time to give it another try. "

Some of the factoids I learned in this book will stick with me for a long time, like the naturally occurring nuclear reactor in Africa, or the reason why the Washington monument is capped with aluminum. At first I was disappointed that the book had end notes instead of footnotes. I do like footnotes. However, many of them were so long that I understood the reason for it. I ended up just having two bookmarks, one for where I was in the book, and one for where I was in the end notes.On one hand, there were sections that I feel I would have liked better if it hadn't been so long since my last chemistry class. On the other hand, if I were more well-versed in chemistry, some of the stories wouldn't have been so new and interesting to me.There were one or two slow sections in this book, but the interesting sections more than balanced it out. More to the point, this was a book that made me feel smarter for having read it--that goes a long way.One minor quibble that bothered me is that while there were two blank periodic tables which I found quickly, the actual periodic table in the book comes so close to the end that I wasn't able to find it, and I was looking for one. I would have liked to have one to reference. By the time I found it, I was almost done with the book and didn't need it as much. If the periodic table had been printed as an end paper, or in the beginning, or even at the start of the end notes where I could have found it, that would have made it easier to understand some of what the author talked about. After all, it's been a while since high school chemistry, and I only look at that chart periodically. (ha ha)"
439,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1951489-amanda,4,"Think back to your high school chemistry class. Chances are, the artwork adorning the classroom probably contained a poster with the periodic table of the elements. For some reason, all through 7 chemistry classes, my favorite was tungsten.Pop quiz - what is the chemical symbol for tungsten? Why, ""W"" of course! Why not T or Tu or Tg?? The ""W""is for wolfram, the German name for tungsten. Without it, those handy incandescent lightbulbs would not operate if it weren't for those tungsten filaments.I've always had a soft spot for science trivia, and the periodic table of the elements is full of interesting stories. If you have the same soft spot, I'd recommend ""The Disappearing Spoon"" by Sam Keane. The title references a property of the element gallium. Gallium turns from a solid to a liquid at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the author, a favorite prank of grad students is to fashion spoons made of gallium and to hand them out with tea or coffee. The spoon looks like the metal of other silverware, but when used in tea or coffee, melts away - a disappearing spoon!Another reason this is a great book is that it humanizes many of the famous scientists. In reading through textbooks, you never see into the personal lives or professional struggles of the discoveries and constants described in the text. Yet in The Disappearing Spoon, you see the races to get published (discovering and naming rights to elements), the discouragement at being passed up for a Nobel Prize yet again, and how wars and politics shape the or stunt technology."

I went to Barnes & Noble the other day with the wife, ostensibly to get a cup of coffee, and picked up this book and Jose Saramago's 'The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'. I couldn't tell you what it was about it that caught my attention. I'm doing that thing again where I read too many books at once, but despite my inward pleas to the contrary, I couldn't resist picking it up and starting to read. What a great book. Refreshing, endlessly intriguing. Every page was a pleasure. Basically a book like this tells me two things: what a whiny spoiled brat I am, and what a complete dimwitted ape I am. In these pages I read about a woman who rode horseback for 1200 miles through a Russian winter to get her kid to a college only to see him rejected, and she then rode 400 more miles to get him to yet another school after which she promptly, and understandably, died. That's just so Russian. Then I read about a man who not only invented the Bunsen burner, he also invented the Spectrometer, and subsequently discovered several new elements, all in the 1850s. I look at myself and realize I'm liable to get suicidal if we run out of half and half, and my greatest achievement in life has been to arrange The Police's 'Roxanne' for the ukulele. Sometimes a good dose of perspective is extremely illuminating. "

Then The Disappearing Spoon might be the book for you.This book is exactly what it is made out to be. With a full title of The Disappearing Spoon And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, it tells you everything you should know. Kean starts with the periodic table, talks about how it was created, and from there, tells of fun, tragic, or interesting stories about all of the elements.Most of the science in The Disappearing Spoon is understandable with a high-school knowledge of chemistry. But even if you don't know enough chemistry, those parts can easily be skipped. Most of the book is heavily inspired by scientific history, rather than science itself. If you want to know more about the bickering and rivalries between chemists, this book is perfect. The Disappearing Spoon is highly entertaining, and it's clear the author has done extensive research into the lives of the scientists he talks about. My only gripe is that he has the tendency to lose direction sometimes, and flounders between all of the threads of stories he started, no longer clear on exactly what point he wanted to make. "

This is at times a ""cute book"" but in spite of it's promise it will help you if you have a deep abiding love of chemistry before you crack it open.It doesn't really appear to be organized all that well and isn't truly geared to the average reader. He opens up with his early fascination with mercury (the element, not the planet or the mythological deity) and how it led him into literature etc. Then he sets out to induce us all into the wonder/wonders that is/are the periodic table. I wasn't drawn into chemistry beyond what's required in high school, neither was I here. It didn't work, I lost interest quickly and wasn't interested in going on with the class.Enjoy if it's cup of tea...not mine. Maybe you'll like it, but I can't recommend it."

If you're a full-fledged science geek, this could be a relatively light side read. If you're more of a layman, it's an opportunity to read some science that shouldn't be too far over your head, most of the time. I fall in the latter category. I wouldn't exactly call this a light read (though it's certainly easier going than some books that I've attempted) but the personable tone and fascinating stories kept me interested even when the going got a little tough. For a more science literate reader, those same stories would probably make it easier to get through the more familiar territory without getting bored. So yes, I did have fun, and I learned a few things, and I gave my brain a bit of a workout. Which is exactly what I like to see in a book about science."

This book especially incited fond memories from my college days when we were consuming chemistry and its historical progress. I still have my periodic table poster that hung next to my bed for a good part of last decade. It was fun to read anecdotes, vignettes and author's own dealings with elements. The writing is casual, occasionally whimsical, terribly nostalgic and overall interesting. Though Kean refrains from overt use of technical jargon, it just isn't possible to escape it completely. With a dose of nostalgia, I enjoyed reading this."
445,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5984690-sean-o,5,"One of the top non-fiction books I've read this year. It's full of exactly the kind of stories I like: scientists and other clever people finding out about the universe. This one is all about the Periodic Table of Elements, and stories about every single element. Some get star treatment, but even ultra-rare Francium gets a shout out. The science is good and the writer doesn't dumb things down too much. He also makes excellent use of foot notes which provide great asides as well as jumping off points for further reading. "
446,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999881-geoff,3,This book is filled with stories about the discoveries of the elements of the periodic table - some I knew and many I had never heard before. 
447,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"This is a relatively slim book, but it’s packed with super interesting stories you never learned in chemistry, like:1) Scientists tracked the path of Lewis & Clark across America by looking for mercury deposits. The party took mercury tablets to “cure” ailments, and wherever they went #2, they left mercury in the soil2) 7 different elements were discovered in Ytterby, a tiny suburban town in Sweden3) the elements in the periodic table haven’t always been around: originally, there was just hydrogen. Through a variety of reactions, hydrogen (the simplest element) produced all other elements on the periodic table in our solar system. (This makes me wonder: what do other solar systems look like, elementally? Did they experience the same reactions yielding the same elements, or an entirely different set?)4) the creator of the death gas used in WW2 concentration camps, Zyklon B (well, the first version anyway, named Zyklon A—it got slightly tweaked) was Franz Haber, a Jewish man famous for killing many Allied soldiers in painful chemical ways during WWI. Zyklon B was later used to murder thousands of people, including Haber’s own relatives5) Two elements called niobium and tantalum (named after Niobe and Tantalus from Greek myth) are found in the the Congo, combined in a rock called coltan. Niobium and tantalum are metals used in cell phones. The huge demand for coltan in the late 1990s/early 2000s caused anarchy and devastation in the Congo6) A scientist named Seaborg who worked on the Manhattan Project discovered the elements americium (which powers smoke detectors, by the way) and curium in 1946. Rather than announcing it in a scientific journal, Seaborg announced it on a children’s show, Quiz Kids (a child asked Seaborg if he’d discovered any new elements lately, and he explained that he had; judging by the mail he received from schoolchildren, teachers across the globe refused to believe the children’s claims the next week in school)7) the first antibacterial drug wasn’t penicillin (the first antibiotic)—in 1932, a man named Domagk discovered that Prontosil, an industrial dye, could be injected into a sick person to cure them of a bacterial infection (Domagk initially made this discovery on mice; when his daughter Hildegarde tripped while holding a sewing needle and acquired a life-threatening infection, Domagk gave it a whirl in humans, and she got better)8) Tellurium smells strongly of garlic. Beryllium tastes like sugar (despite being a toxic metal). Potassium tastes like salt!9) the European Union, appropriately, uses europium in the ink on euros to show they’re not counterfeit10) In the African nation of Gabon, there exists the only natural nuclear fission reactor known to exist, called Oklo—fueled by uranium, blue-green algae (pond scum), and plain water (the only reason there’s not a gigantic hole burned into Gabon? When the uranium reaches critical mass, it boils off the water, and without the water, the reaction stops). My favourite chapter was chapter 9 (on poisonous elements) because poison is cool. I was especially interested in how a local doctor (Noboru Hagino) discovered that cadmium was poisoning the people of Kamioka, Japan: with the help of a public health professor, he plotted the homes of all the people who came down with the mysterious disease (known as itai-itai, or “ouch ouch” disease), and was able to discover that they all lived along the Jinzu River, which carried cadmium, a waste product from the local mine. This reminded me a lot of The Ghost Map, which, as in the case of Kamioka, tells the story of how a local doctor and a public health professional teamed up to trace the root of a deadly disease (cholera, in that case) using mapping. (Speaking of London—I was also interested to see Alexander Litvinenko, murdered by polonium-spiked tea in a London sushi restaurant, get a mention; I recently saw his grave in Highgate Cemetery). Definitely a fun read if you have a spare afternoon and wish you knew the more fun side of chemistry."
448,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4053034-laura,1,"I didn't finish this book. I couldn't finish this book because the parts of this book that are about science I know could most generously be described as ""missleading at best"". If that's the case about the stuff I know, how much is true in the stuff I don't know? I'm called upon to teach some chemistry despite the fact my real chemistry knowledge pretty much ends at physical chemistry and astrochemistry - so I really don't need to fill my head with stories and theories that are pale reflections of the current state of knowledge when I don't read enough of the literature to judge how correct they are.I'm not sure where the author looked up the theory of solar system formation he gives in Chapter 4, but it wasn't in anything written in the last 20 years. If he'd turned in what's written here on an astronomy exam when I was in a generous mood I might give him a point or two for having a couple of right ideas in there, but he'd still have an F.I started to get a clue there was a problem when the author called the collision of comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 (1993 F2) with Jupiter ""intergalactic"". Huh? How is the collision of two solar system objects intergalactic? There's no evidence that SL9 was an extra-solar comet, much less an extra-galactic comet, but ok, he's using an odd hyperbole to make it sound more exciting. Overall the book has a very bubbly, casual style to it so I'll let him use this oddly chosen word. Things get worse however, when he implies Jupiter is the reason C/Hale-Bopp (1995 O1) came into the inner solar system. At this point I'm still assuming he knows that is not true and he's wording things really poorly, but I'm beginning to doubt I know enough of the science in other parts of the book to be able to see through this sort of thing elsewhere. However, it's when he writes ""Because the stellar wind blew only the lightest, most common elements as far out as Jupiter, it should have the same basic elemental composition as real stars"", that I pause and make a WTF!?! note in the margin. It takes me half a lecture or more to explain our current understanding of solar system formation, so I won't go through it all in this review, but the above is pure nonsense. More pure nonsense occurs when he mentions that the cloud of gas and dust our solar system formed out of was flat. There's no evidence for that and it's extremely unlikely dynamically. Simple physics flattens any shape of cloud collapsing under gravity to a spinning disk.Coming back to the missleading at best parts, we are told there are apparently mini-nuclear booms in stars counterbalancing gravity rather than thermal pressure. Booms implies a series of nuclear bombs going off when it is actually the steady rate of fusion in the interior of the Sun that causes the thermal pressure that balances gravity. Finally, given that I'm a planetary scientist, I just can't let slide the description of the Moon forming due to an ""asteroid or comet impact"". Well ok. If you want to call a roughly Mars sized planetesimal an asteroid or comet. However, there aren't any Mars sized planetesimals left that we'd call an asteroid or comet today. Mars is really in no danger of being demoted from planet-hood.I haven't picked on every problem with the astrophysics presented in this chapter, but all this and more brings me to the end of Chapter 4 with no trust the author knows anything about what he's talking about. This is likely not true given all the glowing reviews, one even appearing in the well respected journal Nature (I'm guessing a review by a chemist that knew no astronomy?). But having lost my trust it can't be regained, and I won't be finishing this book."
449,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9255064-melissa,4,"Chemistry has never been my thing. I hated it in high school (except for the part where we melted mechanical pencils over the Bunsen burner). Recently watching the chemistry Crash Course episodes has reminded me that chemistry is not just the boring science class I struggled to stay awake through in high school. Chemistry is everything around us and understanding a bit about it will help me better understand the way the world works.So I picked up The Disappearing Spoon with that in mind and was richly rewarded. Kean’s writing style was fun and made the subject matter interesting. He talks not only about the science behind each element, but about the scientists who discovered them and the impact they had on the world. For example Mendeleev, who is credited with creating the Periodic Table, had a fascinating start. He was born in Siberia, the youngest of 11 children. His father died when he was only 13 and his mother worked incredibly hard to give him the chance to go to school. Imagine having to overcome all of those things just to be able to go to school! Another favorite of mine was Marie Curie. Her fascinating life, including a marriage that was far ahead of its time and the discovery of multiple elements was so interesting. She won a Nobel Prize in a time when women in America weren’t even allowed to vote. I would love to a biography that focused solely on her.The periodic table has changed the world in both positive and negative ways. Kean doesn’t shy away from the damage that’s been done because of the discovery of a new element. He talks about the effects of vaccinations and medicines and also at the way chemistry made things like the atom bomb possible. When cell phones became wildly popular in the 1990s the fight to find more of the metal used to create them caused the Congo to explode with fighting. People were in a frenzy to provide the metal that was in such high demand. “Overall more than 5 million people have died in Congo since the mid-1990s, making it the biggest waste of life since World War II. The fighting there is proof that in addition to all the uplifting moments the Periodic table has inspired it can also play on humankind's worst, most inhumane instincts.”This balanced look at the Table reminds us that with great knowledge (just like great power) comes great responsibility. Almost any scientific advance can be used for good or bad and there will always be a struggle to use it correctly. BOTTOM LINE: The most interesting book I’ve read ever read about chemistry and one that kept me intrigued the entire time. We live in a truly remarkable world and I’ll never regret reading a book that opens up a new corner of that world to me."
450,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/981514-minli,4,"Entertaining read--and a fascinating subject matter. I'm definitely the right audience for this book: someone who knows some chemistry but didn't get any higher degrees in it, and is more interested in the historical, cultural building of the periodic table than the hard science.Kean's wry prose never lets you forget that his point of view is subjective and conversational: he paints caricatures of famous scientists and makes ridiculous analogies. His audience is undoubtedly American. He does his best to explain concepts (some of which I still remembered!) in layman's terms, though I kind of dozed off at the discussion of alpha. He does a good job giving awesome lady scientists their due, like Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin, Maria Groppert-Mayer and Marie Curie. I learned a bunch of things, how thallium is the worst ever poison (the poisoner's poison) and that cobalt-60 is the dirtiest and worst ever a-bomb. The structuring of the elements grouped into chapters, chapters grouped into parts, gave the book a flow and rhythm. It might have benefited from a longer conclusion.This book has made me feel like the biggest dork ever, because when people mention some element now, I have to squash the impulse to say, ""Hey! Did you know that...""The Disappearing Spoon also showed to me what my chemistry, biology and physics teachers in high school and college never did: how magical, weird, wonderful, temperamental, dangerous and dramatic science can be, how they're heterogeneously mixed with Romance and politics.

Beyond that, it's filled with interesting stories about the people who helped build the table and discover many of its elements, as well as other events that revolve around said elements. I particularly enjoyed the one about Germany's clandestine operations in the U.S. during WWI.One nitpick I had with this book: Every 2-3 pages, you'll find an asterisk that corresponds to a footnote in the back of the book. I'm the kind of person who simply cannot ignore these, and as a result, constantly going to the back of the book to read them made it a bit harder for me to immerse myself in the main text. Now, this is mainly the fault of my own brain, so I'm not subtracting anything from my score for it. Just be aware of this fact if you happen to be like me. Personally, I think the footnotes would have been less distracting if they were put on the actual page where they were referenced.Still, this book was really enjoyable. I look forward to digging into Kean's newer works when I've got some time."

I’m an admitted science geek. I loved the “Mr Wizard” TV show when I was a kid. (He encouraged us to perform all sorts of experiments using our mother’s kitchen utensils and supplies.) I never wanted a Barbie doll, I wanted a chemistry set and a microscope! So, I’ve had this book on my TBR list since it first came out. And I have to say that I’m a little disappointed.It’s not that Kean is a bad writer; he isn’t, and he’s quite thorough in exploring this topic. His enthusiasm and fascination for the periodic table comes through. But, it was just too much even for this science geek. Some parts were far more interesting to me than others. I loved the chapter on poisons, for example. I was less enthralled with the political infighting on what name to give to a newly discovered element. Also, I made the choice to listen to the audio format. Sean Runnette did a fine job of performing the audio. However, the sometimes dry subject matter made for a more difficult listening experience. I might have enjoyed this more in text."
453,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3349963-craig-cottingham,4,"I was a chemical engineering major in college, so some of the background information (like the basics of the periodic table) was familiar to me and therefore a little tedious to read. Outside of that, however, this was a fascinating book that I think would be accessible to non-beakerheads.Each chapter is devoted to a group of elements that are related. Instead of going for the obvious groupings (the inert gasses, the halogens, etc.) he comes at them from a refreshingly sideways direction. There's a chapter on poisons (from the obvious like arsenic, to thallium, which was responsible for thousands of deaths from contaminated groundwater in Japan) and another on measurements (from the international standard kilogram, which is an ingot of iridium, to the cesium-powered atomic clocks which define the international standard second). Each one reads a little like an episode of James Burke's TV series Connections, the way the discussion of one element blends into another. Sometimes the connections and the groupings are a little contrived, but not jarringly so, and I'm sure it was necessary to avoid a ""here are all the elements that didn't fit in anywhere else"" chapter.Highly recommended."
454,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"There’s a lot packed into this book. I enjoyed the look of the history of the periodic table; how it got started, the changes made over time, the discoveries of elements. Intermingled are the stories of the people; the scientists who figured things out and made things happen. Intertwined yet again are the stories of the theory and workings of atoms; what makes them tick, what makes them unique, what makes them react. Then there’s all those scientists; some humorous, some deceitful or crazy for fame. I really enjoyed the bit about the periodic table in the future and how the table if ever-changing and expanding. This is a wonderful book for those who enjoy chemistry, physics and anything “earthy”. "
455,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Fun romp through the periodic table - lots of chemistry and physics, but even more stories about science and the people who do it. Sam Kean has fun with history. The book is not very technical, but approachable and occasionally humorous. The stories are diverse - there are many elements on the table, so we jump around quite a bit. I enjoyed this on audio, found it both educational and entertaining, but I probably won’t remember much as there is no common storyline other than the stories being about elements."
456,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,2,"Uneven and only fitfully engaging, The Disappearing Spoon is less a history of the periodic table and how scientists have come to understand elemental matter than it is a collection of facts about those elements and anecdotes about the various researchers who've discovered them. Sam Kean doesn't really have the knack for explaining (or re-explaining) scientific concepts to people who haven't studied chemistry or physics since secondary school, and relies too much on clunky metaphors and irritating anthropomorphisms. (For example, Kean writes that stars are ""[d]esperate to maintain high temperatures."" Stars are not sentient. They do not have feelings. Even more jaw-droppingly asinine, though, are sentences like ""In addition to Haber's being a Jew, Germany excommunicated him because he had become passé."" Do I need to break down why this is, at an absolute minimum, a tacky way of putting things?) He never actually fully explains how the periodic table works.More damningly to me, as a historian, is that Kean tries to write from a perspective which is determinedly presentist. His interest in the past seems to primarily stem from wanting to know the backstory of the discovery and refinement of certain scientific concepts, rather than any desire to engage with the history of science as an evolving conceptual system which is inevitably shaped by those who practice it. For a man who seems fascinated by the universe on scales both macro and micro, Kean seems profoundly uninterested in the human."

Who needs gold? Give me molybdenum and tungsten.) and of course causing wars. A chapter that delves into lasers and masers (Holy shit, this was awesome! Seriously? How did I not know how lasers work? How did I learn all of the basic principles in physics, but I never learned how they come together in the most fantastic, brilliant way? I am happy to have rectified this situation.) and also the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a newish state of matter where a few thousand atoms becomes ""one giant marshmallow"" of an atom-a singularity and on a macro scale. This chapter ends with:""As technology keeps improving, scientists have gotten better and better at inducing matter to form the BEC. It's not like anyone's taking orders yet, but scientists might soon be able to build 'matter lasers' that shoot out ultra-focused beams of atoms thousands of times more powerful that light lasers, or construct 'supersolid' ice cubes that CAN FLOW THROUGH EACH OTHER WITHOUT LOSING THEIR SOLIDITY [emphasis mine]."" If I were a science teacher, the very next thing I would do after teaching this is have my students write a sci-fi story touching on where this technology is going next. What's it like to live in a world where solids can flow through each other? I know it's impossibly silly, but I immediately imagined humans that can walk through walls and stuff like that. Of course, this only happens at way below zero temperatures and on a very small scale. But you know, a girl can dream. There's also a chapter called ""Poisoner's Corridor: 'Ouch-Ouch'."" No need to elaborate. There's a chapter on elements as currency and of course fraud. There's even a section on how elements deceive our sense of taste-fascinating! (An example- chewing potassium gymnemate will make raw sugar heaped on your tongue taste like sand)Some other awesome tidbits:The person who discovered x-rays thought he went mad when he first saw the bones of his hands and a key hidden in a book. ""The primary component of taste, smell, is the only sense that bypasses our logical neural processing and connects directly to the brain's emotional centers.""""And whereas electrons absorb and emit light of the same color (yellow in, yellow out), fluorescent molecules absorb high-energy light (ultraviolet light) but emit that energy as lower-energy, visible light."" That's why we can see scorpions glow in the dark under black lights! This is what makes UV visible to us! The most powerful lasers today can produce beams that for a fraction of a second produce more power than the whole United States.Seriously, this book goes all over the place, but still manages to be organized. Loved it! "
458,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie,3,"""The Disappearing Spoon"" teaches the chemistry and physics of atoms and the periodic table. It's taught primarily in the context of short biographies about the Noble prize winning scientists (plus some others) who discovered the various elements or who discovered important things about how the elements or atoms are put together.Based on the book description I was given, I was expecting more trivia about the elements and how they are and have been used rather than a book teaching science with a main focus on scientists. However, the author's casual, lively, and sometimes crude tone made the stories entertaining--probably even more so to young males than to me. I did get a little tired of the author's judgmental attitude, though. It seemed like every human action had to be either brilliant or insanely stupid.The author's explanations of how things worked (atoms, periodic table, etc.) were easy for me to follow, but that might partly be because I took a lot of science courses in college. The initial science lessons were high school level, but the ending lessons were more college level (though high schoolers can probably follow them).The book primarily focused on science and scientists, but there were a few stories of invention, greed, destruction or just plain weirdness based around non-scientists. Though I didn't actually check to make sure, it seemed like every element on the periodic table was covered at least briefly. Some of the areas in which he discussed the use of the elements were warfare (chemical warfare, nuclear bombs, dirty bombs), medicine, politics, art, biology (especially DNA), as poison, as money (counterfeiting, a strange gold rush), and under super-cool conditions. He also covered a Big Bang model of how the elements were formed (with a ""see, no god needed!"" emphasis), how radiometric dating methods were thought up and used to generate dates for the age of the Earth that were old enough to give biological evolution a chance of occurring (since previous dating methods gave too ""young"" of an age to allow for it), and how biases can prevent critical viewing of scientific data (though he didn't seem to notice his own bias).He worked a lot of ""there is no God, humans & Earth aren't special, and evolution is true"" apologetics into this book. I wouldn't mind so much if, in the appendix, he hadn't presented what ""young-earth creationists believe"" by mixing true statements with misrepresented and apparently ridiculous ones as well as completely inaccurate ones. So now, if these readers come across the true argument, they'll dismiss it without really considering it--they'll think they know all about it when they don't.There were a few black and white photographs of scientists and a few charts. Overall, the book was entertaining and interesting, though not so much so that I'd want to read it again. The people who'd be most interested by it are probably teen or college age males who idolize science as pure and untarnished but who also like somewhat scandalous tales about scientists, their competitions to make Noble-winning discoveries, and their fights over who made a discovery first.I received this Advanced Reader Copy for review purposes from the publisher. "
459,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author relates many anecdotes of the discovery and uses of several elements with (as he says about those who know the periodic table) ""dweeby nonchalance.” It is meant to be a readable, interesting book of popular science for the lay reader, and indeed it is full of fascinating anecdotes about all things elemental. (The titular spoon is made of gallium, metal that melts in low temperatures and therefore a spoon made of it dissolves in tea. Ha ha, periodic table practical jokes!) Based on the title alone, I expected a lot of anecdotes such as the battle over the molybdenum mine in Colorado during WWII to help the Nazi war effort, or endless spats over naming rights of elements, but this book contains so much more. The madman Fritz Haber and his chlorine gas experiments; how the niobium in your cell phone helped finance the brutal Congo wars; an overview of the Bose-Einstein Condensate, the fifth state of matter; Henry Moseley’s electron beam; the alpha constant; why silicon-based life forms are extremely unlikely; Cobalt 60 dirty bombs; Monte Carlo science, itai-itai disease caused by Cadmium poisoning from mining companies on Japan; the role of gadolinium in MRI machines and cancer fighting; the left or right ""handedness"" of proteins; sulfur bacteria and how it relates to the sense of taste; the longest ""word"" ever, a technical term that is too long to be written; why we can unknowingly breathe in nitrogen without gasping for air until we suddenly collapse and die; why idolaters of Gandhi dislike iodine; how a lack of salt in a person suggests the nonexistence of the soul; how brass might be the nugget of truth behind the King Midas myth; how the science of bubbles led to the discovery of radon; and more. As you can see, the scope of this work is vast, possibly too much so. While it is written in a personable, conversational style, I felt that Kean doesn't manage to convey to the meanest scientific intelligence (namely me) a full understanding of the science he uses in the book, such as the aforementioned alpha constant, or how exactly electrons move from their ""shells."" Such information isn't necessary to appreciate the scientific history here, so for me it would have been better off cut entirely if impossible to simplify. I don't need the technical details to approve of a book that tells us that Lewis and Clark's route can be traced by the trace mercury in their feces, or refers to a Mark Twain story in which Satan is depicted as being made of radium, or that Paul McCartney was awarded a rhodium record (rather than gold or platinum) for his unsurpassed sales. That's the stuff that keeps the lay reader in their seats."
460,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Sam Kean has written a witty, interesting book about the elements in the Periodic Table. He writes as if he was chatting with the reader in a coffee shop or a tavern, regaling his friends with one anecdote after another. He's imparting his knowledge of science by the use of quirky, fun facts and interesting stories about the scientists involved.This is not set up like a typical chemistry textbook. The chapters are divided into areas of interest such as astronomy, poisons, money, war, medicine, and periods of history. The author is a physicist so the book had a lot of information about elements made in the lab, radioactive elements, nuclear chemistry, and the atomic bomb. For me, that was the most challenging part of the book.He writes about Linus Pauling's theory of a triple helix being trumped by James Watson and Francis Crick's double helix model of DNA. The attractive Marie Curie was a source of gossip when she took men into dark closets to show them radioactive specimens. Ghandhi told the people of India to dry their own salt instead of paying a British salt tax, only to have many people develop goiter due to lack of iodine. The trail taken by Lewis and Clark is known because anthropologists found (poisonous) mercury capsules that the explorers were using as laxatives. These types of stories make science seem more approachable.The title of the book comes from a practical joke. Gallium, which resembles aluminum, is a solid below 84 degrees F, and can be molded into a spoon. When it is dipped into hot tea, the surprised guest finds the spoon disappearing as it melts away. (Youtube has some ""disappearing spoon"" videos.)This is a book that can be enjoyed by the lay person as well as a scientist. Some chapters will be much easier to understand if a reader has had an introduction to the Periodic Table, such as in a high school Chemistry course. I would have preferred having the footnotes on the bottom of the pages rather than in the back of the book. Overall, the author should be commended for making science fun."
461,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3096541-amy,4,"I have to confess I didn't pay much attention to chemistry. Once the instructor talked about electrons, protons, atoms and the nucleus I usually turned on my Walkman (the cassette kind, now antique!). It never seemed interesting because it wasn't something that related at all to real life. If I had a teacher like Sam Kean, however, that could have been different.Fast forward too many years, and now I'm engrossed in this nonfiction 'memoir' of the Periodic Table of Elements. Like any good biography, this has scandal, lies, fraud, madness, explosions (!!!) and lots of name-dropping. Kean explains just what the periodic table is, but in a format that reads more like a novel, with anecdotal details to liven it up. Mercury pills were used by Lewis and Clark for their health? Yep, and you can trace their path (um, at least their bathroom trips on their journey) by where scientists have found unusually high amounts of mercury in the soil. The poet Robert Lowell? Did lithium ruin his work by making him sane? Who knew the lies and fraud and mind games played by scientists intent on getting a Nobel Prize! There's no getting around it, this is a book that makes you think. It's not simple and it assumes you have a basic knowledge of science. Some areas were over my head, but not for long. Kean is a wonderful teacher with a sassy wise guy voice that livens up any of the deeper areas."
462,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47354-dave,4,"For me this book was a pleasure to listen to. I plan to read a paper or e-book edition shortly. A delightful, an engaging blend of lyrical prose, historic anecdotes and fascinating information. Reminiscent, to me, of some of the writing of Lewis Thomas, Oliver Sacks, Barry Lopez, Edward Abbey and John McPhee.Brain/mind candy or chicken soup for the nerd's soul. Does that make me a dualist?The chapter essays are wide ranging anecdotal expositions of elements and families of elements. Not only stories about the scientists who prospected for and predicted the existence of certain elements, and created schemata for organizing them but about the influence of various elements on cultures, politics, economics and even philosophy. The stories added greatly to my appreciation for and understanding of the lives and work of some well known and some no longer famous scientists. The meditations on peculiar properties of some groups of atoms and alternative arrangements for the Periodic Table bumped my rating of the book from between 4 and 5 stars to clearly 5 stars. Others not so smitten on the history of science and mathematics may find it only mildly interesting or even boring. A must read for nerds, history buffs and fans of creative non-fiction. "
463,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2968341-linda-isakson,5,"I don't normally review non-fiction reads, but this one is just too superb to pass up! A wonderful and engaging read from cover-to-cover. Sam Kean takes the periodic table of the elements, a chart that makes most people cringe at thoughts of high school (or college) chemistry, and turns it into a riveting drama about the table's origins and the hunt to find new elements. Science geeks will love the scientific jargon but you don't need a degree in chemistry to understand the fascinating stories behind the revolutionaries responsible for our modern day technologies. This is definitely a book you can read over and over and still find little morsels you might have previously missed. Kean is amusing, insightful and presents complex information in a very understable package. A must read for fans of scientific history."
464,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18206572-inken,4,"I really enjoyed this book – even the parts I couldn’t understand. I so wish we’d had this as a set text when I took chemistry in high school. Not only might I have understood the rubbish our teacher was spouting, I might’ve liked it and even passed the bloody thing! Nobody ever even bothered to explain the Periodic Table to us and why it looks the way it does. And it's true: watching a gallium spoon dissolve in a glass of water is pretty cool.I had no idea the world of chemistry and physics was such a hotbed of rivalry, gossip and scandal. Delicious stuff."
465,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80835-celeste-ng,0,"Fascinating to me as the daughter of a chemist--I grew up with periodic tables all around, quite literally (I had a periodic table placemat!). Some of these stories were familiar to me, but most were new. Highly recommended for those who want to why the periodic table matters, and to know more about how the elements have changed human lives, sometimes drastically."
466,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40823165-yibbie,1," Never would I have assumed that I would have to quit reading a book about chemistry because of a lewd scene, but I did. In his attempt to introduce us to different chemicals and explain their lives, the author personifies them as characters in a smutty romance. So I quit what was up till then, an interesting book. "
467,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,5,"I’ve been reading a lot of non-fiction lately, and for me, that’s really...well, unusual. If you had asked me a couple of years ago how I felt about non-fiction, I would have described it as eye-glazingly dull, a dry recitation of facts. But now I eagerly scour the non-fiction shelves at the library. I know -- it’s crazy!The only explanation is that non-fiction has gotten better. (It can’t be me that’s changed.) The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean is a fine example of this better, more interesting non-fiction. Kean doesn’t skimp on the facts. He’s packed his book with oodles of information about the elements. What saves his book from being merely a mind-numbing collection of elemental characteristics may be gleaned from the book’s full title: The Disappearing Spoon and Other Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of Elements.Yes, it’s the madness and weirdness that brings the elements to life, and Kean seems to have dug up a fascinating story for virtually every element on the periodic table. For example, the title’s disappearing spoon refers to a (nerdy) practical joke in which unsuspecting victims are given a gallium spoon to stir their tea. I was particularly interested in the stories surrounding the radioactive elements, which ranged from an ex-KGB spy that was murdered with polonium-laced sushi in 2006 to a boy scout that tried to build his own nuclear reactor.Reading non-fiction like this is not only painless, but fun, and I’m convinced that I’m retaining all of those pesky little facts better that I normally would because I’ve so enjoyed learning them. Just wait until we meet at the next dinner party and I regale you with tales of elemental hijinks. If you’ve long despaired of enjoying non-fiction, perhaps now is the time to give it another try. "
468,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,4,"I pretty much knew I was going to like this book as soon as I heard about it. I mean, come on, it's about science! Some of the factoids I learned in this book will stick with me for a long time, like the naturally occurring nuclear reactor in Africa, or the reason why the Washington monument is capped with aluminum. At first I was disappointed that the book had end notes instead of footnotes. I do like footnotes. However, many of them were so long that I understood the reason for it. I ended up just having two bookmarks, one for where I was in the book, and one for where I was in the end notes.On one hand, there were sections that I feel I would have liked better if it hadn't been so long since my last chemistry class. On the other hand, if I were more well-versed in chemistry, some of the stories wouldn't have been so new and interesting to me.There were one or two slow sections in this book, but the interesting sections more than balanced it out. More to the point, this was a book that made me feel smarter for having read it--that goes a long way.One minor quibble that bothered me is that while there were two blank periodic tables which I found quickly, the actual periodic table in the book comes so close to the end that I wasn't able to find it, and I was looking for one. I would have liked to have one to reference. By the time I found it, I was almost done with the book and didn't need it as much. If the periodic table had been printed as an end paper, or in the beginning, or even at the start of the end notes where I could have found it, that would have made it easier to understand some of what the author talked about. After all, it's been a while since high school chemistry, and I only look at that chart periodically. (ha ha)"
469,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1951489-amanda,4,"Think back to your high school chemistry class. Chances are, the artwork adorning the classroom probably contained a poster with the periodic table of the elements. For some reason, all through 7 chemistry classes, my favorite was tungsten.Pop quiz - what is the chemical symbol for tungsten? Why, ""W"" of course! Why not T or Tu or Tg?? The ""W""is for wolfram, the German name for tungsten. Without it, those handy incandescent lightbulbs would not operate if it weren't for those tungsten filaments.I've always had a soft spot for science trivia, and the periodic table of the elements is full of interesting stories. If you have the same soft spot, I'd recommend ""The Disappearing Spoon"" by Sam Keane. The title references a property of the element gallium. Gallium turns from a solid to a liquid at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the author, a favorite prank of grad students is to fashion spoons made of gallium and to hand them out with tea or coffee. The spoon looks like the metal of other silverware, but when used in tea or coffee, melts away - a disappearing spoon!Another reason this is a great book is that it humanizes many of the famous scientists. In reading through textbooks, you never see into the personal lives or professional struggles of the discoveries and constants described in the text. Yet in The Disappearing Spoon, you see the races to get published (discovering and naming rights to elements), the discouragement at being passed up for a Nobel Prize yet again, and how wars and politics shape the or stunt technology."
470,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933518-jason,5,"Sometimes books just fall in my lap....Although I do pretty much put myself in a position where they seem to fall from the sky at a brisk rate. I went to Barnes & Noble the other day with the wife, ostensibly to get a cup of coffee, and picked up this book and Jose Saramago's 'The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'. I couldn't tell you what it was about it that caught my attention. I'm doing that thing again where I read too many books at once, but despite my inward pleas to the contrary, I couldn't resist picking it up and starting to read. What a great book. Refreshing, endlessly intriguing. Every page was a pleasure. Basically a book like this tells me two things: what a whiny spoiled brat I am, and what a complete dimwitted ape I am. In these pages I read about a woman who rode horseback for 1200 miles through a Russian winter to get her kid to a college only to see him rejected, and she then rode 400 more miles to get him to yet another school after which she promptly, and understandably, died. That's just so Russian. Then I read about a man who not only invented the Bunsen burner, he also invented the Spectrometer, and subsequently discovered several new elements, all in the 1850s. I look at myself and realize I'm liable to get suicidal if we run out of half and half, and my greatest achievement in life has been to arrange The Police's 'Roxanne' for the ukulele. Sometimes a good dose of perspective is extremely illuminating. "

Then The Disappearing Spoon might be the book for you.This book is exactly what it is made out to be. With a full title of The Disappearing Spoon And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, it tells you everything you should know. Kean starts with the periodic table, talks about how it was created, and from there, tells of fun, tragic, or interesting stories about all of the elements.Most of the science in The Disappearing Spoon is understandable with a high-school knowledge of chemistry. But even if you don't know enough chemistry, those parts can easily be skipped. Most of the book is heavily inspired by scientific history, rather than science itself. If you want to know more about the bickering and rivalries between chemists, this book is perfect. The Disappearing Spoon is highly entertaining, and it's clear the author has done extensive research into the lives of the scientists he talks about. My only gripe is that he has the tendency to lose direction sometimes, and flounders between all of the threads of stories he started, no longer clear on exactly what point he wanted to make. "

This is at times a ""cute book"" but in spite of it's promise it will help you if you have a deep abiding love of chemistry before you crack it open.It doesn't really appear to be organized all that well and isn't truly geared to the average reader. He opens up with his early fascination with mercury (the element, not the planet or the mythological deity) and how it led him into literature etc. Then he sets out to induce us all into the wonder/wonders that is/are the periodic table. I wasn't drawn into chemistry beyond what's required in high school, neither was I here. It didn't work, I lost interest quickly and wasn't interested in going on with the class.Enjoy if it's cup of tea...not mine. Maybe you'll like it, but I can't recommend it."
473,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"A fun read, for a certain value of fun. This is a book for science geeks, or those curious about science. If you're a full-fledged science geek, this could be a relatively light side read. If you're more of a layman, it's an opportunity to read some science that shouldn't be too far over your head, most of the time. I fall in the latter category. I wouldn't exactly call this a light read (though it's certainly easier going than some books that I've attempted) but the personable tone and fascinating stories kept me interested even when the going got a little tough. For a more science literate reader, those same stories would probably make it easier to get through the more familiar territory without getting bored. So yes, I did have fun, and I learned a few things, and I gave my brain a bit of a workout. Which is exactly what I like to see in a book about science."
474,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,3,"Since I have ditched my chemical engineering degree for a (once shiny) computer science one, whenever I see books like these I tend to gravitate towards them in pure nostalgia and consume them with a single minded passion. This book especially incited fond memories from my college days when we were consuming chemistry and its historical progress. I still have my periodic table poster that hung next to my bed for a good part of last decade. It was fun to read anecdotes, vignettes and author's own dealings with elements. The writing is casual, occasionally whimsical, terribly nostalgic and overall interesting. Though Kean refrains from overt use of technical jargon, it just isn't possible to escape it completely. With a dose of nostalgia, I enjoyed reading this."

It's full of exactly the kind of stories I like: scientists and other clever people finding out about the universe. This one is all about the Periodic Table of Elements, and stories about every single element. Some get star treatment, but even ultra-rare Francium gets a shout out. The science is good and the writer doesn't dumb things down too much. He also makes excellent use of foot notes which provide great asides as well as jumping off points for further reading. "
476,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999881-geoff,3,This book is filled with stories about the discoveries of the elements of the periodic table - some I knew and many I had never heard before. 
477,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"This is a relatively slim book, but it’s packed with super interesting stories you never learned in chemistry, like:1) Scientists tracked the path of Lewis & Clark across America by looking for mercury deposits. The party took mercury tablets to “cure” ailments, and wherever they went #2, they left mercury in the soil2) 7 different elements were discovered in Ytterby, a tiny suburban town in Sweden3) the elements in the periodic table haven’t always been around: originally, there was just hydrogen. Through a variety of reactions, hydrogen (the simplest element) produced all other elements on the periodic table in our solar system. (This makes me wonder: what do other solar systems look like, elementally? Did they experience the same reactions yielding the same elements, or an entirely different set?)4) the creator of the death gas used in WW2 concentration camps, Zyklon B (well, the first version anyway, named Zyklon A—it got slightly tweaked) was Franz Haber, a Jewish man famous for killing many Allied soldiers in painful chemical ways during WWI. Zyklon B was later used to murder thousands of people, including Haber’s own relatives5) Two elements called niobium and tantalum (named after Niobe and Tantalus from Greek myth) are found in the the Congo, combined in a rock called coltan. Niobium and tantalum are metals used in cell phones. The huge demand for coltan in the late 1990s/early 2000s caused anarchy and devastation in the Congo6) A scientist named Seaborg who worked on the Manhattan Project discovered the elements americium (which powers smoke detectors, by the way) and curium in 1946. Rather than announcing it in a scientific journal, Seaborg announced it on a children’s show, Quiz Kids (a child asked Seaborg if he’d discovered any new elements lately, and he explained that he had; judging by the mail he received from schoolchildren, teachers across the globe refused to believe the children’s claims the next week in school)7) the first antibacterial drug wasn’t penicillin (the first antibiotic)—in 1932, a man named Domagk discovered that Prontosil, an industrial dye, could be injected into a sick person to cure them of a bacterial infection (Domagk initially made this discovery on mice; when his daughter Hildegarde tripped while holding a sewing needle and acquired a life-threatening infection, Domagk gave it a whirl in humans, and she got better)8) Tellurium smells strongly of garlic. Beryllium tastes like sugar (despite being a toxic metal). Potassium tastes like salt!9) the European Union, appropriately, uses europium in the ink on euros to show they’re not counterfeit10) In the African nation of Gabon, there exists the only natural nuclear fission reactor known to exist, called Oklo—fueled by uranium, blue-green algae (pond scum), and plain water (the only reason there’s not a gigantic hole burned into Gabon? When the uranium reaches critical mass, it boils off the water, and without the water, the reaction stops). My favourite chapter was chapter 9 (on poisonous elements) because poison is cool. I was especially interested in how a local doctor (Noboru Hagino) discovered that cadmium was poisoning the people of Kamioka, Japan: with the help of a public health professor, he plotted the homes of all the people who came down with the mysterious disease (known as itai-itai, or “ouch ouch” disease), and was able to discover that they all lived along the Jinzu River, which carried cadmium, a waste product from the local mine. This reminded me a lot of The Ghost Map, which, as in the case of Kamioka, tells the story of how a local doctor and a public health professional teamed up to trace the root of a deadly disease (cholera, in that case) using mapping. (Speaking of London—I was also interested to see Alexander Litvinenko, murdered by polonium-spiked tea in a London sushi restaurant, get a mention; I recently saw his grave in Highgate Cemetery). Definitely a fun read if you have a spare afternoon and wish you knew the more fun side of chemistry."
478,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4053034-laura,1,"I didn't finish this book. I couldn't finish this book because the parts of this book that are about science I know could most generously be described as ""missleading at best"". If that's the case about the stuff I know, how much is true in the stuff I don't know? I'm called upon to teach some chemistry despite the fact my real chemistry knowledge pretty much ends at physical chemistry and astrochemistry - so I really don't need to fill my head with stories and theories that are pale reflections of the current state of knowledge when I don't read enough of the literature to judge how correct they are.I'm not sure where the author looked up the theory of solar system formation he gives in Chapter 4, but it wasn't in anything written in the last 20 years. If he'd turned in what's written here on an astronomy exam when I was in a generous mood I might give him a point or two for having a couple of right ideas in there, but he'd still have an F.I started to get a clue there was a problem when the author called the collision of comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 (1993 F2) with Jupiter ""intergalactic"". Huh? How is the collision of two solar system objects intergalactic? There's no evidence that SL9 was an extra-solar comet, much less an extra-galactic comet, but ok, he's using an odd hyperbole to make it sound more exciting. Overall the book has a very bubbly, casual style to it so I'll let him use this oddly chosen word. Things get worse however, when he implies Jupiter is the reason C/Hale-Bopp (1995 O1) came into the inner solar system. At this point I'm still assuming he knows that is not true and he's wording things really poorly, but I'm beginning to doubt I know enough of the science in other parts of the book to be able to see through this sort of thing elsewhere. However, it's when he writes ""Because the stellar wind blew only the lightest, most common elements as far out as Jupiter, it should have the same basic elemental composition as real stars"", that I pause and make a WTF!?! note in the margin. It takes me half a lecture or more to explain our current understanding of solar system formation, so I won't go through it all in this review, but the above is pure nonsense. More pure nonsense occurs when he mentions that the cloud of gas and dust our solar system formed out of was flat. There's no evidence for that and it's extremely unlikely dynamically. Simple physics flattens any shape of cloud collapsing under gravity to a spinning disk.Coming back to the missleading at best parts, we are told there are apparently mini-nuclear booms in stars counterbalancing gravity rather than thermal pressure. Booms implies a series of nuclear bombs going off when it is actually the steady rate of fusion in the interior of the Sun that causes the thermal pressure that balances gravity. Finally, given that I'm a planetary scientist, I just can't let slide the description of the Moon forming due to an ""asteroid or comet impact"". Well ok. If you want to call a roughly Mars sized planetesimal an asteroid or comet. However, there aren't any Mars sized planetesimals left that we'd call an asteroid or comet today. Mars is really in no danger of being demoted from planet-hood.I haven't picked on every problem with the astrophysics presented in this chapter, but all this and more brings me to the end of Chapter 4 with no trust the author knows anything about what he's talking about. This is likely not true given all the glowing reviews, one even appearing in the well respected journal Nature (I'm guessing a review by a chemist that knew no astronomy?). But having lost my trust it can't be regained, and I won't be finishing this book."
479,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9255064-melissa,4,"Chemistry has never been my thing. I hated it in high school (except for the part where we melted mechanical pencils over the Bunsen burner). Recently watching the chemistry Crash Course episodes has reminded me that chemistry is not just the boring science class I struggled to stay awake through in high school. Chemistry is everything around us and understanding a bit about it will help me better understand the way the world works.So I picked up The Disappearing Spoon with that in mind and was richly rewarded. Kean’s writing style was fun and made the subject matter interesting. He talks not only about the science behind each element, but about the scientists who discovered them and the impact they had on the world. For example Mendeleev, who is credited with creating the Periodic Table, had a fascinating start. He was born in Siberia, the youngest of 11 children. His father died when he was only 13 and his mother worked incredibly hard to give him the chance to go to school. Imagine having to overcome all of those things just to be able to go to school! Another favorite of mine was Marie Curie. Her fascinating life, including a marriage that was far ahead of its time and the discovery of multiple elements was so interesting. She won a Nobel Prize in a time when women in America weren’t even allowed to vote. I would love to a biography that focused solely on her.The periodic table has changed the world in both positive and negative ways. Kean doesn’t shy away from the damage that’s been done because of the discovery of a new element. He talks about the effects of vaccinations and medicines and also at the way chemistry made things like the atom bomb possible. When cell phones became wildly popular in the 1990s the fight to find more of the metal used to create them caused the Congo to explode with fighting. People were in a frenzy to provide the metal that was in such high demand. “Overall more than 5 million people have died in Congo since the mid-1990s, making it the biggest waste of life since World War II. The fighting there is proof that in addition to all the uplifting moments the Periodic table has inspired it can also play on humankind's worst, most inhumane instincts.”This balanced look at the Table reminds us that with great knowledge (just like great power) comes great responsibility. Almost any scientific advance can be used for good or bad and there will always be a struggle to use it correctly. BOTTOM LINE: The most interesting book I’ve read ever read about chemistry and one that kept me intrigued the entire time. We live in a truly remarkable world and I’ll never regret reading a book that opens up a new corner of that world to me."

I'm definitely the right audience for this book: someone who knows some chemistry but didn't get any higher degrees in it, and is more interested in the historical, cultural building of the periodic table than the hard science.Kean's wry prose never lets you forget that his point of view is subjective and conversational: he paints caricatures of famous scientists and makes ridiculous analogies. His audience is undoubtedly American. He does his best to explain concepts (some of which I still remembered!) in layman's terms, though I kind of dozed off at the discussion of alpha. He does a good job giving awesome lady scientists their due, like Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin, Maria Groppert-Mayer and Marie Curie. I learned a bunch of things, how thallium is the worst ever poison (the poisoner's poison) and that cobalt-60 is the dirtiest and worst ever a-bomb. The structuring of the elements grouped into chapters, chapters grouped into parts, gave the book a flow and rhythm. It might have benefited from a longer conclusion.This book has made me feel like the biggest dork ever, because when people mention some element now, I have to squash the impulse to say, ""Hey! Did you know that...""The Disappearing Spoon also showed to me what my chemistry, biology and physics teachers in high school and college never did: how magical, weird, wonderful, temperamental, dangerous and dramatic science can be, how they're heterogeneously mixed with Romance and politics. I wish I'd had this book in high school."
481,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19832185-thomas-frank,4,"As someone who never took chemistry, I found this book to provide just enough of the basics about the periodic table to enable me to sound at least a bit better than completely ignorant when talking about the subject. Beyond that, it's filled with interesting stories about the people who helped build the table and discover many of its elements, as well as other events that revolve around said elements. I particularly enjoyed the one about Germany's clandestine operations in the U.S. during WWI.One nitpick I had with this book: Every 2-3 pages, you'll find an asterisk that corresponds to a footnote in the back of the book. I'm the kind of person who simply cannot ignore these, and as a result, constantly going to the back of the book to read them made it a bit harder for me to immerse myself in the main text. Now, this is mainly the fault of my own brain, so I'm not subtracting anything from my score for it. Just be aware of this fact if you happen to be like me. Personally, I think the footnotes would have been less distracting if they were put on the actual page where they were referenced.Still, this book was really enjoyable. I look forward to digging into Kean's newer works when I've got some time."

Subtitle: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the ElementsWho could have imagined such a volume written about that chart that hangs in every high school chemistry classroom? I’m an admitted science geek. I loved the “Mr Wizard” TV show when I was a kid. (He encouraged us to perform all sorts of experiments using our mother’s kitchen utensils and supplies.) I never wanted a Barbie doll, I wanted a chemistry set and a microscope! So, I’ve had this book on my TBR list since it first came out. And I have to say that I’m a little disappointed.It’s not that Kean is a bad writer; he isn’t, and he’s quite thorough in exploring this topic. His enthusiasm and fascination for the periodic table comes through. But, it was just too much even for this science geek. Some parts were far more interesting to me than others. I loved the chapter on poisons, for example. I was less enthralled with the political infighting on what name to give to a newly discovered element. Also, I made the choice to listen to the audio format. Sean Runnette did a fine job of performing the audio. However, the sometimes dry subject matter made for a more difficult listening experience. I might have enjoyed this more in text."
483,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3349963-craig-cottingham,4,"I was a chemical engineering major in college, so some of the background information (like the basics of the periodic table) was familiar to me and therefore a little tedious to read. Outside of that, however, this was a fascinating book that I think would be accessible to non-beakerheads.Each chapter is devoted to a group of elements that are related. Instead of going for the obvious groupings (the inert gasses, the halogens, etc.) he comes at them from a refreshingly sideways direction. There's a chapter on poisons (from the obvious like arsenic, to thallium, which was responsible for thousands of deaths from contaminated groundwater in Japan) and another on measurements (from the international standard kilogram, which is an ingot of iridium, to the cesium-powered atomic clocks which define the international standard second). Each one reads a little like an episode of James Burke's TV series Connections, the way the discussion of one element blends into another. Sometimes the connections and the groupings are a little contrived, but not jarringly so, and I'm sure it was necessary to avoid a ""here are all the elements that didn't fit in anywhere else"" chapter.Highly recommended."
484,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"There’s a lot packed into this book. I enjoyed the look of the history of the periodic table; how it got started, the changes made over time, the discoveries of elements. Intermingled are the stories of the people; the scientists who figured things out and made things happen. Intertwined yet again are the stories of the theory and workings of atoms; what makes them tick, what makes them unique, what makes them react. Then there’s all those scientists; some humorous, some deceitful or crazy for fame. I really enjoyed the bit about the periodic table in the future and how the table if ever-changing and expanding. This is a wonderful book for those who enjoy chemistry, physics and anything “earthy”. "
485,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Fun romp through the periodic table - lots of chemistry and physics, but even more stories about science and the people who do it. Sam Kean has fun with history. The book is not very technical, but approachable and occasionally humorous. The stories are diverse - there are many elements on the table, so we jump around quite a bit. I enjoyed this on audio, found it both educational and entertaining, but I probably won’t remember much as there is no common storyline other than the stories being about elements."
486,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,2,"Uneven and only fitfully engaging, The Disappearing Spoon is less a history of the periodic table and how scientists have come to understand elemental matter than it is a collection of facts about those elements and anecdotes about the various researchers who've discovered them. Sam Kean doesn't really have the knack for explaining (or re-explaining) scientific concepts to people who haven't studied chemistry or physics since secondary school, and relies too much on clunky metaphors and irritating anthropomorphisms. (For example, Kean writes that stars are ""[d]esperate to maintain high temperatures."" Stars are not sentient. They do not have feelings. Even more jaw-droppingly asinine, though, are sentences like ""In addition to Haber's being a Jew, Germany excommunicated him because he had become passé."" Do I need to break down why this is, at an absolute minimum, a tacky way of putting things?) He never actually fully explains how the periodic table works.More damningly to me, as a historian, is that Kean tries to write from a perspective which is determinedly presentist. His interest in the past seems to primarily stem from wanting to know the backstory of the discovery and refinement of certain scientific concepts, rather than any desire to engage with the history of science as an evolving conceptual system which is inevitably shaped by those who practice it. For a man who seems fascinated by the universe on scales both macro and micro, Kean seems profoundly uninterested in the human."
487,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"What Neil DeGrasse Tyson does for astronomy and David Attenborough does for zoology, Sam Kean does for chemistry and physics TOGETHER. There were a few times when the author simplified technical explanations, which I think made it more confusing. For that reason, I almost gave this book a 4. However there were enough moments where my mind was completely blown that I decided it had to be a 5. The first chapter is boring, but it is well worth pushing through. (What is it with science and very boring first chapters. Always. Start with something that draws me in for cryin' out loud!) There is a fascinating chapter on elements in times of war (Gold? Who needs gold? Give me molybdenum and tungsten.) and of course causing wars. A chapter that delves into lasers and masers (Holy shit, this was awesome! Seriously? How did I not know how lasers work? How did I learn all of the basic principles in physics, but I never learned how they come together in the most fantastic, brilliant way? I am happy to have rectified this situation.) and also the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a newish state of matter where a few thousand atoms becomes ""one giant marshmallow"" of an atom-a singularity and on a macro scale. This chapter ends with:""As technology keeps improving, scientists have gotten better and better at inducing matter to form the BEC. It's not like anyone's taking orders yet, but scientists might soon be able to build 'matter lasers' that shoot out ultra-focused beams of atoms thousands of times more powerful that light lasers, or construct 'supersolid' ice cubes that CAN FLOW THROUGH EACH OTHER WITHOUT LOSING THEIR SOLIDITY [emphasis mine]."" If I were a science teacher, the very next thing I would do after teaching this is have my students write a sci-fi story touching on where this technology is going next. What's it like to live in a world where solids can flow through each other? I know it's impossibly silly, but I immediately imagined humans that can walk through walls and stuff like that. Of course, this only happens at way below zero temperatures and on a very small scale. But you know, a girl can dream. There's also a chapter called ""Poisoner's Corridor: 'Ouch-Ouch'."" No need to elaborate. There's a chapter on elements as currency and of course fraud. There's even a section on how elements deceive our sense of taste-fascinating! (An example- chewing potassium gymnemate will make raw sugar heaped on your tongue taste like sand)Some other awesome tidbits:The person who discovered x-rays thought he went mad when he first saw the bones of his hands and a key hidden in a book. ""The primary component of taste, smell, is the only sense that bypasses our logical neural processing and connects directly to the brain's emotional centers.""""And whereas electrons absorb and emit light of the same color (yellow in, yellow out), fluorescent molecules absorb high-energy light (ultraviolet light) but emit that energy as lower-energy, visible light."" That's why we can see scorpions glow in the dark under black lights! This is what makes UV visible to us! The most powerful lasers today can produce beams that for a fraction of a second produce more power than the whole United States.Seriously, this book goes all over the place, but still manages to be organized. Loved it! "
488,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie,3,"""The Disappearing Spoon"" teaches the chemistry and physics of atoms and the periodic table. It's taught primarily in the context of short biographies about the Noble prize winning scientists (plus some others) who discovered the various elements or who discovered important things about how the elements or atoms are put together.Based on the book description I was given, I was expecting more trivia about the elements and how they are and have been used rather than a book teaching science with a main focus on scientists. However, the author's casual, lively, and sometimes crude tone made the stories entertaining--probably even more so to young males than to me. I did get a little tired of the author's judgmental attitude, though. It seemed like every human action had to be either brilliant or insanely stupid.The author's explanations of how things worked (atoms, periodic table, etc.) were easy for me to follow, but that might partly be because I took a lot of science courses in college. The initial science lessons were high school level, but the ending lessons were more college level (though high schoolers can probably follow them).The book primarily focused on science and scientists, but there were a few stories of invention, greed, destruction or just plain weirdness based around non-scientists. Though I didn't actually check to make sure, it seemed like every element on the periodic table was covered at least briefly. Some of the areas in which he discussed the use of the elements were warfare (chemical warfare, nuclear bombs, dirty bombs), medicine, politics, art, biology (especially DNA), as poison, as money (counterfeiting, a strange gold rush), and under super-cool conditions. He also covered a Big Bang model of how the elements were formed (with a ""see, no god needed!"" emphasis), how radiometric dating methods were thought up and used to generate dates for the age of the Earth that were old enough to give biological evolution a chance of occurring (since previous dating methods gave too ""young"" of an age to allow for it), and how biases can prevent critical viewing of scientific data (though he didn't seem to notice his own bias).He worked a lot of ""there is no God, humans & Earth aren't special, and evolution is true"" apologetics into this book. I wouldn't mind so much if, in the appendix, he hadn't presented what ""young-earth creationists believe"" by mixing true statements with misrepresented and apparently ridiculous ones as well as completely inaccurate ones. So now, if these readers come across the true argument, they'll dismiss it without really considering it--they'll think they know all about it when they don't.There were a few black and white photographs of scientists and a few charts. Overall, the book was entertaining and interesting, though not so much so that I'd want to read it again. The people who'd be most interested by it are probably teen or college age males who idolize science as pure and untarnished but who also like somewhat scandalous tales about scientists, their competitions to make Noble-winning discoveries, and their fights over who made a discovery first.I received this Advanced Reader Copy for review purposes from the publisher. "
489,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author relates many anecdotes of the discovery and uses of several elements with (as he says about those who know the periodic table) ""dweeby nonchalance.” It is meant to be a readable, interesting book of popular science for the lay reader, and indeed it is full of fascinating anecdotes about all things elemental. (The titular spoon is made of gallium, metal that melts in low temperatures and therefore a spoon made of it dissolves in tea. Ha ha, periodic table practical jokes!) Based on the title alone, I expected a lot of anecdotes such as the battle over the molybdenum mine in Colorado during WWII to help the Nazi war effort, or endless spats over naming rights of elements, but this book contains so much more. The madman Fritz Haber and his chlorine gas experiments; how the niobium in your cell phone helped finance the brutal Congo wars; an overview of the Bose-Einstein Condensate, the fifth state of matter; Henry Moseley’s electron beam; the alpha constant; why silicon-based life forms are extremely unlikely; Cobalt 60 dirty bombs; Monte Carlo science, itai-itai disease caused by Cadmium poisoning from mining companies on Japan; the role of gadolinium in MRI machines and cancer fighting; the left or right ""handedness"" of proteins; sulfur bacteria and how it relates to the sense of taste; the longest ""word"" ever, a technical term that is too long to be written; why we can unknowingly breathe in nitrogen without gasping for air until we suddenly collapse and die; why idolaters of Gandhi dislike iodine; how a lack of salt in a person suggests the nonexistence of the soul; how brass might be the nugget of truth behind the King Midas myth; how the science of bubbles led to the discovery of radon; and more. As you can see, the scope of this work is vast, possibly too much so. While it is written in a personable, conversational style, I felt that Kean doesn't manage to convey to the meanest scientific intelligence (namely me) a full understanding of the science he uses in the book, such as the aforementioned alpha constant, or how exactly electrons move from their ""shells."" Such information isn't necessary to appreciate the scientific history here, so for me it would have been better off cut entirely if impossible to simplify. I don't need the technical details to approve of a book that tells us that Lewis and Clark's route can be traced by the trace mercury in their feces, or refers to a Mark Twain story in which Satan is depicted as being made of radium, or that Paul McCartney was awarded a rhodium record (rather than gold or platinum) for his unsurpassed sales. That's the stuff that keeps the lay reader in their seats."
490,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Sam Kean has written a witty, interesting book about the elements in the Periodic Table. He writes as if he was chatting with the reader in a coffee shop or a tavern, regaling his friends with one anecdote after another. He's imparting his knowledge of science by the use of quirky, fun facts and interesting stories about the scientists involved.This is not set up like a typical chemistry textbook. The chapters are divided into areas of interest such as astronomy, poisons, money, war, medicine, and periods of history. The author is a physicist so the book had a lot of information about elements made in the lab, radioactive elements, nuclear chemistry, and the atomic bomb. For me, that was the most challenging part of the book.He writes about Linus Pauling's theory of a triple helix being trumped by James Watson and Francis Crick's double helix model of DNA. The attractive Marie Curie was a source of gossip when she took men into dark closets to show them radioactive specimens. Ghandhi told the people of India to dry their own salt instead of paying a British salt tax, only to have many people develop goiter due to lack of iodine. The trail taken by Lewis and Clark is known because anthropologists found (poisonous) mercury capsules that the explorers were using as laxatives. These types of stories make science seem more approachable.The title of the book comes from a practical joke. Gallium, which resembles aluminum, is a solid below 84 degrees F, and can be molded into a spoon. When it is dipped into hot tea, the surprised guest finds the spoon disappearing as it melts away. (Youtube has some ""disappearing spoon"" videos.)This is a book that can be enjoyed by the lay person as well as a scientist. Some chapters will be much easier to understand if a reader has had an introduction to the Periodic Table, such as in a high school Chemistry course. I would have preferred having the footnotes on the bottom of the pages rather than in the back of the book. Overall, the author should be commended for making science fun."

Once the instructor talked about electrons, protons, atoms and the nucleus I usually turned on my Walkman (the cassette kind, now antique!). It never seemed interesting because it wasn't something that related at all to real life. If I had a teacher like Sam Kean, however, that could have been different.Fast forward too many years, and now I'm engrossed in this nonfiction 'memoir' of the Periodic Table of Elements. Like any good biography, this has scandal, lies, fraud, madness, explosions (!!!) and lots of name-dropping. Kean explains just what the periodic table is, but in a format that reads more like a novel, with anecdotal details to liven it up. Mercury pills were used by Lewis and Clark for their health? Yep, and you can trace their path (um, at least their bathroom trips on their journey) by where scientists have found unusually high amounts of mercury in the soil. The poet Robert Lowell? Did lithium ruin his work by making him sane? Who knew the lies and fraud and mind games played by scientists intent on getting a Nobel Prize! There's no getting around it, this is a book that makes you think. It's not simple and it assumes you have a basic knowledge of science. Some areas were over my head, but not for long. Kean is a wonderful teacher with a sassy wise guy voice that livens up any of the deeper areas."

A delightful, an engaging blend of lyrical prose, historic anecdotes and fascinating information. Reminiscent, to me, of some of the writing of Lewis Thomas, Oliver Sacks, Barry Lopez, Edward Abbey and John McPhee.Brain/mind candy or chicken soup for the nerd's soul. Does that make me a dualist?The chapter essays are wide ranging anecdotal expositions of elements and families of elements. Not only stories about the scientists who prospected for and predicted the existence of certain elements, and created schemata for organizing them but about the influence of various elements on cultures, politics, economics and even philosophy. The stories added greatly to my appreciation for and understanding of the lives and work of some well known and some no longer famous scientists. The meditations on peculiar properties of some groups of atoms and alternative arrangements for the Periodic Table bumped my rating of the book from between 4 and 5 stars to clearly 5 stars. Others not so smitten on the history of science and mathematics may find it only mildly interesting or even boring. A must read for nerds, history buffs and fans of creative non-fiction. "

A wonderful and engaging read from cover-to-cover. Sam Kean takes the periodic table of the elements, a chart that makes most people cringe at thoughts of high school (or college) chemistry, and turns it into a riveting drama about the table's origins and the hunt to find new elements. Science geeks will love the scientific jargon but you don't need a degree in chemistry to understand the fascinating stories behind the revolutionaries responsible for our modern day technologies. This is definitely a book you can read over and over and still find little morsels you might have previously missed. Kean is amusing, insightful and presents complex information in a very understable package. A must read for fans of scientific history."

I so wish we’d had this as a set text when I took chemistry in high school. Not only might I have understood the rubbish our teacher was spouting, I might’ve liked it and even passed the bloody thing! Nobody ever even bothered to explain the Periodic Table to us and why it looks the way it does. And it's true: watching a gallium spoon dissolve in a glass of water is pretty cool.I had no idea the world of chemistry and physics was such a hotbed of rivalry, gossip and scandal. Delicious stuff."

If you had asked me a couple of years ago how I felt about non-fiction, I would have described it as eye-glazingly dull, a dry recitation of facts. But now I eagerly scour the non-fiction shelves at the library. I know -- it’s crazy!The only explanation is that non-fiction has gotten better. (It can’t be me that’s changed.) The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean is a fine example of this better, more interesting non-fiction. Kean doesn’t skimp on the facts. He’s packed his book with oodles of information about the elements. What saves his book from being merely a mind-numbing collection of elemental characteristics may be gleaned from the book’s full title: The Disappearing Spoon and Other Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of Elements.Yes, it’s the madness and weirdness that brings the elements to life, and Kean seems to have dug up a fascinating story for virtually every element on the periodic table. For example, the title’s disappearing spoon refers to a (nerdy) practical joke in which unsuspecting victims are given a gallium spoon to stir their tea. I was particularly interested in the stories surrounding the radioactive elements, which ranged from an ex-KGB spy that was murdered with polonium-laced sushi in 2006 to a boy scout that tried to build his own nuclear reactor.Reading non-fiction like this is not only painless, but fun, and I’m convinced that I’m retaining all of those pesky little facts better that I normally would because I’ve so enjoyed learning them. Just wait until we meet at the next dinner party and I regale you with tales of elemental hijinks. If you’ve long despaired of enjoying non-fiction, perhaps now is the time to give it another try. "

Some of the factoids I learned in this book will stick with me for a long time, like the naturally occurring nuclear reactor in Africa, or the reason why the Washington monument is capped with aluminum. At first I was disappointed that the book had end notes instead of footnotes. I do like footnotes. However, many of them were so long that I understood the reason for it. I ended up just having two bookmarks, one for where I was in the book, and one for where I was in the end notes.On one hand, there were sections that I feel I would have liked better if it hadn't been so long since my last chemistry class. On the other hand, if I were more well-versed in chemistry, some of the stories wouldn't have been so new and interesting to me.There were one or two slow sections in this book, but the interesting sections more than balanced it out. More to the point, this was a book that made me feel smarter for having read it--that goes a long way.One minor quibble that bothered me is that while there were two blank periodic tables which I found quickly, the actual periodic table in the book comes so close to the end that I wasn't able to find it, and I was looking for one. I would have liked to have one to reference. By the time I found it, I was almost done with the book and didn't need it as much. If the periodic table had been printed as an end paper, or in the beginning, or even at the start of the end notes where I could have found it, that would have made it easier to understand some of what the author talked about. After all, it's been a while since high school chemistry, and I only look at that chart periodically. (ha ha)"

For some reason, all through 7 chemistry classes, my favorite was tungsten.Pop quiz - what is the chemical symbol for tungsten? Why, ""W"" of course! Why not T or Tu or Tg?? The ""W""is for wolfram, the German name for tungsten. Without it, those handy incandescent lightbulbs would not operate if it weren't for those tungsten filaments.I've always had a soft spot for science trivia, and the periodic table of the elements is full of interesting stories. If you have the same soft spot, I'd recommend ""The Disappearing Spoon"" by Sam Keane. The title references a property of the element gallium. Gallium turns from a solid to a liquid at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the author, a favorite prank of grad students is to fashion spoons made of gallium and to hand them out with tea or coffee. The spoon looks like the metal of other silverware, but when used in tea or coffee, melts away - a disappearing spoon!Another reason this is a great book is that it humanizes many of the famous scientists. In reading through textbooks, you never see into the personal lives or professional struggles of the discoveries and constants described in the text. Yet in The Disappearing Spoon, you see the races to get published (discovering and naming rights to elements), the discouragement at being passed up for a Nobel Prize yet again, and how wars and politics shape the or stunt technology."

I went to Barnes & Noble the other day with the wife, ostensibly to get a cup of coffee, and picked up this book and Jose Saramago's 'The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'. I couldn't tell you what it was about it that caught my attention. I'm doing that thing again where I read too many books at once, but despite my inward pleas to the contrary, I couldn't resist picking it up and starting to read. What a great book. Refreshing, endlessly intriguing. Every page was a pleasure. Basically a book like this tells me two things: what a whiny spoiled brat I am, and what a complete dimwitted ape I am. In these pages I read about a woman who rode horseback for 1200 miles through a Russian winter to get her kid to a college only to see him rejected, and she then rode 400 more miles to get him to yet another school after which she promptly, and understandably, died. That's just so Russian. Then I read about a man who not only invented the Bunsen burner, he also invented the Spectrometer, and subsequently discovered several new elements, all in the 1850s. I look at myself and realize I'm liable to get suicidal if we run out of half and half, and my greatest achievement in life has been to arrange The Police's 'Roxanne' for the ukulele. Sometimes a good dose of perspective is extremely illuminating. "

Then The Disappearing Spoon might be the book for you.This book is exactly what it is made out to be. With a full title of The Disappearing Spoon And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, it tells you everything you should know. Kean starts with the periodic table, talks about how it was created, and from there, tells of fun, tragic, or interesting stories about all of the elements.Most of the science in The Disappearing Spoon is understandable with a high-school knowledge of chemistry. But even if you don't know enough chemistry, those parts can easily be skipped. Most of the book is heavily inspired by scientific history, rather than science itself. If you want to know more about the bickering and rivalries between chemists, this book is perfect. The Disappearing Spoon is highly entertaining, and it's clear the author has done extensive research into the lives of the scientists he talks about. My only gripe is that he has the tendency to lose direction sometimes, and flounders between all of the threads of stories he started, no longer clear on exactly what point he wanted to make. "

This is at times a ""cute book"" but in spite of it's promise it will help you if you have a deep abiding love of chemistry before you crack it open.It doesn't really appear to be organized all that well and isn't truly geared to the average reader. He opens up with his early fascination with mercury (the element, not the planet or the mythological deity) and how it led him into literature etc. Then he sets out to induce us all into the wonder/wonders that is/are the periodic table. I wasn't drawn into chemistry beyond what's required in high school, neither was I here. It didn't work, I lost interest quickly and wasn't interested in going on with the class.Enjoy if it's cup of tea...not mine. Maybe you'll like it, but I can't recommend it."
503,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"A fun read, for a certain value of fun. This is a book for science geeks, or those curious about science. If you're a full-fledged science geek, this could be a relatively light side read. If you're more of a layman, it's an opportunity to read some science that shouldn't be too far over your head, most of the time. I fall in the latter category. I wouldn't exactly call this a light read (though it's certainly easier going than some books that I've attempted) but the personable tone and fascinating stories kept me interested even when the going got a little tough. For a more science literate reader, those same stories would probably make it easier to get through the more familiar territory without getting bored. So yes, I did have fun, and I learned a few things, and I gave my brain a bit of a workout. Which is exactly what I like to see in a book about science."
504,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,3,"Since I have ditched my chemical engineering degree for a (once shiny) computer science one, whenever I see books like these I tend to gravitate towards them in pure nostalgia and consume them with a single minded passion. This book especially incited fond memories from my college days when we were consuming chemistry and its historical progress. I still have my periodic table poster that hung next to my bed for a good part of last decade. It was fun to read anecdotes, vignettes and author's own dealings with elements. The writing is casual, occasionally whimsical, terribly nostalgic and overall interesting. Though Kean refrains from overt use of technical jargon, it just isn't possible to escape it completely. With a dose of nostalgia, I enjoyed reading this."
505,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5984690-sean-o,5,"One of the top non-fiction books I've read this year. It's full of exactly the kind of stories I like: scientists and other clever people finding out about the universe. This one is all about the Periodic Table of Elements, and stories about every single element. Some get star treatment, but even ultra-rare Francium gets a shout out. The science is good and the writer doesn't dumb things down too much. He also makes excellent use of foot notes which provide great asides as well as jumping off points for further reading. "
506,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999881-geoff,3,This book is filled with stories about the discoveries of the elements of the periodic table - some I knew and many I had never heard before. 
507,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"This is a relatively slim book, but it’s packed with super interesting stories you never learned in chemistry, like:1) Scientists tracked the path of Lewis & Clark across America by looking for mercury deposits. The party took mercury tablets to “cure” ailments, and wherever they went #2, they left mercury in the soil2) 7 different elements were discovered in Ytterby, a tiny suburban town in Sweden3) the elements in the periodic table haven’t always been around: originally, there was just hydrogen. Through a variety of reactions, hydrogen (the simplest element) produced all other elements on the periodic table in our solar system. (This makes me wonder: what do other solar systems look like, elementally? Did they experience the same reactions yielding the same elements, or an entirely different set?)4) the creator of the death gas used in WW2 concentration camps, Zyklon B (well, the first version anyway, named Zyklon A—it got slightly tweaked) was Franz Haber, a Jewish man famous for killing many Allied soldiers in painful chemical ways during WWI. Zyklon B was later used to murder thousands of people, including Haber’s own relatives5) Two elements called niobium and tantalum (named after Niobe and Tantalus from Greek myth) are found in the the Congo, combined in a rock called coltan. Niobium and tantalum are metals used in cell phones. The huge demand for coltan in the late 1990s/early 2000s caused anarchy and devastation in the Congo6) A scientist named Seaborg who worked on the Manhattan Project discovered the elements americium (which powers smoke detectors, by the way) and curium in 1946. Rather than announcing it in a scientific journal, Seaborg announced it on a children’s show, Quiz Kids (a child asked Seaborg if he’d discovered any new elements lately, and he explained that he had; judging by the mail he received from schoolchildren, teachers across the globe refused to believe the children’s claims the next week in school)7) the first antibacterial drug wasn’t penicillin (the first antibiotic)—in 1932, a man named Domagk discovered that Prontosil, an industrial dye, could be injected into a sick person to cure them of a bacterial infection (Domagk initially made this discovery on mice; when his daughter Hildegarde tripped while holding a sewing needle and acquired a life-threatening infection, Domagk gave it a whirl in humans, and she got better)8) Tellurium smells strongly of garlic. Beryllium tastes like sugar (despite being a toxic metal). Potassium tastes like salt!9) the European Union, appropriately, uses europium in the ink on euros to show they’re not counterfeit10) In the African nation of Gabon, there exists the only natural nuclear fission reactor known to exist, called Oklo—fueled by uranium, blue-green algae (pond scum), and plain water (the only reason there’s not a gigantic hole burned into Gabon? When the uranium reaches critical mass, it boils off the water, and without the water, the reaction stops). My favourite chapter was chapter 9 (on poisonous elements) because poison is cool. I was especially interested in how a local doctor (Noboru Hagino) discovered that cadmium was poisoning the people of Kamioka, Japan: with the help of a public health professor, he plotted the homes of all the people who came down with the mysterious disease (known as itai-itai, or “ouch ouch” disease), and was able to discover that they all lived along the Jinzu River, which carried cadmium, a waste product from the local mine. This reminded me a lot of The Ghost Map, which, as in the case of Kamioka, tells the story of how a local doctor and a public health professional teamed up to trace the root of a deadly disease (cholera, in that case) using mapping. (Speaking of London—I was also interested to see Alexander Litvinenko, murdered by polonium-spiked tea in a London sushi restaurant, get a mention; I recently saw his grave in Highgate Cemetery). Definitely a fun read if you have a spare afternoon and wish you knew the more fun side of chemistry."
508,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4053034-laura,1,"I didn't finish this book. I couldn't finish this book because the parts of this book that are about science I know could most generously be described as ""missleading at best"". If that's the case about the stuff I know, how much is true in the stuff I don't know? I'm called upon to teach some chemistry despite the fact my real chemistry knowledge pretty much ends at physical chemistry and astrochemistry - so I really don't need to fill my head with stories and theories that are pale reflections of the current state of knowledge when I don't read enough of the literature to judge how correct they are.I'm not sure where the author looked up the theory of solar system formation he gives in Chapter 4, but it wasn't in anything written in the last 20 years. If he'd turned in what's written here on an astronomy exam when I was in a generous mood I might give him a point or two for having a couple of right ideas in there, but he'd still have an F.I started to get a clue there was a problem when the author called the collision of comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 (1993 F2) with Jupiter ""intergalactic"". Huh? How is the collision of two solar system objects intergalactic? There's no evidence that SL9 was an extra-solar comet, much less an extra-galactic comet, but ok, he's using an odd hyperbole to make it sound more exciting. Overall the book has a very bubbly, casual style to it so I'll let him use this oddly chosen word. Things get worse however, when he implies Jupiter is the reason C/Hale-Bopp (1995 O1) came into the inner solar system. At this point I'm still assuming he knows that is not true and he's wording things really poorly, but I'm beginning to doubt I know enough of the science in other parts of the book to be able to see through this sort of thing elsewhere. However, it's when he writes ""Because the stellar wind blew only the lightest, most common elements as far out as Jupiter, it should have the same basic elemental composition as real stars"", that I pause and make a WTF!?! note in the margin. It takes me half a lecture or more to explain our current understanding of solar system formation, so I won't go through it all in this review, but the above is pure nonsense. More pure nonsense occurs when he mentions that the cloud of gas and dust our solar system formed out of was flat. There's no evidence for that and it's extremely unlikely dynamically. Simple physics flattens any shape of cloud collapsing under gravity to a spinning disk.Coming back to the missleading at best parts, we are told there are apparently mini-nuclear booms in stars counterbalancing gravity rather than thermal pressure. Booms implies a series of nuclear bombs going off when it is actually the steady rate of fusion in the interior of the Sun that causes the thermal pressure that balances gravity. Finally, given that I'm a planetary scientist, I just can't let slide the description of the Moon forming due to an ""asteroid or comet impact"". Well ok. If you want to call a roughly Mars sized planetesimal an asteroid or comet. However, there aren't any Mars sized planetesimals left that we'd call an asteroid or comet today. Mars is really in no danger of being demoted from planet-hood.I haven't picked on every problem with the astrophysics presented in this chapter, but all this and more brings me to the end of Chapter 4 with no trust the author knows anything about what he's talking about. This is likely not true given all the glowing reviews, one even appearing in the well respected journal Nature (I'm guessing a review by a chemist that knew no astronomy?). But having lost my trust it can't be regained, and I won't be finishing this book."
509,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9255064-melissa,4,"Chemistry has never been my thing. I hated it in high school (except for the part where we melted mechanical pencils over the Bunsen burner). Recently watching the chemistry Crash Course episodes has reminded me that chemistry is not just the boring science class I struggled to stay awake through in high school. Chemistry is everything around us and understanding a bit about it will help me better understand the way the world works.So I picked up The Disappearing Spoon with that in mind and was richly rewarded. Kean’s writing style was fun and made the subject matter interesting. He talks not only about the science behind each element, but about the scientists who discovered them and the impact they had on the world. For example Mendeleev, who is credited with creating the Periodic Table, had a fascinating start. He was born in Siberia, the youngest of 11 children. His father died when he was only 13 and his mother worked incredibly hard to give him the chance to go to school. Imagine having to overcome all of those things just to be able to go to school! Another favorite of mine was Marie Curie. Her fascinating life, including a marriage that was far ahead of its time and the discovery of multiple elements was so interesting. She won a Nobel Prize in a time when women in America weren’t even allowed to vote. I would love to a biography that focused solely on her.The periodic table has changed the world in both positive and negative ways. Kean doesn’t shy away from the damage that’s been done because of the discovery of a new element. He talks about the effects of vaccinations and medicines and also at the way chemistry made things like the atom bomb possible. When cell phones became wildly popular in the 1990s the fight to find more of the metal used to create them caused the Congo to explode with fighting. People were in a frenzy to provide the metal that was in such high demand. “Overall more than 5 million people have died in Congo since the mid-1990s, making it the biggest waste of life since World War II. The fighting there is proof that in addition to all the uplifting moments the Periodic table has inspired it can also play on humankind's worst, most inhumane instincts.”This balanced look at the Table reminds us that with great knowledge (just like great power) comes great responsibility. Almost any scientific advance can be used for good or bad and there will always be a struggle to use it correctly. BOTTOM LINE: The most interesting book I’ve read ever read about chemistry and one that kept me intrigued the entire time. We live in a truly remarkable world and I’ll never regret reading a book that opens up a new corner of that world to me."
510,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/981514-minli,4,"Entertaining read--and a fascinating subject matter. I'm definitely the right audience for this book: someone who knows some chemistry but didn't get any higher degrees in it, and is more interested in the historical, cultural building of the periodic table than the hard science.Kean's wry prose never lets you forget that his point of view is subjective and conversational: he paints caricatures of famous scientists and makes ridiculous analogies. His audience is undoubtedly American. He does his best to explain concepts (some of which I still remembered!) in layman's terms, though I kind of dozed off at the discussion of alpha. He does a good job giving awesome lady scientists their due, like Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin, Maria Groppert-Mayer and Marie Curie. I learned a bunch of things, how thallium is the worst ever poison (the poisoner's poison) and that cobalt-60 is the dirtiest and worst ever a-bomb. The structuring of the elements grouped into chapters, chapters grouped into parts, gave the book a flow and rhythm. It might have benefited from a longer conclusion.This book has made me feel like the biggest dork ever, because when people mention some element now, I have to squash the impulse to say, ""Hey! Did you know that...""The Disappearing Spoon also showed to me what my chemistry, biology and physics teachers in high school and college never did: how magical, weird, wonderful, temperamental, dangerous and dramatic science can be, how they're heterogeneously mixed with Romance and politics. I wish I'd had this book in high school."
511,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19832185-thomas-frank,4,"As someone who never took chemistry, I found this book to provide just enough of the basics about the periodic table to enable me to sound at least a bit better than completely ignorant when talking about the subject. Beyond that, it's filled with interesting stories about the people who helped build the table and discover many of its elements, as well as other events that revolve around said elements. I particularly enjoyed the one about Germany's clandestine operations in the U.S. during WWI.One nitpick I had with this book: Every 2-3 pages, you'll find an asterisk that corresponds to a footnote in the back of the book. I'm the kind of person who simply cannot ignore these, and as a result, constantly going to the back of the book to read them made it a bit harder for me to immerse myself in the main text. Now, this is mainly the fault of my own brain, so I'm not subtracting anything from my score for it. Just be aware of this fact if you happen to be like me. Personally, I think the footnotes would have been less distracting if they were put on the actual page where they were referenced.Still, this book was really enjoyable. I look forward to digging into Kean's newer works when I've got some time."

Subtitle: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the ElementsWho could have imagined such a volume written about that chart that hangs in every high school chemistry classroom? I’m an admitted science geek. I loved the “Mr Wizard” TV show when I was a kid. (He encouraged us to perform all sorts of experiments using our mother’s kitchen utensils and supplies.) I never wanted a Barbie doll, I wanted a chemistry set and a microscope! So, I’ve had this book on my TBR list since it first came out. And I have to say that I’m a little disappointed.It’s not that Kean is a bad writer; he isn’t, and he’s quite thorough in exploring this topic. His enthusiasm and fascination for the periodic table comes through. But, it was just too much even for this science geek. Some parts were far more interesting to me than others. I loved the chapter on poisons, for example. I was less enthralled with the political infighting on what name to give to a newly discovered element. Also, I made the choice to listen to the audio format. Sean Runnette did a fine job of performing the audio. However, the sometimes dry subject matter made for a more difficult listening experience. I might have enjoyed this more in text."
513,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3349963-craig-cottingham,4,"I was a chemical engineering major in college, so some of the background information (like the basics of the periodic table) was familiar to me and therefore a little tedious to read. Outside of that, however, this was a fascinating book that I think would be accessible to non-beakerheads.Each chapter is devoted to a group of elements that are related. Instead of going for the obvious groupings (the inert gasses, the halogens, etc.) he comes at them from a refreshingly sideways direction. There's a chapter on poisons (from the obvious like arsenic, to thallium, which was responsible for thousands of deaths from contaminated groundwater in Japan) and another on measurements (from the international standard kilogram, which is an ingot of iridium, to the cesium-powered atomic clocks which define the international standard second). Each one reads a little like an episode of James Burke's TV series Connections, the way the discussion of one element blends into another. Sometimes the connections and the groupings are a little contrived, but not jarringly so, and I'm sure it was necessary to avoid a ""here are all the elements that didn't fit in anywhere else"" chapter.Highly recommended."
514,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"There’s a lot packed into this book. I enjoyed the look of the history of the periodic table; how it got started, the changes made over time, the discoveries of elements. Intermingled are the stories of the people; the scientists who figured things out and made things happen. Intertwined yet again are the stories of the theory and workings of atoms; what makes them tick, what makes them unique, what makes them react. Then there’s all those scientists; some humorous, some deceitful or crazy for fame. I really enjoyed the bit about the periodic table in the future and how the table if ever-changing and expanding. This is a wonderful book for those who enjoy chemistry, physics and anything “earthy”. "
515,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Fun romp through the periodic table - lots of chemistry and physics, but even more stories about science and the people who do it. Sam Kean has fun with history. The book is not very technical, but approachable and occasionally humorous. The stories are diverse - there are many elements on the table, so we jump around quite a bit. I enjoyed this on audio, found it both educational and entertaining, but I probably won’t remember much as there is no common storyline other than the stories being about elements."
516,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,2,"Uneven and only fitfully engaging, The Disappearing Spoon is less a history of the periodic table and how scientists have come to understand elemental matter than it is a collection of facts about those elements and anecdotes about the various researchers who've discovered them. Sam Kean doesn't really have the knack for explaining (or re-explaining) scientific concepts to people who haven't studied chemistry or physics since secondary school, and relies too much on clunky metaphors and irritating anthropomorphisms. (For example, Kean writes that stars are ""[d]esperate to maintain high temperatures."" Stars are not sentient. They do not have feelings. Even more jaw-droppingly asinine, though, are sentences like ""In addition to Haber's being a Jew, Germany excommunicated him because he had become passé."" Do I need to break down why this is, at an absolute minimum, a tacky way of putting things?) He never actually fully explains how the periodic table works.More damningly to me, as a historian, is that Kean tries to write from a perspective which is determinedly presentist. His interest in the past seems to primarily stem from wanting to know the backstory of the discovery and refinement of certain scientific concepts, rather than any desire to engage with the history of science as an evolving conceptual system which is inevitably shaped by those who practice it. For a man who seems fascinated by the universe on scales both macro and micro, Kean seems profoundly uninterested in the human."

There were a few times when the author simplified technical explanations, which I think made it more confusing. For that reason, I almost gave this book a 4. However there were enough moments where my mind was completely blown that I decided it had to be a 5. The first chapter is boring, but it is well worth pushing through. (What is it with science and very boring first chapters. Always. Start with something that draws me in for cryin' out loud!) There is a fascinating chapter on elements in times of war (Gold? Who needs gold? Give me molybdenum and tungsten.) and of course causing wars. A chapter that delves into lasers and masers (Holy shit, this was awesome! Seriously? How did I not know how lasers work? How did I learn all of the basic principles in physics, but I never learned how they come together in the most fantastic, brilliant way? I am happy to have rectified this situation.) and also the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a newish state of matter where a few thousand atoms becomes ""one giant marshmallow"" of an atom-a singularity and on a macro scale. This chapter ends with:""As technology keeps improving, scientists have gotten better and better at inducing matter to form the BEC. It's not like anyone's taking orders yet, but scientists might soon be able to build 'matter lasers' that shoot out ultra-focused beams of atoms thousands of times more powerful that light lasers, or construct 'supersolid' ice cubes that CAN FLOW THROUGH EACH OTHER WITHOUT LOSING THEIR SOLIDITY [emphasis mine]."" If I were a science teacher, the very next thing I would do after teaching this is have my students write a sci-fi story touching on where this technology is going next. What's it like to live in a world where solids can flow through each other? I know it's impossibly silly, but I immediately imagined humans that can walk through walls and stuff like that. Of course, this only happens at way below zero temperatures and on a very small scale. But you know, a girl can dream. There's also a chapter called ""Poisoner's Corridor: 'Ouch-Ouch'."" No need to elaborate. There's a chapter on elements as currency and of course fraud. There's even a section on how elements deceive our sense of taste-fascinating! (An example- chewing potassium gymnemate will make raw sugar heaped on your tongue taste like sand)Some other awesome tidbits:The person who discovered x-rays thought he went mad when he first saw the bones of his hands and a key hidden in a book. ""The primary component of taste, smell, is the only sense that bypasses our logical neural processing and connects directly to the brain's emotional centers.""""And whereas electrons absorb and emit light of the same color (yellow in, yellow out), fluorescent molecules absorb high-energy light (ultraviolet light) but emit that energy as lower-energy, visible light."" That's why we can see scorpions glow in the dark under black lights! This is what makes UV visible to us! The most powerful lasers today can produce beams that for a fraction of a second produce more power than the whole United States.Seriously, this book goes all over the place, but still manages to be organized. Loved it! "
518,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie,3,"""The Disappearing Spoon"" teaches the chemistry and physics of atoms and the periodic table. It's taught primarily in the context of short biographies about the Noble prize winning scientists (plus some others) who discovered the various elements or who discovered important things about how the elements or atoms are put together.Based on the book description I was given, I was expecting more trivia about the elements and how they are and have been used rather than a book teaching science with a main focus on scientists. However, the author's casual, lively, and sometimes crude tone made the stories entertaining--probably even more so to young males than to me. I did get a little tired of the author's judgmental attitude, though. It seemed like every human action had to be either brilliant or insanely stupid.The author's explanations of how things worked (atoms, periodic table, etc.) were easy for me to follow, but that might partly be because I took a lot of science courses in college. The initial science lessons were high school level, but the ending lessons were more college level (though high schoolers can probably follow them).The book primarily focused on science and scientists, but there were a few stories of invention, greed, destruction or just plain weirdness based around non-scientists. Though I didn't actually check to make sure, it seemed like every element on the periodic table was covered at least briefly. Some of the areas in which he discussed the use of the elements were warfare (chemical warfare, nuclear bombs, dirty bombs), medicine, politics, art, biology (especially DNA), as poison, as money (counterfeiting, a strange gold rush), and under super-cool conditions. He also covered a Big Bang model of how the elements were formed (with a ""see, no god needed!"" emphasis), how radiometric dating methods were thought up and used to generate dates for the age of the Earth that were old enough to give biological evolution a chance of occurring (since previous dating methods gave too ""young"" of an age to allow for it), and how biases can prevent critical viewing of scientific data (though he didn't seem to notice his own bias).He worked a lot of ""there is no God, humans & Earth aren't special, and evolution is true"" apologetics into this book. I wouldn't mind so much if, in the appendix, he hadn't presented what ""young-earth creationists believe"" by mixing true statements with misrepresented and apparently ridiculous ones as well as completely inaccurate ones. So now, if these readers come across the true argument, they'll dismiss it without really considering it--they'll think they know all about it when they don't.There were a few black and white photographs of scientists and a few charts. Overall, the book was entertaining and interesting, though not so much so that I'd want to read it again. The people who'd be most interested by it are probably teen or college age males who idolize science as pure and untarnished but who also like somewhat scandalous tales about scientists, their competitions to make Noble-winning discoveries, and their fights over who made a discovery first.I received this Advanced Reader Copy for review purposes from the publisher.

519,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author relates many anecdotes of the discovery and uses of several elements with (as he says about those who know the periodic table) ""dweeby nonchalance.” It is meant to be a readable, interesting book of popular science for the lay reader, and indeed it is full of fascinating anecdotes about all things elemental. (The titular spoon is made of gallium, metal that melts in low temperatures and therefore a spoon made of it dissolves in tea. Ha ha, periodic table practical jokes!) Based on the title alone, I expected a lot of anecdotes such as the battle over the molybdenum mine in Colorado during WWII to help the Nazi war effort, or endless spats over naming rights of elements, but this book contains so much more. The madman Fritz Haber and his chlorine gas experiments; how the niobium in your cell phone helped finance the brutal Congo wars; an overview of the Bose-Einstein Condensate, the fifth state of matter; Henry Moseley’s electron beam; the alpha constant; why silicon-based life forms are extremely unlikely; Cobalt 60 dirty bombs; Monte Carlo science, itai-itai disease caused by Cadmium poisoning from mining companies on Japan; the role of gadolinium in MRI machines and cancer fighting; the left or right ""handedness"" of proteins; sulfur bacteria and how it relates to the sense of taste; the longest ""word"" ever, a technical term that is too long to be written; why we can unknowingly breathe in nitrogen without gasping for air until we suddenly collapse and die; why idolaters of Gandhi dislike iodine; how a lack of salt in a person suggests the nonexistence of the soul; how brass might be the nugget of truth behind the King Midas myth; how the science of bubbles led to the discovery of radon; and more. As you can see, the scope of this work is vast, possibly too much so. While it is written in a personable, conversational style, I felt that Kean doesn't manage to convey to the meanest scientific intelligence (namely me) a full understanding of the science he uses in the book, such as the aforementioned alpha constant, or how exactly electrons move from their ""shells."" Such information isn't necessary to appreciate the scientific history here, so for me it would have been better off cut entirely if impossible to simplify. I don't need the technical details to approve of a book that tells us that Lewis and Clark's route can be traced by the trace mercury in their feces, or refers to a Mark Twain story in which Satan is depicted as being made of radium, or that Paul McCartney was awarded a rhodium record (rather than gold or platinum) for his unsurpassed sales. That's the stuff that keeps the lay reader in their seats."
520,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Sam Kean has written a witty, interesting book about the elements in the Periodic Table. He writes as if he was chatting with the reader in a coffee shop or a tavern, regaling his friends with one anecdote after another. He's imparting his knowledge of science by the use of quirky, fun facts and interesting stories about the scientists involved.This is not set up like a typical chemistry textbook. The chapters are divided into areas of interest such as astronomy, poisons, money, war, medicine, and periods of history. The author is a physicist so the book had a lot of information about elements made in the lab, radioactive elements, nuclear chemistry, and the atomic bomb. For me, that was the most challenging part of the book.He writes about Linus Pauling's theory of a triple helix being trumped by James Watson and Francis Crick's double helix model of DNA. The attractive Marie Curie was a source of gossip when she took men into dark closets to show them radioactive specimens. Ghandhi told the people of India to dry their own salt instead of paying a British salt tax, only to have many people develop goiter due to lack of iodine. The trail taken by Lewis and Clark is known because anthropologists found (poisonous) mercury capsules that the explorers were using as laxatives. These types of stories make science seem more approachable.The title of the book comes from a practical joke. Gallium, which resembles aluminum, is a solid below 84 degrees F, and can be molded into a spoon. When it is dipped into hot tea, the surprised guest finds the spoon disappearing as it melts away. (Youtube has some ""disappearing spoon"" videos.)This is a book that can be enjoyed by the lay person as well as a scientist. Some chapters will be much easier to understand if a reader has had an introduction to the Periodic Table, such as in a high school Chemistry course. I would have preferred having the footnotes on the bottom of the pages rather than in the back of the book. Overall, the author should be commended for making science fun."
521,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3096541-amy,4,"I have to confess I didn't pay much attention to chemistry. Once the instructor talked about electrons, protons, atoms and the nucleus I usually turned on my Walkman (the cassette kind, now antique!). It never seemed interesting because it wasn't something that related at all to real life. If I had a teacher like Sam Kean, however, that could have been different.Fast forward too many years, and now I'm engrossed in this nonfiction 'memoir' of the Periodic Table of Elements. Like any good biography, this has scandal, lies, fraud, madness, explosions (!!!) and lots of name-dropping. Kean explains just what the periodic table is, but in a format that reads more like a novel, with anecdotal details to liven it up. Mercury pills were used by Lewis and Clark for their health? Yep, and you can trace their path (um, at least their bathroom trips on their journey) by where scientists have found unusually high amounts of mercury in the soil. The poet Robert Lowell? Did lithium ruin his work by making him sane? Who knew the lies and fraud and mind games played by scientists intent on getting a Nobel Prize! There's no getting around it, this is a book that makes you think. It's not simple and it assumes you have a basic knowledge of science. Some areas were over my head, but not for long. Kean is a wonderful teacher with a sassy wise guy voice that livens up any of the deeper areas."
522,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47354-dave,4,"For me this book was a pleasure to listen to. I plan to read a paper or e-book edition shortly. A delightful, an engaging blend of lyrical prose, historic anecdotes and fascinating information. Reminiscent, to me, of some of the writing of Lewis Thomas, Oliver Sacks, Barry Lopez, Edward Abbey and John McPhee.Brain/mind candy or chicken soup for the nerd's soul. Does that make me a dualist?The chapter essays are wide ranging anecdotal expositions of elements and families of elements. Not only stories about the scientists who prospected for and predicted the existence of certain elements, and created schemata for organizing them but about the influence of various elements on cultures, politics, economics and even philosophy. The stories added greatly to my appreciation for and understanding of the lives and work of some well known and some no longer famous scientists. The meditations on peculiar properties of some groups of atoms and alternative arrangements for the Periodic Table bumped my rating of the book from between 4 and 5 stars to clearly 5 stars. Others not so smitten on the history of science and mathematics may find it only mildly interesting or even boring. A must read for nerds, history buffs and fans of creative non-fiction. "
523,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2968341-linda-isakson,5,"I don't normally review non-fiction reads, but this one is just too superb to pass up! A wonderful and engaging read from cover-to-cover. Sam Kean takes the periodic table of the elements, a chart that makes most people cringe at thoughts of high school (or college) chemistry, and turns it into a riveting drama about the table's origins and the hunt to find new elements. Science geeks will love the scientific jargon but you don't need a degree in chemistry to understand the fascinating stories behind the revolutionaries responsible for our modern day technologies. This is definitely a book you can read over and over and still find little morsels you might have previously missed. Kean is amusing, insightful and presents complex information in a very understable package. A must read for fans of scientific history."
524,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18206572-inken,4,"I really enjoyed this book – even the parts I couldn’t understand. I so wish we’d had this as a set text when I took chemistry in high school. Not only might I have understood the rubbish our teacher was spouting, I might’ve liked it and even passed the bloody thing! Nobody ever even bothered to explain the Periodic Table to us and why it looks the way it does. And it's true: watching a gallium spoon dissolve in a glass of water is pretty cool.I had no idea the world of chemistry and physics was such a hotbed of rivalry, gossip and scandal. Delicious stuff."
525,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80835-celeste-ng,0,"Fascinating to me as the daughter of a chemist--I grew up with periodic tables all around, quite literally (I had a periodic table placemat!). Some of these stories were familiar to me, but most were new. Highly recommended for those who want to why the periodic table matters, and to know more about how the elements have changed human lives, sometimes drastically."
526,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40823165-yibbie,1," Never would I have assumed that I would have to quit reading a book about chemistry because of a lewd scene, but I did. In his attempt to introduce us to different chemicals and explain their lives, the author personifies them as characters in a smutty romance. So I quit what was up till then, an interesting book. "
527,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,5,"I’ve been reading a lot of non-fiction lately, and for me, that’s really...well, unusual. If you had asked me a couple of years ago how I felt about non-fiction, I would have described it as eye-glazingly dull, a dry recitation of facts. But now I eagerly scour the non-fiction shelves at the library. I know -- it’s crazy!The only explanation is that non-fiction has gotten better. (It can’t be me that’s changed.) The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean is a fine example of this better, more interesting non-fiction. Kean doesn’t skimp on the facts. He’s packed his book with oodles of information about the elements. What saves his book from being merely a mind-numbing collection of elemental characteristics may be gleaned from the book’s full title: The Disappearing Spoon and Other Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of Elements.Yes, it’s the madness and weirdness that brings the elements to life, and Kean seems to have dug up a fascinating story for virtually every element on the periodic table. For example, the title’s disappearing spoon refers to a (nerdy) practical joke in which unsuspecting victims are given a gallium spoon to stir their tea. I was particularly interested in the stories surrounding the radioactive elements, which ranged from an ex-KGB spy that was murdered with polonium-laced sushi in 2006 to a boy scout that tried to build his own nuclear reactor.Reading non-fiction like this is not only painless, but fun, and I’m convinced that I’m retaining all of those pesky little facts better that I normally would because I’ve so enjoyed learning them. Just wait until we meet at the next dinner party and I regale you with tales of elemental hijinks. If you’ve long despaired of enjoying non-fiction, perhaps now is the time to give it another try. "
528,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,4,"I pretty much knew I was going to like this book as soon as I heard about it. I mean, come on, it's about science! Some of the factoids I learned in this book will stick with me for a long time, like the naturally occurring nuclear reactor in Africa, or the reason why the Washington monument is capped with aluminum. At first I was disappointed that the book had end notes instead of footnotes. I do like footnotes. However, many of them were so long that I understood the reason for it. I ended up just having two bookmarks, one for where I was in the book, and one for where I was in the end notes.On one hand, there were sections that I feel I would have liked better if it hadn't been so long since my last chemistry class. On the other hand, if I were more well-versed in chemistry, some of the stories wouldn't have been so new and interesting to me.There were one or two slow sections in this book, but the interesting sections more than balanced it out. More to the point, this was a book that made me feel smarter for having read it--that goes a long way.One minor quibble that bothered me is that while there were two blank periodic tables which I found quickly, the actual periodic table in the book comes so close to the end that I wasn't able to find it, and I was looking for one. I would have liked to have one to reference. By the time I found it, I was almost done with the book and didn't need it as much. If the periodic table had been printed as an end paper, or in the beginning, or even at the start of the end notes where I could have found it, that would have made it easier to understand some of what the author talked about. After all, it's been a while since high school chemistry, and I only look at that chart periodically. (ha ha)"
529,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1951489-amanda,4,"Think back to your high school chemistry class. Chances are, the artwork adorning the classroom probably contained a poster with the periodic table of the elements. For some reason, all through 7 chemistry classes, my favorite was tungsten.Pop quiz - what is the chemical symbol for tungsten? Why, ""W"" of course! Why not T or Tu or Tg?? The ""W""is for wolfram, the German name for tungsten. Without it, those handy incandescent lightbulbs would not operate if it weren't for those tungsten filaments.I've always had a soft spot for science trivia, and the periodic table of the elements is full of interesting stories. If you have the same soft spot, I'd recommend ""The Disappearing Spoon"" by Sam Keane. The title references a property of the element gallium. Gallium turns from a solid to a liquid at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the author, a favorite prank of grad students is to fashion spoons made of gallium and to hand them out with tea or coffee. The spoon looks like the metal of other silverware, but when used in tea or coffee, melts away - a disappearing spoon!Another reason this is a great book is that it humanizes many of the famous scientists. In reading through textbooks, you never see into the personal lives or professional struggles of the discoveries and constants described in the text. Yet in The Disappearing Spoon, you see the races to get published (discovering and naming rights to elements), the discouragement at being passed up for a Nobel Prize yet again, and how wars and politics shape the or stunt technology."
530,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933518-jason,5,"Sometimes books just fall in my lap....Although I do pretty much put myself in a position where they seem to fall from the sky at a brisk rate. I went to Barnes & Noble the other day with the wife, ostensibly to get a cup of coffee, and picked up this book and Jose Saramago's 'The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'. I couldn't tell you what it was about it that caught my attention. I'm doing that thing again where I read too many books at once, but despite my inward pleas to the contrary, I couldn't resist picking it up and starting to read. What a great book. Refreshing, endlessly intriguing. Every page was a pleasure. Basically a book like this tells me two things: what a whiny spoiled brat I am, and what a complete dimwitted ape I am. In these pages I read about a woman who rode horseback for 1200 miles through a Russian winter to get her kid to a college only to see him rejected, and she then rode 400 more miles to get him to yet another school after which she promptly, and understandably, died. That's just so Russian. Then I read about a man who not only invented the Bunsen burner, he also invented the Spectrometer, and subsequently discovered several new elements, all in the 1850s. I look at myself and realize I'm liable to get suicidal if we run out of half and half, and my greatest achievement in life has been to arrange The Police's 'Roxanne' for the ukulele. Sometimes a good dose of perspective is extremely illuminating. "
531,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3387843-celine,4,"Did you love it when your teacher told funny science anecdotes? Then The Disappearing Spoon might be the book for you.This book is exactly what it is made out to be. With a full title of The Disappearing Spoon And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, it tells you everything you should know. Kean starts with the periodic table, talks about how it was created, and from there, tells of fun, tragic, or interesting stories about all of the elements.Most of the science in The Disappearing Spoon is understandable with a high-school knowledge of chemistry. But even if you don't know enough chemistry, those parts can easily be skipped. Most of the book is heavily inspired by scientific history, rather than science itself. If you want to know more about the bickering and rivalries between chemists, this book is perfect. The Disappearing Spoon is highly entertaining, and it's clear the author has done extensive research into the lives of the scientists he talks about. My only gripe is that he has the tendency to lose direction sometimes, and flounders between all of the threads of stories he started, no longer clear on exactly what point he wanted to make. "
532,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,1,"I need to make a new shelf for this one and books like it...read, mostly. This is at times a ""cute book"" but in spite of it's promise it will help you if you have a deep abiding love of chemistry before you crack it open.It doesn't really appear to be organized all that well and isn't truly geared to the average reader. He opens up with his early fascination with mercury (the element, not the planet or the mythological deity) and how it led him into literature etc. Then he sets out to induce us all into the wonder/wonders that is/are the periodic table. I wasn't drawn into chemistry beyond what's required in high school, neither was I here. It didn't work, I lost interest quickly and wasn't interested in going on with the class.Enjoy if it's cup of tea...not mine. Maybe you'll like it, but I can't recommend it."
533,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"A fun read, for a certain value of fun. This is a book for science geeks, or those curious about science. If you're a full-fledged science geek, this could be a relatively light side read. If you're more of a layman, it's an opportunity to read some science that shouldn't be too far over your head, most of the time. I fall in the latter category. I wouldn't exactly call this a light read (though it's certainly easier going than some books that I've attempted) but the personable tone and fascinating stories kept me interested even when the going got a little tough. For a more science literate reader, those same stories would probably make it easier to get through the more familiar territory without getting bored. So yes, I did have fun, and I learned a few things, and I gave my brain a bit of a workout. Which is exactly what I like to see in a book about science."
534,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,3,"Since I have ditched my chemical engineering degree for a (once shiny) computer science one, whenever I see books like these I tend to gravitate towards them in pure nostalgia and consume them with a single minded passion. This book especially incited fond memories from my college days when we were consuming chemistry and its historical progress. I still have my periodic table poster that hung next to my bed for a good part of last decade. It was fun to read anecdotes, vignettes and author's own dealings with elements. The writing is casual, occasionally whimsical, terribly nostalgic and overall interesting. Though Kean refrains from overt use of technical jargon, it just isn't possible to escape it completely. With a dose of nostalgia, I enjoyed reading this."
535,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5984690-sean-o,5,"One of the top non-fiction books I've read this year. It's full of exactly the kind of stories I like: scientists and other clever people finding out about the universe. This one is all about the Periodic Table of Elements, and stories about every single element. Some get star treatment, but even ultra-rare Francium gets a shout out. The science is good and the writer doesn't dumb things down too much. He also makes excellent use of foot notes which provide great asides as well as jumping off points for further reading. "
536,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999881-geoff,3,This book is filled with stories about the discoveries of the elements of the periodic table - some I knew and many I had never heard before. 
537,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"This is a relatively slim book, but it’s packed with super interesting stories you never learned in chemistry, like:1) Scientists tracked the path of Lewis & Clark across America by looking for mercury deposits. The party took mercury tablets to “cure” ailments, and wherever they went #2, they left mercury in the soil2) 7 different elements were discovered in Ytterby, a tiny suburban town in Sweden3) the elements in the periodic table haven’t always been around: originally, there was just hydrogen. Through a variety of reactions, hydrogen (the simplest element) produced all other elements on the periodic table in our solar system. (This makes me wonder: what do other solar systems look like, elementally? Did they experience the same reactions yielding the same elements, or an entirely different set?)4) the creator of the death gas used in WW2 concentration camps, Zyklon B (well, the first version anyway, named Zyklon A—it got slightly tweaked) was Franz Haber, a Jewish man famous for killing many Allied soldiers in painful chemical ways during WWI. Zyklon B was later used to murder thousands of people, including Haber’s own relatives5) Two elements called niobium and tantalum (named after Niobe and Tantalus from Greek myth) are found in the the Congo, combined in a rock called coltan. Niobium and tantalum are metals used in cell phones. The huge demand for coltan in the late 1990s/early 2000s caused anarchy and devastation in the Congo6) A scientist named Seaborg who worked on the Manhattan Project discovered the elements americium (which powers smoke detectors, by the way) and curium in 1946. Rather than announcing it in a scientific journal, Seaborg announced it on a children’s show, Quiz Kids (a child asked Seaborg if he’d discovered any new elements lately, and he explained that he had; judging by the mail he received from schoolchildren, teachers across the globe refused to believe the children’s claims the next week in school)7) the first antibacterial drug wasn’t penicillin (the first antibiotic)—in 1932, a man named Domagk discovered that Prontosil, an industrial dye, could be injected into a sick person to cure them of a bacterial infection (Domagk initially made this discovery on mice; when his daughter Hildegarde tripped while holding a sewing needle and acquired a life-threatening infection, Domagk gave it a whirl in humans, and she got better)8) Tellurium smells strongly of garlic. Beryllium tastes like sugar (despite being a toxic metal). Potassium tastes like salt!9) the European Union, appropriately, uses europium in the ink on euros to show they’re not counterfeit10) In the African nation of Gabon, there exists the only natural nuclear fission reactor known to exist, called Oklo—fueled by uranium, blue-green algae (pond scum), and plain water (the only reason there’s not a gigantic hole burned into Gabon? When the uranium reaches critical mass, it boils off the water, and without the water, the reaction stops). My favourite chapter was chapter 9 (on poisonous elements) because poison is cool. I was especially interested in how a local doctor (Noboru Hagino) discovered that cadmium was poisoning the people of Kamioka, Japan: with the help of a public health professor, he plotted the homes of all the people who came down with the mysterious disease (known as itai-itai, or “ouch ouch” disease), and was able to discover that they all lived along the Jinzu River, which carried cadmium, a waste product from the local mine. This reminded me a lot of The Ghost Map, which, as in the case of Kamioka, tells the story of how a local doctor and a public health professional teamed up to trace the root of a deadly disease (cholera, in that case) using mapping. (Speaking of London—I was also interested to see Alexander Litvinenko, murdered by polonium-spiked tea in a London sushi restaurant, get a mention; I recently saw his grave in Highgate Cemetery). Definitely a fun read if you have a spare afternoon and wish you knew the more fun side of chemistry."
538,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4053034-laura,1,"I didn't finish this book. I couldn't finish this book because the parts of this book that are about science I know could most generously be described as ""missleading at best"". If that's the case about the stuff I know, how much is true in the stuff I don't know? I'm called upon to teach some chemistry despite the fact my real chemistry knowledge pretty much ends at physical chemistry and astrochemistry - so I really don't need to fill my head with stories and theories that are pale reflections of the current state of knowledge when I don't read enough of the literature to judge how correct they are.I'm not sure where the author looked up the theory of solar system formation he gives in Chapter 4, but it wasn't in anything written in the last 20 years. If he'd turned in what's written here on an astronomy exam when I was in a generous mood I might give him a point or two for having a couple of right ideas in there, but he'd still have an F.I started to get a clue there was a problem when the author called the collision of comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 (1993 F2) with Jupiter ""intergalactic"". Huh? How is the collision of two solar system objects intergalactic? There's no evidence that SL9 was an extra-solar comet, much less an extra-galactic comet, but ok, he's using an odd hyperbole to make it sound more exciting. Overall the book has a very bubbly, casual style to it so I'll let him use this oddly chosen word. Things get worse however, when he implies Jupiter is the reason C/Hale-Bopp (1995 O1) came into the inner solar system. At this point I'm still assuming he knows that is not true and he's wording things really poorly, but I'm beginning to doubt I know enough of the science in other parts of the book to be able to see through this sort of thing elsewhere. However, it's when he writes ""Because the stellar wind blew only the lightest, most common elements as far out as Jupiter, it should have the same basic elemental composition as real stars"", that I pause and make a WTF!?! note in the margin. It takes me half a lecture or more to explain our current understanding of solar system formation, so I won't go through it all in this review, but the above is pure nonsense. More pure nonsense occurs when he mentions that the cloud of gas and dust our solar system formed out of was flat. There's no evidence for that and it's extremely unlikely dynamically. Simple physics flattens any shape of cloud collapsing under gravity to a spinning disk.Coming back to the missleading at best parts, we are told there are apparently mini-nuclear booms in stars counterbalancing gravity rather than thermal pressure. Booms implies a series of nuclear bombs going off when it is actually the steady rate of fusion in the interior of the Sun that causes the thermal pressure that balances gravity. Finally, given that I'm a planetary scientist, I just can't let slide the description of the Moon forming due to an ""asteroid or comet impact"". Well ok. If you want to call a roughly Mars sized planetesimal an asteroid or comet. However, there aren't any Mars sized planetesimals left that we'd call an asteroid or comet today. Mars is really in no danger of being demoted from planet-hood.I haven't picked on every problem with the astrophysics presented in this chapter, but all this and more brings me to the end of Chapter 4 with no trust the author knows anything about what he's talking about. This is likely not true given all the glowing reviews, one even appearing in the well respected journal Nature (I'm guessing a review by a chemist that knew no astronomy?). But having lost my trust it can't be regained, and I won't be finishing this book."
539,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9255064-melissa,4,"Chemistry has never been my thing. I hated it in high school (except for the part where we melted mechanical pencils over the Bunsen burner). Recently watching the chemistry Crash Course episodes has reminded me that chemistry is not just the boring science class I struggled to stay awake through in high school. Chemistry is everything around us and understanding a bit about it will help me better understand the way the world works.So I picked up The Disappearing Spoon with that in mind and was richly rewarded. Kean’s writing style was fun and made the subject matter interesting. He talks not only about the science behind each element, but about the scientists who discovered them and the impact they had on the world. For example Mendeleev, who is credited with creating the Periodic Table, had a fascinating start. He was born in Siberia, the youngest of 11 children. His father died when he was only 13 and his mother worked incredibly hard to give him the chance to go to school. Imagine having to overcome all of those things just to be able to go to school! Another favorite of mine was Marie Curie. Her fascinating life, including a marriage that was far ahead of its time and the discovery of multiple elements was so interesting. She won a Nobel Prize in a time when women in America weren’t even allowed to vote. I would love to a biography that focused solely on her.The periodic table has changed the world in both positive and negative ways. Kean doesn’t shy away from the damage that’s been done because of the discovery of a new element. He talks about the effects of vaccinations and medicines and also at the way chemistry made things like the atom bomb possible. When cell phones became wildly popular in the 1990s the fight to find more of the metal used to create them caused the Congo to explode with fighting. People were in a frenzy to provide the metal that was in such high demand. “Overall more than 5 million people have died in Congo since the mid-1990s, making it the biggest waste of life since World War II. The fighting there is proof that in addition to all the uplifting moments the Periodic table has inspired it can also play on humankind's worst, most inhumane instincts.”This balanced look at the Table reminds us that with great knowledge (just like great power) comes great responsibility. Almost any scientific advance can be used for good or bad and there will always be a struggle to use it correctly. BOTTOM LINE: The most interesting book I’ve read ever read about chemistry and one that kept me intrigued the entire time. We live in a truly remarkable world and I’ll never regret reading a book that opens up a new corner of that world to me."
