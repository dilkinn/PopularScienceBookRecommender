0,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"The doorbell rang the other day and when I answered it, there was a very slick guy in a nice suit standing there and a limousine parked at the curb. He started shaking my hand and wormed his way into the house.“Mr. Kemper, I’m John Doe with Dee-Bag Industries Incorporated. I need you to sign some paperwork and take a ride with me. Don’t worry, I’ll have you home in a day or two,” he said. Then he pulled a document out of his briefcase, set it on the coffee table and pushed a pen in my hand. “Wait a second. What the hell is this all about?” I said as I tried to pick up the paper to read it, but Doe kept trying to force my hand with the pen down on it so I couldn‘t see what it said.“Oh, that’s just legal mumbo-jumbo. You’d rather try and read your mortgage agreement than this old thing. Just put your name down and let’s be on our way, shall we?” he said.There was a brief scuffle, but I managed to distract him by messing up his carefully gelled hair. As he shrieked and ran around looking for a mirror, I finally got to read the document.“This is a medical consent form. What’s going on?” I demanded as I shook the paper at him. Once he had combed and smoothed his hair back into perfection, Doe sighed.“Very well, Mr. Kemper. I guess I’ll have to come clean. Do you remember when you had your appendix out when you were in grade school?”“Sure. That gave me one of my better scars, but that was like 30 years ago. Why are you here now?” I asked.“You’re probably not aware of this, but your appendix was used in a research project by DBII,” Doe said.“Really? I assumed it just got incinerated or used in the hospital cafeteria’s meatloaf special. Why would anyone want to study my rotten appendix?”“Oh, all kinds of research is done on tissue gathered during medical procedures. Most people don’t know that, but it’s very common,” Doe said.“OK, but why are you here now?”“Well, your appendix turned out to be very special. It was secreting some kind of pus that no one had seen before. After many tests, it turned out to be a new chemical compound with commercial applications. So a patent was filed based on that compound and turned into a consumer product,” Doe admitted.“That sounds disgusting. What was it used in? Because I want to make sure to never buy it,” I said.“It’s the basis for the adhesive on Post-It Notes,” Doe said.“Are you freaking kidding me? Post-It Notes are based on my old appendix?”“I’m absolutely serious, Mr. Kemper. Now we at DBII need your help. Unfortunately for us, you haven’t had anything removed lately. So I have to get your consent if we’re going to do further studies,” Doe said.“But you already got my goo-seeping appendix. I don’t have another one,” I said. “True, but sales have been down for Post-It Notes lately. So after the marketing and research boys talked it over for a while, they thought we should bring you in for a full body scan. Maybe you’ve got a spleen giving out or something else that we could pull out and see if we could use it,” Doe said.“This is pretty damn disturbing,” I said.“Why? You’re an organ donor, right? Same thing,” Doe said.“I don’t consider someone lucking into an organ if the Chiefs win a play-off game and I have a goddamn heart attack the same thing as companies making money off tissue I had removed decades ago and didn’t know anything about,” I said.“Fortunately, the American government and legal system disagree. So how about it, Mr. Kemper? Will you come with me?” Doe asked.“I dunno. What’s my end of this? You already owe me a fat check for the Post-Its.”“Oh, no. You won’t get any money from the Post-Its, or if any future discoveries from your tissues lead to more gains.” Doe said.“That’s complete bullshit!”“Again, the legal system disagrees with you. But this is for science, Mr. Kemper. You don’t want to hold up medical scientific research that could save lives, do you?”“It’s for Post-It Notes!”“Maybe, but who is to say that the cure for some terrible disease isn't lurking somewhere in your genes? Could you live with yourself if you prevented crucial medical research just because you were ticked off that you didn’t get any money for your appendix? Remember that it’s not like you could have NOT had your appendix removed. At least, not if you wanted to keep living. And I highly doubt that you would have had the resources to have it studied and discovered the adhesive for yourself even if you would have taken it home with you in a jar after it was removed. We’re the ones who spent all that money to get some good out of a piece of disgusting gunk that tried to kill you. So shouldn’t we be compensated? What are you? Some kind of damn dirty hippie liberal socialist?” Doe said in disgust“You’re a hell of a corporate lackey, Doe,” I said.“Thank you.”“Fine. I’ll do it,” I said as I signed the form. “But I want some free Post-It Notes.”“No deal. Steal them from work like everyone else,” Doe said.******Obviously, I‘m a big fat liar and none of this happened, but I really did have my appendix out as a kid. Plus, my tonsils got yanked and I’ve had my fair share of blood taken over the years. What this book taught me is that it’s highly likely that some of my scraps are sitting in frozen jars in labs somewhere. Yours, too. If any of us have anything unique in our tissues that may be valuable for medical research, it’s possible that they’d be worth a fortune, but we’d never see a dime of it.Henrietta Lacks couldn’t be considered lucky by any stretch of the imagination. A black woman who grew up poor on a tobacco farm, she married her cousin and moved to the Baltimore area. Her husband apparently liked to step out on her and Henrietta ended up with STDs, and one of her children was born mentally handicapped and had to be institutionalized. In 1951, Henrietta was diagnosed with cervical cancer by doctors at Johns Hopkins. During her biopsy, cell samples were taken and given to a researcher who had been working on the problem of trying to grow human cells. Henrietta’s cancer spread wildly, and she was dead within a year. But her cells turned out to be an incredible discovery because they continued growing at a very fast rate. The doctor at Johns Hopkins started sharing his find for no compensation, and this coincided with a large need for cell samples due to testing of the polio vaccine. The HeLa cells would be crucial for confirming that the vaccine worked and soon companies were created to grow and ship them to researchers around the world. Since then, Henrietta’s cells have been sent into outer space and subjected to nuclear tests and cited in over 60,000 medical research papersUnfortunately, no one ever asked Henrietta’s permission and her family knew nothing about the important role her cells played in medicine for decades. Poor and with little formal education, Henrietta’s children were confused by what was actually done to their mother and upset when they learned that her tissue was part of a multi-million dollar industry that they‘ve received no compensation from..Rebecca Skloot has written a fascinating book that clearly outlines why Henrietta’s cells were so important, why she went unrecognized for decades, the pain it’s caused her family, and the way that new medical discoveries over the last sixty years have opened a potential Pandora’s Box of legal and ethical issues regarding tissue collection, research, patents and money. This book brings up a lot of issues that we’re probably all going to be dealing with in the future. Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog."
1,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"This is an all-gold five star read.It's actually two stories, the story of the HeLa cells and the story of the Lacks family told by a journalist who writes the first story objectively and the second, in which she is involved, subjectively. The contrast between the poor Lacks family who cannot afford their medical bills and the research establishment who have made millions, maybe billions from these cells is ironic and tragic. It has been established by other law cases that if the family had gone for restitution they would not have got it, but that's a moot point as they couldn't afford a lawyer in any case. I have seen some bad reviews about this book. People who think that the story of the Lacks - poor rural African-Americans who never made it 'up' from slavery and whose lifestyle of decent working class folk that also involves incest, adultery, disease and crime, they just dismiss with 'heard it all before' and 'my family despite all obstacles succeeded so what is wrong with the Lacks?' I wonder if these people who not only totally can't see the wonderful writing that brings these people to life and who so lack in compassion themselves are the sort of people who oppose health care for the masses? As an extremely wealthy American tourist once put it to me, he had earned good health care by his hard work and success in life, it was one of the perks, why waste good money on, say, a a triple-bypass on someone who hasn't even succeeded enough to afford health insurance? That they were a drain on society, non-contributors and not the way America needed to go to move forward.I don't think you can rate people by what they have achieved materially. Success depends a great deal on opportunity and many don't have that. Henrietta Lacks didn't have it and her children didn't have it, not even her grandchildren made much of a way for themselves, but the next generation, the great grandchildren - ah now they are going in for Masters degrees and maybe their children will be major contributors. The author intends to recompense the family by setting up a scholarship for at least one of them. All of us came originally from poverty and to put down those that are still mired in the quicksand of never having enough spare cash to finance an education is cruel, uncompassionate and hardly looking to the future.HeLa cells have given us our future. They are the most researched and tested human cells in existence. All of us have benefited from the medical advances made using them and the book is recognition of what a great contribution Henrietta Lacks and her family with all their donations of tissue and blood, mostly stolen from them under false pretences, have made. Indeed one of the researchers who looks like having told a lot of lies (and then lied about that) in order to get the family to donate blood to further her research is still trying to get them to donate more. She's a hard-nosed scientist, with an excellent job and income and to her the Lacks are no more than providers of raw material. Sometimes you can't make hard and fast rulings. No I don't think we should have to give informed consent for experiments to be done on tissue or blood donated during a procedure or childbirth - that would slow medical research unbearably. I don't think cells should be identifiable with the donor either, it should be quite anonymous (as it now is). However, there is only ever one 'first' in any sphere and that one does deserve recognition and now with the book, some 50 years after her life ended, Henrietta Lacks has it. Good on yer, Rebecca Skloot, you've done a good thing here."

“She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?”
I've moved this book on and off my TBR for years. The truth is that, with few exceptions, I'm generally turned off by the thought of non-fiction. I'm a fan of fictional stories, and I think I've always felt that non-fiction will be dry, boring and difficult to get through. Especially a book about science, cells and medicine when I'm more of a humanities/social sciences kinda girl.But this book... it's just so interesting. It's written in a very easy, journalistic style and places the author into the story (some people didn't like this, but I thought it felt like you were going along for the journey). It's all the interesting bits of science, full of eye-opening and shocking discoveries, but it's also about history, sociology and race.I started reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks while sat next to my boyfriend. Every so often I would unknowingly gasp or mutter ""oh my god"" and he was like ""what? what?"" and I hadn't even realized I'd done it out loud. It's just full of surprises - and every one is true! It uncovers things you almost certainly didn't know about. And it just shows that sometimes real life can be nastier, more shocking, and more wondrous than anything you could imagine.Maybe you've heard of HeLa in passing, maybe you don't know anything about these cells that helped in cancer research, in finding a polio vaccine, in cloning, in gene mapping and discovering the effects of an atom bomb; either way, this tells an incredible and awful story of a poor, black woman in the American South who was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She is given back her humanity, becoming more than a cluster of cells and being shown for the tough, spirited woman she was. From her own family life to the frankly nauseating treatment of black patients in the 1950s, her story emerges.Not only that, but this book is about the injustices committed by the pharmaceutical industry - both in this individual case (how is it that Henrietta's family are dirt poor when she has revolutionized medicine?) and on a larger scale (during the 1950s, many prisoners were injected with cancer as part of medical experiments!). It's hard to believe what so-called ""professionals"" have gotten away with throughout history - things that we generally associate with Nazi death camps.I honestly could not put it down. Maybe because it's not just about science and cells, but is mainly about all of the humanity and social history behind scientific discoveries. Maybe because Skloot is so damn passionate about her subject and that passion is transferred to the reader. Whatever the reason, I highly recommend it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"
3,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"This was a really good book that leaves one with more questions than it answers, especially at this moment with the explosion in investment and growth in health/biotech. A lot of those questions are ones I wouldn't know how to answer myself either. I think it's really important though that we all start grappling with and instituting better processes around things like informed consent. Also really horrible to think about this in larger societal terms, in the context of institutional racism, and the ways in which the Lacks family still is so socioeconomically disadvantaged while private biotechnology companies sell their mother's cells for so much money. I just feel so extremely uncomfortable with that. I think I wouldn't care so much if the cells were just part of the commons, available for free, or extremely cheaply, but to know people are profiting off of it, it really is quite disgusting. I try not to bring my politics to bear here quite too often but this really really makes me feel strongly that commercialization of things in biological research, especially people's biological matter and tissue shouldn't be happening. This whole situation just feels quite perverse honestly and the book left me feeling disheartened. The dual dehumanization of the Lacks family through science and commercialization is horrifying. And I think if we wants things to be better moving forward both need to be addressed, not just one."
4,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"On October 4, 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a thirty-one-year old black woman, died after a gruesome battle with a rapidly metastasizing cancer. During her treatment, the doctors at Johns Hopkins took some cells from her failing body and used them for research. This was not an unusual thing to have done in 1951. But the cells that came from Ms. Lacks’ body were unusual. They had qualities that made them uniquely valuable as research tools. Labeled “HeLa”, Henrietta’s cells were reproduced by the billions over the following sixty years and have been instrumental in experiments across a wide range of biological science. Today, HeLa cells are sold by the vial at impressive prices. Yet, Ms. Lacks’ family has seen not a penny of compensation from the work that has been made possible by their relative’s unique cells. Rebecca Skloot - from Powell'sRebecca Skloot, a science writer with articles published in many major outlets, spent years looking into the genesis of these cells. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells four stories. First is the tale of HeLa cells, and the value they have been to science; second is the life of, arguably, the most important cell “donor” in history, and of her family; third is a look at the ethics of cell “donation” and the commercial and legal significance of rights involved; and fourth is the Visible Woman look at Skloot’s pursuit of the tales. Each story is significant. The contribution of HeLa cells has been huge and it is important to know how these cells came to be so widely used, and what are the characteristics that make them so valuable. Skloot goes into a reasonable level of detail for those of us who do not make our living in a lab coat. She adds information on how cell cultures can become contaminated, and how that impacts completed research. She also offers a description of telomeres, strings of DNA at the end of chromosomes critical to longevity, and key to the immortality of HeLa cells. Fascinating stuff. Henrietta Lacks - From Science And FilmSkloot constructs a biography of Henrietta, and patches together a portrait of the life of her family, from her ancestors to her children, siblings and other relations. It is with a source of pride, among other emotions, that her family regards Henrietta’s impact on the world. Skloot delves into these feelings, and the experiences the Lacks family members have had over the decades with people trying to write about Henrietta, and people trying to exploit their interest in Henrietta for dark purposes.The author had to overcome considerable family resistance before she was able to get them to meet with and ultimately open up to her. She takes us through her process, showing who she talked with, when, and the result of those conversations, what institutions she contacted re locating and gaining access to information about Henrietta and some other family members. Most interesting, and at times frustrating, is her story of how she gained the trust of some, if not all, of the Lacks family. This is like presenting a how-to of her research process, a blow-by-blow description of the way research is done in the real world, and it is very enlightening.The Immortal Tale of Henrietta Lacks has received considerable acclaim. It is all well-deserved. The book is an eye-opening window into a piece of our history that is mostly unknown. It presents science in a very manageable way and gives us plenty to think about the next time we have a blood test or any other medical procedure. This book may not be as immortal as Henrietta’s cells, but it will stay with you for a very long time.The HBO Film airs on April 22, 2017==============================EXTRA STUFF8/8/13 - NY Times article - A Family Consents to a Medical Gift, 62 Years Later3/29/17 - Washington Post - On the eve of an Oprah movie about Henrietta Lacks, an ugly feud consumes the family - by Steve Hendrix"
5,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34369915-nick,5,This is such an important story. HeLa cells were a miracle to humanity and all thanks to Hernietta Lacks and the doctor.It is a must-read.
6,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2085746-laura,3,"Fascinating and Thought-Provoking.
Strengths:
*Fantastically interesting subject!One woman's cancerous cells are multiplied and distributed around the globe enabling a new era of cellular research and fueling incredible advances in scientific methodology, technology, and medical treatments. This strain of cells, named HeLa (after Henrietta Lacks their originator), has been amazingly prolific and has become integrated into advancements of science around the world (space travel, genome research, pharmaceutical treatments, polio vaccination, etc). *Thought-Provoking Ethical Questions This book makes you ponder ethical questions historically raised by the unfolding sequence of events and still rippling currently. Ex. 1) Informed consent: Henrietta did not provide informed consent (not required in those days). Ex. 2) Genetic rights/non-rights: her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later. Ex. 3) Patents and profits for biologic material: zero profits realized by Henrietta or her descendants; multiple-millions in profits have been realized by individuals and corporations utilizing her genetic material.*Biographical description of Henrietta and interviews with her family.  The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications. We're reading about actual, valuable people and historic events.
Weaknesses:
*Framework: the book is framed around the author's journey of writing the story and her interactions with Henrietta's family. I thought the author got in the way and would have preferred to have to read less of her journey and more coverage of the science involved and its ethical implications. I found myself distinctly not caring how many times the author circled the block or how many trips she made to Henrietta's birthplace.*Lack of Clarity: By mid-point through the book, I was wishing the biographical approach was more refined and focused. The narrative swerved through the author's interest in various people as she encountered them along the way: Henrietta, Henrietta's immediate family, scientists, Henrietta's extended family, a neighborhood grocery store owner, a con artist, Henrietta's youngest daughter, Henrietta's oldest daughter, etc. Everything was a side dish; no particular biography satisfied as a main course.
Bottom Line:
This book won't join my 'to re-read' shelf...but has whetted my appetite for further exploration of this important woman, fascinating topic and intriguing ethical questions.I was left wanting more:-more detail surrounding the science involved, -more coverage of past and present ethical implications-a more refined biography of Henrietta, and -a more focused look at the impact and implications of the HeLa cell strain line on Henrietta's descendants."

A young black mother dies of cervical cancer in 1950 and unbeknownst to her becomes the impetus for many medical advances through the decades that follow because of the cancer cells that were taken without her permission. This book evokes so many thoughts and feelings, sometimes at odds with one another. It is thought provoking and informative in the details and heartbreaking in the rendering of the personal story of Henrietta Lacks. I was madder than hell that people/companies made loads of money on the Hela cell line while some members of the Lacks family didn’t have health insurance . Yet, I am grateful for the research advances that made a polio vaccine possible, advanced cancer research and genetics, and so much more.Rebecca Skloot does a wonderful job of presenting the moral and legal questions of medical research without consent meshing this with the the human side giving a picture of the woman whose cells saved so many lives. We get to know her family, especially her daughter Deborah who worked tirelessly with the author to discover what happened to her mother. This made it all so real - not just a recitation of the facts. The scientific aspects are very detailed but understandable. It was the sections on Henrietta and her family that I wanted to read the most.In 1950 there was “no formal research oversight in the United States.” Years later there are laws on “informed consent “ and how medical research is conducted, and protection of privacy for medical records. Yet even today, there are controversies over the ownership of human tissue. The in depth research over years in writing this book is evident and I believe a heartfelt effort to recognize Henrietta Lacks for her unwitting contribution to medical research."
8,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114573-chelsea,3,"This could have been an incredible book. Henrietta Lacks' story is finally told--and Skloot makes very clear how important Lacks' cells have been to the last 60 years of science and, paradoxically, how much Henrietta and her family suffered because those cells were taken from Henrietta without her consent. But in her effort to contrast the importance and profitability of Henrietta's cells with the marginalization and impoverishment of Henrietta's family, Skloot makes three really big mistakes. First, she's not transparent about her own journalistic ethics, which is troubling in a book about ethics. Did the Lacks family end up benefiting from her book financially? Did all Lacks give permission for their depictions in the book? We never know. Second, Skloot's narration when describing the Lacks family suffering--sexual abuse, addiction, disability, mental illness--lacks sensitivity; it often feels clinical and sometimes even voyeuristic. Again, this is disturbing in a book that concerns the importance of dignity, consent, etc.Finally, Skloot inserts herself into the story over and over, not so subtly suggesting that she is a hero for telling Henrietta's story. Sometimes, it appears that she is making the very offensive suggestion that she, a highly educated unreligious white woman, has healed the Lacks family by showing them science and history."
9,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731872-kathleen,3,"My thoughts on this book are kind of all over the place. I feel for the Lacks family, I really do. It's hard to read about the poverty and lack of education and the cavalier approach towards informed consent in the early days of Johns Hopkins Research Hospital. The fact that the HeLa cell line is the foundation of so much valuable research is rightfully a source of pride for the family of Henrietta Lacks. I don't think they will ever see monetary compensation for their mother's cancer cell line, however. That horse left the barn a long, long time ago.Furthermore, I don't feel the admiration for the author of this book like I think many others do. She wanted to make herself out to be different than all the rest of the people who wrote about the woman behind the HeLa cell line but I only saw the similarities. Yes, she has established a scholarship fund for the descendants of Henrietta Lacks but I got tired of hearing again and again how she financed her research herself. I think the exploitation is there, just prettied up a bit with a lot of self-congratulatory descriptions of how HARD she had to try to talk to the family and how MANY times she called asking for interviews. At times I felt like she badgered them worse than the unethical people who had come before.The sadness of this story is really about the devastation of a family when its unifying force, a strong mother, is removed. Piled on with more sadness about the appalling institutional conditions for mentally handicapped patients (talking about Henrietta Lacks' oldest daughter) back in the 50's and you have tragedy on top of more tragedy."
10,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,4,"This is a very powerful and informative story. Also, with the history of personal freedoms, civil rights, and right to privacy/requiring consent, this is a very important books. I am not sure the details about the science involved in the story will appeal to all. Just the same as how those who are here for the science may be disinterested in the background stories of the people involved. But, if you think you will like one of the other, I don’t think the one you don’t care for will be distracting.With that in mind, I will continue with the statement that it really is two books: the science and the people. First, the background of cell and tissue research in the last 100 years is intriguing and to hear about all of the advances and why Henretta Lacks was key to them is fascinating. Second, the background of not only the Lacks family, but also others who have had their tissues/cells used for research without permission, gives a lot of food for thought. Almost every medical advancement, and many scientific advancements, in the past 60 years are because of Henrietta Lacks. But, questions about the consent she gave, what she understood about her cells being used, and how much the family has benefited are all questioned and discussed. It really hits hard to think that you may have no control over parts of you once they are no longer part of your body. Also, the fiscal and research ramifications of giving people more rights over their body tissue/cells really creates a huge Catch-22. As I had surgery earlier this year that involved some tissue being removed for analysis, it started to make me wonder what I signed on all those forms and if my cells might still be out there being used for research.The only part of the book that kind of dragged for me was the time that the author spent with the family late in the book. After listening to an interview with the author it was surprising to hear that this part of the book may have been her original focus (how the family has dealt with the revelations surrounding the use of their mother’s cells), but to me it kind of dragged and got repetitive. I don’t think it is bad and others may find it interesting, it just was what brought down my interest in the story a little bit.If you like science-based stories, medical-based stories, civil/personal rights history, and/or just love a decent non-fiction, I think this book is very worth checking out."
11,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1992225-liz-nutting,5,"When I was a graduate student in the field of Ethics, one of my favorite pedagogical strategies, as both a teacher and a student, was the case study. A good case study can make an abstract ethical issue more concrete. A really good case study can turn a deeply contentious issue into an opportunity for thoughtfulness and compassion; right and wrong (to the extent that those concepts even belong in the study of ethics) are nuanced by descriptions of circumstances or values or human need that can make it easier to see and hear and believe the ones on the other side(s) of an issue. Often the case studies are hypothetical, or descriptions of actual cases pared to ""just the facts, ma'am,"" without all the possible extenuating circumstances that can shape difficult decisions. For some students, this causes great angst. How could they be asked to make a judgment, especially one that might involve life or death, without knowing all the details? And of course, at the end of the lesson, everyone wants to know what really happened, how things turned out ""in real life."" On those rare occasions when we actually do know something of the outcome, it is clear that knowing what ""really"" happened almost never makes the decision easier, clearer, or less agonizing. And that is what makes The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks so deeply compelling and challenging. It is the rare story of the outcome of a seemingly inconsequential decision by a doctor and a researcher in 1951, one that few at that time would have ever seen as an ethical decision, let alone an unethical one. A researcher studying cell cultures needs samples; a doctor treating a woman with aggressive cervical cancer scrapes a few extra cells of that cancer into a Petri dish for the researcher. The missing cells had no bearing whatsoever on the outcome of the woman's disease, so no harm done. A few weeks later the woman is dead, but her cancer cells are living in the lab. The bare bones ethical issue at stake--whether it is ethically warranted to take a patient's tissues without consent and subsequently use them for scientific and medical research--is even now not a particularly contentious one...yet. Legally, the case law is settled: tissue removed in the course of medical treatment or testing no longer belongs to the patient. It is, in essence, refuse, and one woman's trash is another man's treasure. Ethically, almost all the professional guidelines encourage researchers to obtain consent, but they have no teeth (and most were non-existent in 1951 anyway). In reality, the vast majority of the tissue taken from patients is of limited use. But there are those rare times when a single person's cells have the potential to break open the worlds of science and medicine, to the benefit of millions--and the enrichment of a very few. Such was the case with the cells of cervical cancer taken from Henrietta Lacks at Johns Hopkins University hospital. HeLa cells grew in the lab of George Gey. And grew. And grew, unlike any cell before it. Next, they were carried to a different laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, where Jonas Salk used them to successfully test his polio vaccine, and thus the cancer that had killed Henrietta Lacks directly led to the healing of millions worldwide. Soon HeLa cells would be in almost every major research laboratory in the world. They traveled to Asia to help find a cure for hemorrhagic fever and into space to study the effects of zero gravity on human cells. Even today, almost 60 years after Henrietta's death, HeLa cells are some of the most widely used by the scientific community. With such immeasurable benefits as these, who could possibly doubt the wisdom of Henrietta's doctor to take a tiny bit of tissue? But the ""real"" story is much more complicated. Henrietta Lacks was uneducated, poor and black. Her cancer was treated in the ""colored"" ward of Johns Hopkins. Her death left five children without their mother, to be raised by an abusive cousin. Should any of that matter in weighing the morality of taking tissue from a patient without her consent, especially in light of the benefits? God knows our country's history of medical experimentation on the poor and minority populations is not pretty. Ironically, one of the laboratories researching with HeLa cells in the 1950s was the one at the Tuskegee Institute--at the very same time that the infamous syphilis studies were taking place. In light of that history, Henrietta's race and socioeconomic status can't help but be relevant factors in her particular case. But her children's status? What bearing does that have? According to author Rebecca Skloot, in ethical discussions of the use of human tissue, ""[t]here are, essentially, two issues to deal with: consent and money."" Both become issues for Henrietta's children. The family didn't learn until 1973 that their mother's cells had been taken, or that they'd played such a vital role in the development of scientific knowledge. They spent the next 30 years trying to learn more about their mother's cells. As they learned of the money made by the pharmaceutical companies and other companies as a direct result of HeLa cells, they inevitably asked questions about what share, if any, they were entitled to. As Henrietta's eldest son put it, ""If our mother so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?"" But even more than financial compensation, the family wants recognition--and respect--for their mother. They want the woman behind her contributions acknowledged for who she is--a black woman, a mother, a person with name longer than four letters. And they want to know the mother they never knew, to find out the facts of her death. In the lab at Johns Hopkins, looking through a microscope at her mother's cells for the first time, daughter Deborah sums it up: ""John Hopkin [sic] is a school for learning, and that's important. But this is my mother. Nobody seem to get that."" Would a fully informed Henrietta Lacks have made the decision to give her tissue to George Gey if asked? Would her decision either way have had any affect whatsoever on her children's future lives? We'll never know, of course. But reading the story behind the case study makes these questions far more potent than any ethics textbook can. And as science now unravels the strains of our DNA--thanks in no small part to HeLa--these are no longer inconsequential questions for any of us. Perhaps we, too, like the doctors and scientists who have long studied HeLa, can learn from the case study of Henrietta Lacks. "
12,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-bionic-jean,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is is an extraordinary book. By turns it is shocking, informative and tragic. There is brilliance - but also deep injustice. It is in part an account of the development of genetics, part social commentary, and partly the story of one woman, Henrietta Lacks. She was an African-American woman descended from slaves and one white slave-owner (Lacks), and she lived as many hundreds of black people still did even as late as the 1950's, in poverty in an old slave-cabin - the ""home-house"" - in East Baltimore. And although the events do not always make for easy reading, the author assures us that it is completely non-fiction. Nothing has been invented, nothing exaggerated. The author has done her level best to tell things as they were. Although the name ""Henrietta Lacks"" is comparatively unknown, ""HeLa"" cells are routinely used in scientific experiments worldwide today, and have been for decades. They are the only human cells thought to be scientifically ""immortal"" ie if they are provided with the correct culture and environment they do not die. They were cut from a tumour in the cervix of Henrietta Lacks a few months before she died in 1951; extracted because she had a particular virulent form of cancer. Despite extreme measures taken in the laboratories to protect the cells, human cells had always inevitably died after a few days. HeLa cells though, stayed alive in the petri dish, and proved to be virtually unstoppable, growing faster and stronger than any other cells known.These HeLa cells were used to develop the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilisation and a host of other medical treatments. They were sent on the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity. It is fair to say that they have helped with some of the most important advances in medicine. But there is a terrible irony and injustice in this. The people to benefit from this were largely white people. Henrietta Lacks's family and descendants suffered appalling poverty. Working from dawn to dusk in poisonous tobacco fields was the norm as soon as the children were able to stand. Moving from Virginia's tobacco production to Bethlehem Steel, a boiler manufacturer in South Boston, was little better, as they were then exposed to asbestos and coal. The families had intermingled for generations. Henrietta and Day, her husband, were first cousins, and this was by no means unusual. So the predisposition to illness was both hereditary and environmental. But access to medical help was virtually nil. Most hospitals accepted only whites, or grudgingly admitted so-called ""colored"" people to a separate area, which was far less well funded and staffed. The Lacks family had to travel a long way in order to be treated, and then were not allowed the privilege of proper explanations as to the treatment given - or the tissue samples extracted.At this time unusual cells were taken routinely by doctors wanting to make their own investigations into cancer (which at that time was thought to be a virus) and many other conditions. No permission was sought; none was needed. The Hippocratic oath doctors set such store by dates from the 4th Century BC, and makes no mention of it; neither did the law of the time require it. It was not until 1947, that the subject was raised. Nazi doctors had performed many ethically unsound operations and experiments on live Jews, and during the trials after the war the Nuremberg Code - a 10 point code of ethics - was set up. This states that, ""The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential."" Even then it was advice, not law. Rebecca Skloot says that Howard Jones, the doctor who had originally diagnosed Henrietta Lacks' cancer, said, ""Hopkins, with its large indigent black population, had no dearth of clinical material."" It was clearly a racial norm of the time. In fact to be fair, the white doctors had no real conception that what they were doing had an ethical side. George Gey and his assistants were responsible for isolating the genetic material in Henrietta's cells - an astonishing feat. Gey happily shared the cells with any scientists who asked. The issue of payment was never raised, but the HeLa cells fast became a commodity, and the Lacks's family, who were never consulted about anything, mistakenly assumed until very recently that Gey must have made a fortune out of them. As Henrietta's daughter Deborah said, ""Them white folks getting rich of our mother while we got nothin."" Skloot carefully chronicles some of the most shocking medical stories from these times. The reader infers from her examples that testing on the impoverished and disadvantaged was almost routine. One notorious study was into syphilis and apparently went on for 40 years. It was called the ""Tuskegee study"", and involved thousands of males at varying stages of the disease. At the time it was known that they could be cured by penicillin, but they were not given this treatment, in order that doctors could study the progress of the disease. In this case they were volunteers, but were encouraged by the offer of free travel to the hospital, a free meal when they got there, and the promise of $50 for their families after they died, for funeral expenses. There are many such poignant examples. The author also says that in 1954 thousands of chronically ill elderly people, convicts and even some children, were injected by a Dr. Chester Southam with HeLa cells, basically just to see what would happen. Of course many of them went on to develop cancer. One man who had Hela cells injected in his arm produced small tumours there within days. But the patients were never informed of this, and if they did happen to ask were told they were being ""tested for immunity"". (We are told that Southam was prosecuted for this much later in 1966.) It was not until 1957 that there was any mention in law of ""informed consent."" Confidentially and privacy violation issues came far later.After her death, four of Henrietta Lacks's children, Lawrence, Deborah, Sonny and Joe, were put in the charge of Ethel, a friend of the family who had been very envious of Henrietta. It appears that she was incredibly cruel to the children, hardly ever feeding them until late, after a day's work, when they would be given a meagre crust. She would also drag the youngest one, Joe, out of bed at will, and beat him unmercifully. Joe was only 4 months old when his mother died and grew up to have severe behavioural problems. In fact later on on life, all these children grew to have not only health problems (including all being almost deaf) but a myriad of social problems too - being involved in burglary, assault and drugs - and spent a lot of their lives in prison.One of Henrietta's five children had been put in ""Crownsville Hospital for the Negro Insane"" when she was still tiny, because Henrietta was too ill to care for her any more. The story of this child, which is gradually told through Skloot's text as more of it is revealed, is heart-breaking. It is not clear why Elsie was so slow, but her mental retardation is now thought to be partly due to syphilis, and partly due to being born on the home-house stone floor - which was routine for such families at the time - and banging her head during birth. It was not known what had subsequently happened to Elsie until Skloot's research, but then some records were discovered. A photograph of Elsie shows a miserable child apparently in pain in a distorted position. Apparently brain scans then necessitated draining the surrounding brain fluid. Never mind that the patient might then suffer violent headaches, fits and vomiting for 2-3 months until the fluid reformed; it gave a better picture. Many people had been sent to this institution because of ""idiocy"" or epilepsy; the assumption now is that that they were incarcerated to get them out of the way, and that tests like this, often for research, were routine. Figures from 1955, when Elsie died, showed that at that time the hospital had 2700 patients, which was 800 over the maximum capacity. The ratio of doctors to patients was 1 doctor for 225 patients.Add into this the appalling inhumanity of history where white people used black people for their own ends, and the fears of Henrietta's family and community become inevitable. There had been stories for generations of white-coated doctors coming at dead of night and experimenting on black people. This became confused - or perhaps vindicated - by the Ku Klux Klan. Stories of voodoo, charismatic religious experiences, dire poverty, lack of basic education (one of Henrietta's brothers was more fortunate in that he had 4 years' schooling in total) untreated health problems and the prevailing 1950's attitudes of never questioning the doctor, all fed into the mix resulting in ignorance and occasional hysteria.Much of the first part of this book includes descriptions of scientific research and discoveries; both the theory and practise of how genes were isolated. Alternating with this is the background to the racial tensions, and the history of Henrietta Lacks' ancestry and family. Rebecca Skloot, a science writer, had been fascinated by the potential story since school days, when she first heard of HeLa cells, but nobody seemed to know anything about them. She started this book in her 20's, and spent a decade researching it, financed by credit cards and student loans. As a white woman she was treated with gross suspicion by all Henrietta Lacks's family. Eventually she formed a good relationship with Deborah, but it took a year before Deborah would even speak to her, and Deborah's brothers were very resistant. Several of them were pastors, as was James Pullam, her husband. They believed the Bible literally and had many fears about how Henrietta's cells were used. Deborah herself could not understand how they were immortal. Could her mother's cells feel pain when they were exploded, or infected? Would they develop into half-human half-chicken freaks when they were split and combined with chicken cells? Were there millions of clones all looking like her mother wandering around London? The media worldwide had played its part in adding to these fears, which had been spawned by a genuine ignorance.The interviews with Henrietta's family, and the progress and discoveries Skloot made accompanied by Deborah in the second part of the book, do make the reader uneasy. Indeed parts of these passages read like a trashy novel. Skloot says she wanted to report the conversation verbatim, so the vernacular is reported intact. Fair enough. But there is a lot of, ""Deborah shouted"" or, ""Lawrence yelled"". Of course they did! All of Henrietta's children had severe health problems, probably due to a variety of factors; their environment, upbringing and genetic inheritance. They were all very hard of hearing, so yes, they would shout when amongst themselves. Add to this Skloot's tendency to describe the attributes and appearance of a family member as ""beautiful hazel-nut brown skin"" or ""twinkling eyes"" and there is a whiff of condescension which does not sit well. Does it add anything to this account? Would a description of the author as having ""raven-black hair and full glossy lips"" help? Of course not. The author may feel she is being complimentary; she is not. She is being patronising. But it is difficult to know how else the total incomprehension and ignorance of how a largely white society operated could have been conveyed, other than by this verbatim reportage, even though at worst it comes across as extremely crass, and at best gently humorous.It would be convenient to imagine that these appalling cases were a thing of the past. But the book continues detailing injustices until the date of its publication in 2010. Henrietta's son, Sonny had a quintuple bypass in 2003. Skloot reports, ""The last thing he remembered before falling unconscious under the anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened in medicine."" So far, so good. There was recognition. But Skloot then delivers the final shot, ""Sonny woke up more than $125,500 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery."" As Lawrence (Henrietta's eldest son) says elsewhere, ""It's not fair! She's the most important person in the world and her family [are] living in poverty. If our mother [is] so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""Henrietta's original cancer had in fact been misdiagnosed. It was discovered years later that because she had syphilis, she had the genital warts HPV virus, which does actually invade the DNA. There is an intriguing section on this, as well as the ""HeLa bomb"", where one doctor painstakingly proved to the whole of the scientific community that a lot of their research had been flawed, as HeLa cells were contaminating many of the other cells they had been working with and drawing conclusions from. They were so virulent that they could travel on the smallest particle of dust in the atmosphere, and because Gey had given them so generously, there was no real record of where they had all ended up.Deborah herself always lived in fear of inheriting her mother's cancer. Because of this she readily submitted to tests. Victor McKusick took blood samples, which Deborah believed were for ""cancer tests."" In fact though, Skloot claims, they were for his own research. This is another example of chronic misunderstanding. He knew of the family's mental anguish and the unfair treatment they had had. He thought she understood why he wanted the blood. He gave her an autographed copy of his book - a technical manual on Genetics. Of this, Deborah commented wryly, ""It would have been nice if he'd told me what the damn thing said too."" And again, ""I would like some health insurance so I don't got to pay all that money every month for drugs my mother cells probably helped to make.""In 2001, Skloot tells us, Christoph Lengauer, now the Head of Oncology in one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, said of Henrietta, ""Her cells are how it all started."" And to Deborah, ""Once there is a cure for cancer, it's definitely largely because of your mother's cells.""In 2005 the US government issued gene patents relating to the use of 20% of known human genes, including Alzheimer's, asthma, colon cancer and breast cancer. The injustices however, continue. Pharmaceutical companies, scientists and universities now control what research is done, and the costs of the resulting tests and therapies. An example of how this continues to impede scientific development according to the author is that of the company Myriad Genetics, who hold the patent on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. (These are the genes which are responsible for most hereditary breast cancers.) The company had arbitrarily set a charge of $3000 to have this test, amid furore amongst scientists. They had licensed the use of the test. Anyone who ignored it received a threat of litigation. Eventually in 2009 they were sued by the American Civil Liberties Union, representing a huge number of people including 150,000 scientists for inhibiting research. The commercialisation of human biological materials has now become big business.There seems to have been some attempts at restitution since this book was published, the most recent being in August 2013. There was an agreement between the family and The National Institutes of Health to give the family some control over the access to the cells' DNA code, and a promise of acknowledgement on scientific papers. The committee set to oversee this arrangement will have 6 members, 2 of whom will be members of the family. The wheels have been set in motion.All in all this is an important and startlingly original book by a dedicated and compassionate author. It speaks to every one of us, regardless of our colour, nationality or class. Skloot admitted that it took a long time to decide the structure of the book, in order to include all the important aspects that she wished to. There are three sections: ""Life"", ""Death"" and ""Immortality"", plus an ""Afterword"". The main thrust throughout is clearly the enduring injustice the Lacks family suffered. So perhaps the final words should be Joe's, or (as he changed his name when he converted to Islam in prison), Zakariyya's: ""I believe what them doctors did was wrong. They lied to us for 25 years, kept them cells from us, then they gonna say them things DONATED by our mother. Them cells was stolen! Those fools come take blood from us sayin they need to run tests and not tell us that all these years they done profitized off of her…. You don't lie and clone behind their backs. That's wrong - it's one of the most violating parts of this whole thing….Then doctors say her cells [are] so important and did all this and that to help people. But it didn't do no good for her, and it don't do no good for us. If me and my sister need something, we can't even go and see a doctor cause we can't afford it.""It's too late for some of Henrietta's family. For how many others will it also be too late?"

(Matthew 26:26-28, NIV Bible)From The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks: There's no way of knowing how many of Henrietta's cells are alive today. One scientist estimates that if you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown on a scale, they'd weigh more than 50 million metric tons--an inconceivable number, given that an individual cell weighs almost nothing....Her cells were part of research into the genes that cause cancer and those that suppress it; they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, and Parkinson's disease; and they've been used to study lactose digestion, sexually transmitted diseases, appendicitis, human longevity, mosquito mating, and the negative cellular effects of working in sewers....Like guinea pigs and mice, Henrietta's cells have become the standard laboratory workhorse.(The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, pp. 2-4)Questions:1) Assuming Jesus Christ was speaking literally, please calculate the total mass and volume of the Body of Christ consumed in the period between the Last Supper (c. 30-36 AD/CE) and the present day.

But what happens when her biological material generates billions of dollars for the drug and pharmaceutical industry, leaving her dirt poor descendants in the lurch?Yeah, I know I wrote that like the teaser for one of my mysteries but the only mystery here is how people who have profited from the diseased cells that killed a woman can sleep at night while her kids and grand kids don't have two nickels to rub together.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is really two stories. One of Henrietta Lacks and her cancer cells that lived decades beyond her years, and the other of Rebecca Skloot and the surviving members of the Lacks family.Henrietta Lacks married her counsin, contracted multiple STD's due to his philandering ways, and died of misdiagnosed cervical cancer by the time she was 30. However, the cancer that killed her survives today in the form of HeLa cells, which have been taken to the moon, exposed to every manner of radiation and illness, and all sorts of other experiments. While other people are raking in money due to the HeLa research, the surviving Lacks family doesn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of, bringing me to the real meat of the book: The pharmaceutical industry is a bunch of dickbags. Imagine having something removed that generated billions of dollars of revenue for people you've never met and still needing to watch your budget so you can pay your mortage. Fair? Shit no, but that's the way it is, apparently. It also seems illogical that you can patent things you didn't create but again, that's the way the cookie crumbles.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an eye-opening look at someone most of us have never heard of but probably owe some sort of debt to. Also, it drags the big money pharma companies out in the sun. Sadly, they do not burst into flames like the vampires they are. Four out of five stars. I'm going to go read something happy now."
15,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,5,"The gift of life is surely the greatest gift of all. So how can the story of the remarkable woman who gave that gift over and over again to millions of people have been overlooked for so long?In 1951 a poor African American woman in Maryland became an uninformed donor to medical science. Henrietta Lacks died at age 31 of cervical cancer at John Hopkins hospital in Baltimore. Then doctors discovered that tumor cells they had removed from her body earlier continued to thrive in the lab - a medical first.Before long, her cells, dubbed HeLa cells, would be used for research around the world, contributing to major advances in everything from cancer treatments to vaccines; from aging to the life cycle of mosquitoes; nuclear bomb explosions to effect of gravity on human tissue during flights to outer space. An estimated 50 million metric tons of her cells were reproduced; thousands of careers have been build, and initiated more than 60 000 scientific studies until now, but Henrietta Lacks never gave permission for that research, nor had her family.In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca Skloot gracefully tells the story of the real woman and her descendants; the history of race-related medical research, including the role of eugenics; the struggles of the Lacks family with poverty, politics and racial issues; the phenomenal development of science based on the HeLa cells, in a language that can be understood by everyone. She combined the family's story with the changing ethics and laws around tissue collection, the irresponsible use of the family's medical information by journalists and researchers and the legislation preventing the family from benefiting from it all.COMMENTSI was gifted this book in December but never realized the impact it had internationally, neither would have on me. Until I finished reading it last night, I did not know it was an international bestseller, as well as read by so many of my GR friends! It was total surprise, since nonfiction is normally not a regular star on bestseller lists, right?The debate around the moral issue, and the experiences of the poor family were very well presented in the book, which was truly well written and objective as far as possible. For me personally, the question of how this woman, who basically saved millions of people's lives, were overlooked, is answered in the arrogance of scientists who deemed it unnecessary to respect the rights of people unable to fend for themselves.The ethical and moral dilemmas it created in America, when the family became aware of their mother's contribution to science without anyone's knowledge or consent, just enabled the commercial enterprises who benefited massively from her cells, to move to other countries where human rights are just a faint star in a unlimited universe. The Lacks family drew a line in the sand of how far people must be exploited in America. Unfortunately the medical fraternity just moved their operations elsewhere.Tissue and organ harvesting thrive in the world, it is globally a massive industry, with the poorest of the poor still the uninformed donors. An open secret. There are numerous stories, especially in India, where people wake up and realize they were operated on and one of their organs is missing. Stolen. By the time they became aware of it, the organ had already been transplanted in America and elsewhere in the world. That's no secret. Everything is justified as long as science is involved.  Nowadays people in other parts of the world sell their organs, even though it is illegal in most countries. According to American laws people cannot sell their tissue, which is part of human organs? People can donate it though, then it is acceptable.Yet someone else can patent your cells, but you're not allowed to be compensated, since the minute it leaves your body, it is regarded as waste, disposed of, and therefor not deemed your 'property' anymore. Huh?This book was a good and necessary read. The human interest side of it, telling the story of the family was eye-opening and excellent. A little bit of melodramatic, but how else would it become a bestseller, if ordinary readers like us could not relate to it. It was very well-written indeed. Thanks to Rebecca Skloot, in 2010, sixty years later, HeLa now has a history, a face and an address. Finally, Henrietta Lacks, and not the anonymous HeLa, became a biological celebrity. In 1951 Dr. Grey's lab assistant handled yet just another tissue sample of hundreds, when she received Henrietta's to prepare for research. She named it HeLa(first two letters of the patient's name and last name). But a few months later she visited the body of the deceased Henrietta Lacks in the mortuary to collect more samples. When she saw the woman's red-painted toenails, a lightbulb went on.Mary Kubicek: “Oh jeez, she’s a real person. . . . I started imagining her sitting in her bathroom painting those toenails, and it hit me for the first time that those cells we’d been working with all this time and sending all over the world, they came from a live woman. I’d never thought of it that way.”John Hopkins hospital could have considered naming a wing of their research facilities after Henrietta Lack. Why don't they?Nevertheless, this book should be read by everybody. Without it the world would have been a lot poorer and less human.The world has a lot to answer for.RECOMMENDED for sure!EDIT I googled the Lacks family and landed upon the website of the Lacks Foundation, which was started by Rebecca Skloot. http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/That news TOTALLY made my day. I wish them all the best and hope they will succeed in their goals and dreams. A wonderful initiative. Just imagine what can be accomplished if every single person, organization, research facility and medical company who benefitted for Henrietta Lacks's tissue cells, donate only $1 (one single dollar)? Yes, just imagine that!So many positive things happened to the family after the book was published.

16,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,5,"There are some books that I finish and am left in awe, questioning everything that I thought I knew on a subject. Or, as is the case hear, having learned so much about which I knew nothing. My jaw is still on the floor after I finished this book and I can only imagine the controversies and discussions it might provoke. A thank you goes out to three Goodreads friends who recommended that I read this book and open an avenue for discussion. Aven, Brenda, and Rae, I hope we can begin a wild and intriguing dialogue, pulling others into the mix as things gain momentum.Who was Henrietta Lacks? What are HeLa cells? These are two of the foundational questions that Rebecca Skloot sought to answer in this poignant biographical piece. While I have tackled a number of biographies in my time as a reader, Skloot offered a unique approach to the genre in publication. Henrietta Lacks grew up in rural Virginia, picking tobacco and made ends meet as best she could. After marrying, she had a brood of children, including two of note, Elsie and Deborah, whose significance becomes apparent as the reader delves deeper into the narrative. Skloot offered up a succinct, but detailed narrative of how Lacks found an unusual mass inside her and was sent from her doctor to a specialist at Johns Hopkins (yes, THAT medical centre) for treatment. The mass was malignant and Lacks was deemed to have cervical cancer. Her surgeon, following the precedent of many doctors in the early 1950s, took samples of her tumour as well as that of the healthy part of her cervix, hoping to be able to have the cells survive so they could be analysed. Past attempts by doctors and scientists failed to keep cells alive for very long, which led to the constant slicing and saving technique used by those in the medical profession, when the opportunity arose. As it turns out, Lacks' cells were not only fascinating to explore, but George Gey (Head of Tissue Culture Research at Johns Hopkins) noticed that they lasted indefinitely, as long as they were properly fed. Gey realised that he had something on his hands and tried to get approval from the Lacks family, though did so in an extremely opaque manner. After Lacks succumbed to the cancer, doctors sought to perform an autopsy, which might allow them complete access to Lacks' body. Ignorant of what was going on, Henrietta's husband agreed, thinking that this was only to ensure his children and subsequent generations would not suffer the agony that cancer brought upon Henrietta. So began the conniving and secretive nature of George Gey. He harvested these 'special cells' and named them ""HeLa"", a brief combination of the original patient's two names. Their phenomenal growth and sustainability led him to ship them all over the country and eventually the world, though the Lacks family had no idea this was going on. HeLa cells were studied to create a polio vaccine (Jonas Salk used them at the University of Pittsburgh), helped to better understand cellular reactions to nuclear testing, space travel, and introduction of cancer cells into an otherwise healthy body during curious and somewhat inhumane tests on Ohio inmates. During all this, Johns Hopkins remained completely aware of what was going on and the transmission of HeLa cells around the globe, though did not think to inform the Lacks family, perhaps for fear that they would halt the use of these HeLa cells. Through the use of the term 'HeLa' cells, no one was the wiser and no direct acknowledgement of the long-deceased Henrietta Lacks need be made. Skloot provided much discussion about the uses, selling, 'donating', and experimenting that took place, including segments of the scientific community in America that were knowingly in violation of the Nuremberg Rules on human experimentation, though they danced their own legal jig to get around it all. The crux of the biography lay on this conundrum, though it would only find its true impact by exploring the lives of those Henrietta Lacks left behind after her death.Skloot took the time to pepper chapters with the history of the Lacks family as they grew up and, eventually, what happened when they were made aware that the HeLa cells existed, over two decades after they were obtained and Henrietta had died. Skloot split this other biographical piece into two parts, which eventually merge into one, documenting her research trips and interviews with the family alongside the presentation of a narrative that explores the fruits of those sit-down interviews. That Skloot tried to remain somewhat neutral is apparent, though through her connection to Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah, there was an obvious bias that developed. Superimposing these two narratives would, hopefully, offer the reader a chance to feel a personal connection to the Lacks family and the struggles they went through. In her discussions of the Lacks family, Skloot pulled no punches and presented the raw truths of criminal activity, abuse, addiction, and poverty alongside happy gatherings and memories of Henrietta. No biographical piece would be complete if it were only window dressing and trying to paint a rosy picture of this maligned family without offering at least a little peek into their daily lives. However, it balanced out and Skloot ended up with what the reader might call a decent introduction to this run of the mill family unit. Their ire at being duped by Johns Hopkins was apparent, alongside the dichotomy that HeLa cells were so popular, yet the family remained in dire poverty in the poor areas of Baltimore.The legal ramifications of HeLa cell usage was discussed at various points in the book, though there was no firm case related to it, at least not one including the Lacks family. One person I know sought to draw parallels between the Lacks situation and that of Carrie Buck, as illustrated wonderfully in Adam Cohen's book, Imbeciles (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...). While the courts surely fell short in codifying ownership of cells and research done on them, the focus of Skloot's book was the social injustice by Johns Hopkins, not the ineptitude of the US Supreme Court, as Cohen showed while presenting Buck v. Bell to the curious audience. While George Gey vowed that he gave away the HeLa cell samples to anyone who wanted them, surely the chain reaction and selling of them in catalogues thereafter allowed someone to line their pockets. Skloot offers up numerous mentions from the family, usually through Deborah, that the Lacks family was not seeking to get rich off of this discovery of immortal cells. While companies were spending millions and profiting billions from the early testing of HeLa cells, no one in the family could afford to see a doctor or purchase the medicines they needed (all of which came about because of tests HeLa cells facilitated!). It is both fascinating and angering to see the system wash their hands of the guilt related to immoral collecting and culturing of these HeLa cells. Skloot did explore the slippery slope of cells and tissue as discarded waste, as well as the need for consent in testing them, something the reader ought to spend some time exploring once the biographical narrative ends. It is sure to confound and confuse even the most well-grounded reader.The latter chapters touched upon the aptly used word from the title ""Immortal"" as it relates to Henrietta Lacks. Be it a biography that placed a story behind the woman, a detailed discussion of how the HeLa cell came into being and how its presence is all over the medical world, or that medical advancements as we know them will allow Henrietta Lacks' being to live on for eternity, the reader can reflect on which rationale best suits them. While there is a religious undertone in the biography as it relates to this, Christianity is not inculcated into the reader's mind, as it was not when Skloot learned about these things.Do I know Henrietta Lacks any better now, after Skloot completed her work? Most definitely! Can I, a complete scientific dunce, better understand HeLa cells and the idea behind cell growth and development? Completely! Do I feel there was an injustice done to the Lacks family by Johns Hopkins in 1951 and for decades to come? Yes, I do harbour a strong resentment to the duplicitous attitude undertaken by a hospital whose founder sought to ensure those who could not receive medical care on their own be helped and protected. Is there a lingering legal argument to be made for compensatory damages or at least some fiduciary responsibility owed to the Lacks family? That is a very grey area for me, only further complicated by the legal discussions in the Afterward and the advancement of new and complicated scientific discoveries, which also bore convoluted legal arguments. I will say this... Skloot brought Henrietta Lacks to life and if that puts a face to those HeLa cells, perhaps all those who read this book will think twice about those medicines used in their bodies and the scientific breakthroughs that are attributed to many powerful companies and/or nations. Maybe then, Henrietta can live on in all of us, immortal in some form or another.Kudos, Madam Skloot for intriguing someone whose scientific background is almost nil. You brought numerous stories to life and helped me see just how powerful one woman can be, silenced by death and the ignorance of what those around her were doing.Like/hate the review?

17,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol,4,"This 2010 work of non-fiction regarding THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS is a sad story and a tough, draining read that shocked me more than once along the way.Henrietta was a poor black woman only 31 years of age when she died of cervical cancer leaving five children behind, her youngest, Deborah, just a baby. Her story is a heartbreaking one, but also an important one as her cancer cells, forever to be known as HeLa taken without her consent or knowledge, saved thousands of lives.Through ten long years of investigative work by this author, this narrative explores the experimental, racial and ethical issues of HeLa (the cells that would not die), while intertwining the story of her children's lives and the utter shock of finding out about their mother's cells more than twenty years later.""Physician Seeks Volunteers For Cancer Research."" Yeah, right........So many parts of this book made me sick to my stomach.....like the uncaring treatment of animals and all the poor souls injected with cancer cells without their knowledge in the name of research and greed; and oh, dam Ethel for the inhumane and brutal abuse to Henrietta's children too. Unbelievable!Whew! I must admit to being glad when I turned the last page on this one, but big time kudos to Rebecca Skloot for researching and telling Henrietta's story. She deserved so much better."
18,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,4,"Overall, a four star read that should probably be required reading for both biology and American history classes. (Actually, it was a far more interesting read than that makes it sound). While I had heard a great deal of buzz on the book, I wasn't prepared for how the story evolved. The book alternates between Henrietta Lacks' personal history, that of her family, a little of medical history and Skoot's actual pursuit of the story, which helps develop the story in historical context. Skoots included a lot more science than I expected, and even with ten years in the medical field, I was horrified at times. Skoots does a decent job of maintaining a journalistic tone, but some of the things she relates are terrible, from the way Henrietta grew up to cervical cancer treatment in the 50s and 60s. These were the days before cancer treatments approached the precision medicine it is aiming for today, and the treatments resembled nothing so much as trying to cut fingernails with garden shears. Just the thought of a radioactive seed tucked in the uterus causing tissue burn was enough to give me sympathetic cramps.Part of the evil in the book is the violence her family inflicted on each other, and it's one of the truly uncomfortable areas. I think that discomfort is important, because part of where this story comes from has to do with slavery and poverty. There isn't really an ethical high ground here, and that's part of Skoot's skill in setting up the story, and part of the problem in being a white woman telling the story of a black woman. The only reason I didn't give this a five star rating is that the narrative started to fall apart at the end, leaving behind the stories of the cell line and focus more on the breakdown of Henrietta's daughter, Deborah. While I understand she is the touchstone for the story, that she is partly telling the story of the mother through the daughter, much of Henrietta and the science is sidelined.Interesting questions popped up while reading; namely, why does everyone equate Henrietta's cancer cells with her person? As an illustration, if you tell people they have a cancerous tumor, the reaction is ""get rid of it."" It is categorized as ""other"" in everyone's mind and not recognized it as an intrinsic part of the person with cancer. It is not ""them."" Biologically speaking, I'm not sure the book answered the question of whether of not the HeLa cells actually were genetically identical to Henrietta, or if they were mutated--altered DNA. While that might be cold comfort, it's a huge philosophical and scientific question that is the pivot point for a number of issues. Treating the cells as if they were ""normal"" is part of what lead the scientists into disaster as evidenced by the discovery that so many cell lines were HeLa contaminated (I don't believe that transmission mechanism was explained either, which irks me). It also could be the basis for a sophisticated legal and ethical argument."

Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead in 1951. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سی و یکم ماه آگوست سال 2014 میلادیعنوان: حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس؛ نویسنده: ربکا اسکلاوت (اسکلوت)؛ مترجم: حسین راسی؛ تهران آرامش‏‫، 1390؛ در 426ص؛ شابک 9789649219165؛ موضوع: هنرییتا لکس از سال 1920م تا 1951م؛ بیماران و سرطان - اخلاق پزشکی - کشت یاخته ها - آزمایش روی انسان - سده 21م‬زندگینامه ی بیماری به نام «هنرییتا لکس» است، نامش «هنریتا لکس» بود، اما دانشمندان ایشان را با نام «هلا» میشناسند؛ یک کشاورز تنباکوی فقیر جنوب بود، که در همان سرزمین اجداد برده ی خود، کار میکردند، اما سلولهایش - که بدون آگاهی ایشان گرفته شده - به یکی از مهمترین ابزارهای پزشکی تبدیل شد؛ نخستین سلولهای «جاودانه»ی انسانی که، رشد یافته اند، و امروز هنوز هم زنده هستند، اگرچه ایشان در سال 1951میلادی درگذشته اند؛ اگر بتوانیم همه ی سلولهای «هلا» را که تکثیر شده اند، وزن کنیم، شاید وزن آنها به بیش از پنجاه میلیون تن برسد؛ سلولهای «هلا» برای ایجاد «واکسن فلج اطفال» حیاتی بودند؛ سلولهای ایشان، پرده از اسرار «سرطان»، «ویروسها» و اثرات «تشعشعات بمب اتم»؛ برداشتند؛ همچنین پیشرفتهایی همانند: «لقاح آزمایشگاهی»، «کلونینگ» و «نقشه برداری ژن»، یاری کرده است؛ و توسط میلیاردها انسان خریداری و فروخته شده اند؛ با اینحال «هنریتتا لکس» ناشناخته مانده، و در یک گور نامشخص دفن شده استاین کتاب به بخش‌های: برخورد اخلاق در حرفه پزشکی با نژادپرستی، و محرومیت‌های «تاریخی- اجتماعی» رنگین پوستان، برخورد جنبه‌ های معنوی، و حقوقی مالکیت بافت‌های بدن انسان، به تنگدستی و خرافات‌، و برخورد با اکتشاف‌ها، راهکارها، و شیوه ‌های نوین پزشکی هم پرداخته، و نکاتی خواندنی را پیش روی خوانشگر میگذارد؛ «حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس»: صحبت‌ها، یادمانهای نزدیکان «لکس»، و نگاهی به اسناد قانونی، و پرونده‌های پزشکی ایشان نیز هست؛ نگارنده، در این نوشتار علاوه بر نگارش تاریخچة زندگی «هنریتیا لکس» به معرفی «سلول‌های هیلا» و پاسخ‌گویی به پرسش‌‌هایی درباره ی دانش پزشکی، اخلاق، نژاد، و طبقه‌ بندی اجتماعی نیز، پرداخته استا. شربیانی"
20,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6050722-rachel,5,"Full disclosure: I come to this book from a weirdly fortuitous place. Take my brief, but mind-searing, stint in gynecologic oncology research ca. 2002, which involved a weekly trek to the OR to pick up still-warm tumors, with the women who informedly consented to donate them often open on the table as I did so. Then throw in two years working in a tissue culture hood, two more in a narrative nonfiction book group, and another big chunk of time studying infectious diseases. Mix in interests in social justice, bioethics, the history of science, and mysteries, and you’ve got me primed for some outsized adoration of Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, because its three main narratives are: 1) The history of tissue culture, particularly the contribution of the “immortal,” fabulously prolific HeLa cells that revolutionized medical research.2) The life, disease and death of Henrietta Lacks, the woman whose cervical cancer cells gave rise to the HeLa cell line.3) The story of Henrietta Lacks’s impoverished family, particularly her daughter Deborah, belatedly discovering and coping with their mother’s cellular legacy.Intertwined with all three is the concept of informed consent in scientific research, and who owns those bits of us and our genetic information that are floating around the research world. See? That perfect scientific/bioethical/historical mystery doesn’t come along every day. My expectations for this one were absolutely sky-high. And Rebecca Skloot hit it higher than that pile of 89 zillion HeLa cells. Thing is, my particular background can make reading about science kind of painfully bifurcated. I mean first, you’ve got your books that are all, “Yay! Science is totally objective and awesome and will solve all of our problems, so just shut up and trust it already!!” But then you’ve definitely also got your, “Science is just one (over-privileged and socially influenced) way of knowing among many / Medicine is patriarchal and wicked and economically motivated and pretty much out to get you, so avoid it at all costs” books too.Yes, Skloot could have written the story of a poor, black, female victim of evil white scientists. But she didn’t do that. Given her interests, it’s conceivable she could have written the triumphant history of tissue culture, and the amazing medical breakthroughs made possible by HeLa cells, and thank you for playing, poorblackwomanwhomnobodyknows. But she didn’t do that either. Instead, she spent ten years researching and writing a balanced, multifaceted book about the humans doing the science, the human whose cells made the science possible, and the humans profoundly affected by the actions of both. Her book is a complex tangle of race, class, gender and medicine. Of reason and faith. Of knowledge and ethics. Of the chasm between the beneficiaries of medical innovation and those without healthcare in the good old US of A.And Skloot doesn’t have the answers. We don’t get to tut-tut at how much things sucked in the past, while patting ourselves on the back for living in the enlightened present. This is vital and messy stuff, here. The problems haven’t been fixed. Who owns our pieces is an issue that is very much alive, and, with the current onslaught of new genetic information, becoming livelier by the minute. Which is why I would feel comfortable recommending this book to anyone involved in human-subjects research in any capacity...so a boatload of us, really, whether we know it or not.But, buyer beware: to tackle all this three-pronged complexity, Skloot uses a decidedly non-linear structure, one with a high narrative leaps:book length ratio. The three main narratives unfold together and inform each other: we meet Deborah Lacks, while learning about the fate of her mother, while learning about what HeLa cells can do, while learning about tissue culture innovators, while learning about the fate of Deborah Lacks. And Skloot saves the nuts and bolts of informed consent and the ownership of biological materials for a densely packed Afterward. Me, I found this to be a powerful structure and ate it all up with a spoon, but I can see how it could be a bit frustrating. You should also know that Skloot is in the book. According to Skloot herself, she fought against this for years. But you know what? I think she needs to be there. This is a book about adding the human complexity back into an illusion of objective scientific truth. When the author has become a character in the lives of her subjects, influencing events in their lives, it works to have the author be a textual presence disrupting the illusion of the objective journalistic truth. She only appears when it’s relevant to her subjects’ story; you don’t hear anything about her story that doesn’t pertain to theirs. And having been in that narrative nonfiction book group for two years, Skloot’s stands out as an elegant and thoughtful approach to the author/subject connection (self-reported femme-fatale author of The Angel of Grozny: Orphans of a Forgotten War, I’m looking at you so hard right now.)
This book pairs well with:
 The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures, another excellent, non-judgmental book about the intersection of science, medicine and culture. With The Mismeasure of Man, for more on the fallibility of the scientific process. It would also taste really good with a kick-ass book about the history of biomedical ethics in the United States, so if you know of one, I’d love to hear about it!"
21,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"I am late to this book party, but let me explain: I get twitchy about medical stuff. Earlier this year I had to abandon Rosemary Mahoney's book about the blind because it described an eye surgery. I have never been able to finish Dr. Atul Gawande's Complications because of its description of medical procedures. It was a small miracle that I was able to finish the Call the Midwife series, because I hate childbirth scenes. When this Henrietta Lacks book started tearing up the bestseller lists a few years ago, I read a few reviews and thought, ""Yeah, that can wait.""Then I started a new library job, and the Lacks book was chosen as a Common Read for the campus. Guess who was volun-told to help lead upcoming book discussions? (Hint: it was me.)So, with a deep sigh, I started reading. And then, oh happy day, my fears turned out to be unfounded because I ended up really liking the story. Rebecca Skloot wrote that she first heard about Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells in a community college biology class. Lacks was a black woman who died in 1951 from cervical cancer. Before she died, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. A key part of this story is that Henrietta did not know her tissue had been taken, and doctors did not tell her family.Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in culture for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal cells ever grown in a laboratory.Henrietta's cells, nicknamed HeLa, were given to scientists and researchers around the world, and they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, Parkinson's disease, and they helped with innumerable other medical studies over the decades. At first, the cells were given for free, but some companies were set up to sell vials of HeLa, which became a lucrative enterprise. The reason Henrietta's cells were so precious was because they allowed scientists to perform experiments that would have been impossible with a living human. They cut HeLa cells apart and exposed them to endless toxins, radiation, and infections. They bombarded them with drugs, hoping to find one that would kill malignant cells without destroying normal ones. They studied immune suppression and cancer growth by injecting HeLa cells into immune-compromise rats, which developed malignant tumors much like Henrietta's. If the cells died in the process, it didn't matter -- scientists could just go back to their eternally growing HeLa stock and start over again.Unfortunately, the Lacks family did not know about any of this until several decades after Henrietta had died, and some relatives became very upset and felt betrayed by the doctors at Hopkins. A few threatened to sue the hospital, but never did.There is a lot of biology and medical discussion in this book, but Skloot also tried to learn more about Henrietta's life, and she was able to interview Lacks' relatives and children. Additionally, there is some good discussion on the ethics of taking tissue samples from patients without their consent, and on the problem of racism in health care.""I always have thought it was strange, if our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can't afford to see no doctors? Don't make no sense. People got rich off my mother without us even known about them takin her cells now we don't get a dime. I used to get so mad about that to where it made me sick and I had to take pills. But I don't got it in me no more to fight. I just want to know who my mother was."" -- Deborath Lacks, who was very young when her mother diedMy favorite parts of the book were the stories about Henrietta and the Lacks family, and the discussions on race and ethics in health care. There's no indication that Henrietta questioned [her doctor]; like most patients in the 1950s, she deferred to anything her doctors said. This was a time when 'benevolent deception' was a common practice -- doctors often withheld even the most fundamental information from their patients, sometimes not giving them any diagnosis at all. They believed it was best not to confuse or upset patients with frightening terms they might not understand, like cancer. Doctors knew best, and most patients didn't question that. Especially black patients in public wards. This was 1951 in Baltimore, segregation was law, and it was understood that black people didn't question white people's professional judgment. Many black patients were just glad to be getting treatment, since discrimination in hospitals was widespread.Skloot worked on the book for more than a decade, paying for research trips with student loans and credit card debt. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in medical ethics, biology, or just some good investigative reporting. Favorite Quote""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different."" -- Deborah Lacks"
22,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61753513-christy,5,"I do believe this book must have scored near the top of all books used in college courses these last 5-6 years - from English to history and social sciences, but I wonder how much traction it got in medical school and across the healthcare and medical research fields. It quickly became a ""classic"" because so many issues are covered: race, class, gender, genetics, property rights, and about the social ends of science and our technological choices. As well, it's a story of how some people are used by institutions for other ends, whether admirably or not, and how unjust and unfair it was to Henrietta to have her cancer cells taken without her permission. She died at age 31 from the cancer, yet the gene treatment her cells produced is tremendously useful in the medical field and will be for a long time to come, hence her ""immortal"" status, yet it gives little comfort to the reader. Ironically, her own family now suffers from a lack of access to healthcare.Kudos to author Skloot who started a the Henrietta Lacks Foundation to help families like the Lacks with healthcare and other financial needs, including more victims of similar experiences, including those of the infamous Tuskeegee experiment with treating only some Black soldiers with syphilis. You can check it out at http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/"
23,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020736-stacey,5,"I've started and erased my little book commentary so many times because this story is so overwhelming and so important on multiple levels, I'm not sure anything I could say about it would do justice to the complexity and dichotomy of the story surrounding Henrietta Lacks. It might not be far from the truth to state that she was the most important person who ever lived. A physical part of her body has saved hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of lives, and improved the lives of countless others. And her story is not over yet. Her cells are still being used in medical research all over the world. But these benefits came at the cost of a violation of her rights, in a time when it was commonplace for doctors and researchers to just do and take, without consent, especially among poor populations and people of color. Some of the things done with Henrietta's cells saved lives, some were heinous experiments performed on people who had no idea what was being done to them, in a grotesquely distorted and amplified reflection of what was done to Henrietta. Nuremberg was dismissed in the United States as something that only applied to the fallen Nazi's. Any act was justifiable in the name of science. And yet, some of the things done right her in our own nation were reminiscent of the research being conducted under the direction of the notorious Dr. Mengele.Reading certain parts of this book, I found myself holding my breath in horror at some of the ideas conjured by medical practioners in the name of “research.” Of course, we know.* Anyone who is even moderately informed on this nation's medical history knows about the Tuskegee trials, MK Ultra, flu and hepatitis research on the disabled and incarcerated, radiation exposure experiments on hospital patients, and cancer, cancer, cancer. The poor, disabled and people of color in this country, the “land of the free,” have been subjected to so many cancer experiments, it defies belief. Many of these trials, including some devised of Henrietta's cells, have involved injecting cancer, non-consensually, into human subjects. So while it is true that there can be utterly no doubt that our lives, and the lives of much of the world, are better, because of the knowledge made possible by parts of Henrietta Lacks's body, still acknowledgment of this reality comes at the cost of knowing that procedures were performed on her without her knowledge or understanding, and without her consent, with impunity; these actions were made even easier because she was poor, black and female, and this is to say nothing of the numerous and unethical violations of her (and her children's) privacy. It's an old story. It's a story that her biographer, Rebecca Skloot, handles with grace and compassion. Henrietta is not some medical spectacle, she was a real woman. If she has been deified by her friends and family since her death, it is maybe the homage that she deserves, not for her cells, but for her vibrance, kindness, and the tragedy of a mother who died much too young. There are a great many scientific and historical facts presented in this book, facts that I couldn't possibly vet for veracity, but the science seems sound, if simplistic, and the history is presented in a conversational way, that is easy to read, and uninterrupted by footnotes and references. Family recollections are presented in storyteller fashion, which makes for easy and compelling reading. Fact-checking is made easy by a list of references, presented in chapter-by-chapter appendices. Rarely do I read something that makes me want to collar strangers in the street and tell them, “You MUST read this book,” but this is one of those times. Henrietta's story is bigger than medical research, and cures for polio, and the human genome, and Nuremberg. Henrietta's story is about basic human rights, and autonomy, and love. It's about knowledge and power, how it's human nature to find a way to justify even the worst things we can devise in the name of the greater good, and how we turn our science into a god. This story is bigger than Rebecca Skloot's book. But I am grateful that she wrote it, and thankful to have read it. Would the story have changed had Henrietta been given the opportunity to give her informed consent? That's the thread of mystery which runs through the entire story, the answer to which we can never know. *documentation in this list is inconsistent, but most of these experiments can be independently verified."

25,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,4,"A lot to process with this book. This book's been out for a while, so I'm just going to put down a bunch of thoughts rattling around in my head, and probably leave it at that:-legacy left by slavery and how it affected Henrietta Lacks and the members of her family, and African Americans in general (where they lived, what kind of employment was available to them, the quality of education available to them, the history of abuse and violence, and the impact on their mental health, and the quality and availability of healthcare)-the assumptions and treatment by the medical establishment, at the time, of their patients and patients' rights-the lack of laws, or their lack of clarity, around a patient's consent, and the ownership of a patient's waste products from medical procedures. This was well illustrated in this book, from the 1950s to the time of the book's publication. -the quality of scientific education and knowledge in the general public. Unless people have some understanding of science, how are they to know what questions to ask of their doctors? The more affluent will generally fare better here, I suspect, what with their access to probably better trained teachers, and the ability to get higher education. And affluence and better outcomes would be partially dependent on where one started out in life.-thank goodness medical procedures improve over time, or are retired in favour of treatments that work!!-bioethics--thank goodness there is debate and evolution of ideas and laws. Though there are probably still lots of grey areas around research and commercializations -I was interested to find out more about the point raised about the DNA of the cell descendants of Henrietta's original cancerous cells.-I was sickened by the treatment, or perhaps I should say mystery around the treatment of Elsie, Henrietta's eldest daughter at the hospital for the insane. Or what doctors could call insane at the time.This was a painful read, but an important accounting of a part of US history, and more specifically, the legacy of slavery on a family, and the changing attitudes and practices in medicine and science."
26,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"I am not sure how is it in other countries but here in the Philippines, if you bring your car for repair in a service center and the serviceman says that he replaced a part, you how to do in you should find that replaced part inside your car. I think it is their proof that they actually replaced that part and also for you to decide how you want to dispose, resell, reuse or recycle it. Normally, this practice bothers me because I have a very small space for junks at home and I do not know what to do with a malfunctioning compressor, air vent, axle, mudguard, leaking pipes, tubes, coolant container, etc. What am I going to do with them? The only thing I know w.r.t. car is how to replace the battery or a flat tire. So, I always end up giving those away to the poor junk man so as to have something to load in his pushcart.It may not be the best analogy to introduce a very compelling book like this. However, the logic is the same. The organ, tissue, cells or fluids that you left in the hospital during your last hospitalization or check-up is totally different from the car spare parts. But both are left after you get what you want and you think they are of no use to you anymore. You gave the authorization for the part to be removed and replaced (if possible) and you deserve to have the replaced unit because legally, you are still the owner of the original or replaced part. However, just like me and the car junks, I would imagine that you don't want to bring home with you some test tubes filled with your excess coagulated blood, liquified Chlorox-smelling semen, miniscule torn ligaments or decayed tooth. What are you going to do with them? Henrietta Lacks, a poor black Tobacco farmer, died of cervical cancer in 1951. Without her knowledge, the doctors got her cancerous tissue and tried to use its cells in a cell culture. Surprise. Surprise. Henrietta's cells propagate like wild fire and they are still alive up to now. It was the first successful cell culture since in all the previous attempts, the cells only lived for few days before dying. The book explains that in Henrietta's chromosomes has enzyme called telomerase that continuously rebuils the telomere which is a string of DNA found at the end of each of Henrietta's chromosome. Skloot says in her introduction that there is more to this, as well as other issues, but apologizes for not excluding them in this book's scope. That's fine with me, because the scientific discussions in the book are just enough for me not to fall asleep and lose interest. We all took Biology in high school and the Cell and its parts, how they work, etc is always that's subject's first lesson so I think you can get by.So what if Henrietta's cells are still alive today? Medical discoveries still happen and we don't know or don't care to know their history. Well, those cells have been used to developed vaccines for polio, gene mapping, cloning, etc. So? Well, Henrietta's cancer cells were used without her or her families consent. Henrietta died 2 weeks after being diagnosed with cervical cancer and she was so poor she had to be buried in an unmarked grave. So? Well, Henrietta was black and the doctors were white. In the 50's, America was still not so open with mixing the two colors. The whites probably would not want to have anything in their body taken from a black person. So? This book tackles a number of controversial questions on medical ethics, racism and social discrimination. However, this is not a serious boring book. Skloot's storytelling does not leave any tinge of textbook formality and this can be read just like any A-grade medical crime bestseller that has some sprinklings of family drama (Henrietta's children have to be given away to relatives after her death), incest (10-y/o Rebecca, Henrietta's daughter, escapes a horny uncle showing his erect penis and she does not know the meaning of a rigid penis) and the struggles of a black family despite having a world-renowned mother whose cells, called the HeLa cells, make a unprecedented contribution to the medical field and in prolonging our life expectancy.So? Well, what if the same thing happens to you? What are the chances that your excess semen was not put in the wastebasket but stored in a sperm bank and given away to childless couples for in vitro fertilization of the wife's ovum? Then what if that child becomes the new Einstein? a new Picasso? a new Shakespeare? a new G.G.Marquez? I'm just saying...  "
27,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3893454-christina,4,"This was an interesting read. While I applaud Skloot's attempt to present a fair look at the history of the HeLa cell line used in research labs all over the world, the book is clearly skewed toward sympathy for the family. Not that they don't deserve sympathy, but really, the problems of the family is NOT the fault of anyone involved with the cell line. Don't get me wrong, Henrietta and her family have had a hard life, and they do deserve some sympathy. But not for this particular issue.The sad fact is that Henrietta died of an aggressive cancer, leaving her family to live their lives without her. That was not her fault or the fault of her family, but it was also not the fault of the hospital staff of Johns Hopkins. Yes, there was racial and socio-economic discrimination, but the fact remains that Henrietta was treated to best of the ability of the doctors at that time. Do we view the taking of cell samples from Henrietta without her permission as unethical today? Most people would say yes. But the law still remains unclear about that, and in 1954 that was most certainly not seen as unethical - it was common practice. So in the context of the time, the act was not unethical. As for monetary compensation, Johns Hopkins did not profit from the growth of HeLa cells; in fact, the scientist that first worked with HeLa cells GAVE the cells away to many many many other labs FOR FREE. Those labs shared with other labs, etc. Are there companies that profit from the cells now? Yes. But they got the cells the same way everyone else did back then - for free. The company then did their own research to find a way to mass produce, store and ship living cells. At the point the first company started mass producing and selling the cells the identity of the donor was long hidden, and the fact the cells were widespread at that time made them common property, so people in possession of the cells could do pretty much anything they wanted with them. And now for the part that is a little stickier - the family found out about Henrietta's cells, were (sort of) tricked into donating blood and cell samples and were kept in the dark about the cell line for decades. Was that right? NO, absolutely not. HOWEVER, I will point out that some of the subsequent anger, confusion and fear on the part of the family was due to their extreme lack of education rather than a malicious attempt to prey upon the Lacks family. The science presented in the book is simplified somewhat for the lay person, which is nice, as is the look at the advances in medicine and research that HeLa cells have brought to the world. As a scientist, however, I think that Skloot's explanations were a little fuzzy and did not really dispel most people's image of how science works in the real world. Perhaps a little more objectivity and less family bonding would have made this a better book.In conclusion: though Skloot claims she tries to give an unbiased view of the history of HeLa cells and the family from whence it came, I am concerned that lay people who read this will not understand some of the finer points and it will increase the already rampant fear of science that pervades American culture. The majority of Americans are woefully un-educated in the sciences, to the point that many people view it as no different than magic,but weirder and scarier. "

And the way she told Henrietta's story was beautiful and almost reflective of Henrietta's life. The story started at a point and then spread out to become a story that enveloped all of humanity. I read this as more research on Henrietta for my forthcoming novel THE BOOK OF PHOENIX and it was exactly what I needed and wanted. I wanted the science but I also wanted the close personal narrative of this woman and the people in her life; I wanted the good, the bad and the ugly. This book was all of that. Some of it is lovely, some was disturbing, plenty of it as shocking, and lots of it was heart-breaking. Her story is so deeplyAmerican. Also, it was really cool how close the writer got to the narrative. and eventually became a part of it. I love that. Oh and there's a touch of African magic in the story, which didn't surprise me at ALL, considering what this book was about. <3'd this book!"
29,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer,4,"You know all those forms you have to fill out while waiting at the doctor and dentist office? The tedious, repetitious ones that you could have sworn you already completed at least a thousand times? Next time you sigh loudly or roll your eyes at the prospect of this task, think about the people who came before us who were never offered the luxury of informed consent, confidentiality, and protection from discrimination. Horrendous injustices prompted these forms into action so that history does not repeat itself. It's a sad thought.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks offers historical insight into human rights issues within the medical field. Primarily though, it focuses on the woman behind the most famous and widely researched human cells in the world: Henrietta Lacks. Her name has only recently become known to the world which is quite sad, but thanks to her family's perseverance and Rebecca Skloot's heavy research and publication, the world now knows who to credit with most medical advances to date. It has been reported that Ms. Lacks had no knowledge of her contribution, as she was unaware that tissues were saved after multiple cancer biopsies/treatments, and therefore, she gave no permission for her cells to be used in any way, shape, or form, but Ms. Skloot reminds us that even today, none of us have any say over what is done with our cells and tissues once removed from our bodies. I appreciated Ms. Skloot's attention to Ms. Lacks' remaining family members and their immense struggles in spite of all the progress (and profits) made in the medical field. In my opinion though, she was a bit too forthcoming in regards to the family. Factors related to race, poverty, education, medical issues, disabilities, and access to healthcare are definitely warranted in a book like this to show the overall contrast between those benefiting from Ms. Lacks' contribution and the family that was left behind, along with the insensitivity and injustice of it all. However, criminal histories, superstitions, and mental illness had no place in this book in my opinion. I believe this was potentially harmful to the family's character, and some portions of the book painted the family in a money-hungry and incompetent light which was unnecessary even if that may have been Ms. Skloot's perception or experience. Regardless, the family's inclusion in this book did make all the difference and I thoroughly enjoyed my reading experience.

He started shaking my hand and wormed his way into the house.“Mr. Kemper, I’m John Doe with Dee-Bag Industries Incorporated. I need you to sign some paperwork and take a ride with me. Don’t worry, I’ll have you home in a day or two,” he said. Then he pulled a document out of his briefcase, set it on the coffee table and pushed a pen in my hand. “Wait a second. What the hell is this all about?” I said as I tried to pick up the paper to read it, but Doe kept trying to force my hand with the pen down on it so I couldn‘t see what it said.“Oh, that’s just legal mumbo-jumbo. You’d rather try and read your mortgage agreement than this old thing. Just put your name down and let’s be on our way, shall we?” he said.There was a brief scuffle, but I managed to distract him by messing up his carefully gelled hair. As he shrieked and ran around looking for a mirror, I finally got to read the document.“This is a medical consent form. What’s going on?” I demanded as I shook the paper at him. Once he had combed and smoothed his hair back into perfection, Doe sighed.“Very well, Mr. Kemper. I guess I’ll have to come clean. Do you remember when you had your appendix out when you were in grade school?”“Sure. That gave me one of my better scars, but that was like 30 years ago. Why are you here now?” I asked.“You’re probably not aware of this, but your appendix was used in a research project by DBII,” Doe said.“Really? I assumed it just got incinerated or used in the hospital cafeteria’s meatloaf special. Why would anyone want to study my rotten appendix?”“Oh, all kinds of research is done on tissue gathered during medical procedures. Most people don’t know that, but it’s very common,” Doe said.“OK, but why are you here now?”“Well, your appendix turned out to be very special. It was secreting some kind of pus that no one had seen before. After many tests, it turned out to be a new chemical compound with commercial applications. So a patent was filed based on that compound and turned into a consumer product,” Doe admitted.“That sounds disgusting. What was it used in? Because I want to make sure to never buy it,” I said.“It’s the basis for the adhesive on Post-It Notes,” Doe said.“Are you freaking kidding me? Post-It Notes are based on my old appendix?”“I’m absolutely serious, Mr. Kemper. Now we at DBII need your help. Unfortunately for us, you haven’t had anything removed lately. So I have to get your consent if we’re going to do further studies,” Doe said.“But you already got my goo-seeping appendix. I don’t have another one,” I said. “True, but sales have been down for Post-It Notes lately. So after the marketing and research boys talked it over for a while, they thought we should bring you in for a full body scan. Maybe you’ve got a spleen giving out or something else that we could pull out and see if we could use it,” Doe said.“This is pretty damn disturbing,” I said.“Why? You’re an organ donor, right? Same thing,” Doe said.“I don’t consider someone lucking into an organ if the Chiefs win a play-off game and I have a goddamn heart attack the same thing as companies making money off tissue I had removed decades ago and didn’t know anything about,” I said.“Fortunately, the American government and legal system disagree. So how about it, Mr. Kemper? Will you come with me?” Doe asked.“I dunno. What’s my end of this? You already owe me a fat check for the Post-Its.”“Oh, no. You won’t get any money from the Post-Its, or if any future discoveries from your tissues lead to more gains.” Doe said.“That’s complete bullshit!”“Again, the legal system disagrees with you. But this is for science, Mr. Kemper. You don’t want to hold up medical scientific research that could save lives, do you?”“It’s for Post-It Notes!”“Maybe, but who is to say that the cure for some terrible disease isn't lurking somewhere in your genes? Could you live with yourself if you prevented crucial medical research just because you were ticked off that you didn’t get any money for your appendix? Remember that it’s not like you could have NOT had your appendix removed. At least, not if you wanted to keep living. And I highly doubt that you would have had the resources to have it studied and discovered the adhesive for yourself even if you would have taken it home with you in a jar after it was removed. We’re the ones who spent all that money to get some good out of a piece of disgusting gunk that tried to kill you. So shouldn’t we be compensated? What are you? Some kind of damn dirty hippie liberal socialist?” Doe said in disgust“You’re a hell of a corporate lackey, Doe,” I said.“Thank you.”“Fine. I’ll do it,” I said as I signed the form. “But I want some free Post-It Notes.”“No deal. Steal them from work like everyone else,” Doe said.******Obviously, I‘m a big fat liar and none of this happened, but I really did have my appendix out as a kid. Plus, my tonsils got yanked and I’ve had my fair share of blood taken over the years. What this book taught me is that it’s highly likely that some of my scraps are sitting in frozen jars in labs somewhere. Yours, too. If any of us have anything unique in our tissues that may be valuable for medical research, it’s possible that they’d be worth a fortune, but we’d never see a dime of it.Henrietta Lacks couldn’t be considered lucky by any stretch of the imagination. A black woman who grew up poor on a tobacco farm, she married her cousin and moved to the Baltimore area. Her husband apparently liked to step out on her and Henrietta ended up with STDs, and one of her children was born mentally handicapped and had to be institutionalized. In 1951, Henrietta was diagnosed with cervical cancer by doctors at Johns Hopkins. During her biopsy, cell samples were taken and given to a researcher who had been working on the problem of trying to grow human cells. Henrietta’s cancer spread wildly, and she was dead within a year. But her cells turned out to be an incredible discovery because they continued growing at a very fast rate. The doctor at Johns Hopkins started sharing his find for no compensation, and this coincided with a large need for cell samples due to testing of the polio vaccine. The HeLa cells would be crucial for confirming that the vaccine worked and soon companies were created to grow and ship them to researchers around the world. Since then, Henrietta’s cells have been sent into outer space and subjected to nuclear tests and cited in over 60,000 medical research papersUnfortunately, no one ever asked Henrietta’s permission and her family knew nothing about the important role her cells played in medicine for decades. Poor and with little formal education, Henrietta’s children were confused by what was actually done to their mother and upset when they learned that her tissue was part of a multi-million dollar industry that they‘ve received no compensation from..Rebecca Skloot has written a fascinating book that clearly outlines why Henrietta’s cells were so important, why she went unrecognized for decades, the pain it’s caused her family, and the way that new medical discoveries over the last sixty years have opened a potential Pandora’s Box of legal and ethical issues regarding tissue collection, research, patents and money. This book brings up a lot of issues that we’re probably all going to be dealing with in the future. Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog."
31,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"This is an all-gold five star read.It's actually two stories, the story of the HeLa cells and the story of the Lacks family told by a journalist who writes the first story objectively and the second, in which she is involved, subjectively. The contrast between the poor Lacks family who cannot afford their medical bills and the research establishment who have made millions, maybe billions from these cells is ironic and tragic. It has been established by other law cases that if the family had gone for restitution they would not have got it, but that's a moot point as they couldn't afford a lawyer in any case. I have seen some bad reviews about this book. People who think that the story of the Lacks - poor rural African-Americans who never made it 'up' from slavery and whose lifestyle of decent working class folk that also involves incest, adultery, disease and crime, they just dismiss with 'heard it all before' and 'my family despite all obstacles succeeded so what is wrong with the Lacks?' I wonder if these people who not only totally can't see the wonderful writing that brings these people to life and who so lack in compassion themselves are the sort of people who oppose health care for the masses? As an extremely wealthy American tourist once put it to me, he had earned good health care by his hard work and success in life, it was one of the perks, why waste good money on, say, a a triple-bypass on someone who hasn't even succeeded enough to afford health insurance? That they were a drain on society, non-contributors and not the way America needed to go to move forward.I don't think you can rate people by what they have achieved materially. Success depends a great deal on opportunity and many don't have that. Henrietta Lacks didn't have it and her children didn't have it, not even her grandchildren made much of a way for themselves, but the next generation, the great grandchildren - ah now they are going in for Masters degrees and maybe their children will be major contributors. The author intends to recompense the family by setting up a scholarship for at least one of them. All of us came originally from poverty and to put down those that are still mired in the quicksand of never having enough spare cash to finance an education is cruel, uncompassionate and hardly looking to the future.HeLa cells have given us our future. They are the most researched and tested human cells in existence. All of us have benefited from the medical advances made using them and the book is recognition of what a great contribution Henrietta Lacks and her family with all their donations of tissue and blood, mostly stolen from them under false pretences, have made. Indeed one of the researchers who looks like having told a lot of lies (and then lied about that) in order to get the family to donate blood to further her research is still trying to get them to donate more. She's a hard-nosed scientist, with an excellent job and income and to her the Lacks are no more than providers of raw material. Sometimes you can't make hard and fast rulings. No I don't think we should have to give informed consent for experiments to be done on tissue or blood donated during a procedure or childbirth - that would slow medical research unbearably. I don't think cells should be identifiable with the donor either, it should be quite anonymous (as it now is). However, there is only ever one 'first' in any sphere and that one does deserve recognition and now with the book, some 50 years after her life ended, Henrietta Lacks has it. Good on yer, Rebecca Skloot, you've done a good thing here."

“She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?”
I've moved this book on and off my TBR for years. The truth is that, with few exceptions, I'm generally turned off by the thought of non-fiction. I'm a fan of fictional stories, and I think I've always felt that non-fiction will be dry, boring and difficult to get through. Especially a book about science, cells and medicine when I'm more of a humanities/social sciences kinda girl.But this book... it's just so interesting. It's written in a very easy, journalistic style and places the author into the story (some people didn't like this, but I thought it felt like you were going along for the journey). It's all the interesting bits of science, full of eye-opening and shocking discoveries, but it's also about history, sociology and race.I started reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks while sat next to my boyfriend. Every so often I would unknowingly gasp or mutter ""oh my god"" and he was like ""what? what?"" and I hadn't even realized I'd done it out loud. It's just full of surprises - and every one is true! It uncovers things you almost certainly didn't know about. And it just shows that sometimes real life can be nastier, more shocking, and more wondrous than anything you could imagine.Maybe you've heard of HeLa in passing, maybe you don't know anything about these cells that helped in cancer research, in finding a polio vaccine, in cloning, in gene mapping and discovering the effects of an atom bomb; either way, this tells an incredible and awful story of a poor, black woman in the American South who was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She is given back her humanity, becoming more than a cluster of cells and being shown for the tough, spirited woman she was. From her own family life to the frankly nauseating treatment of black patients in the 1950s, her story emerges.Not only that, but this book is about the injustices committed by the pharmaceutical industry - both in this individual case (how is it that Henrietta's family are dirt poor when she has revolutionized medicine?) and on a larger scale (during the 1950s, many prisoners were injected with cancer as part of medical experiments!). It's hard to believe what so-called ""professionals"" have gotten away with throughout history - things that we generally associate with Nazi death camps.I honestly could not put it down. Maybe because it's not just about science and cells, but is mainly about all of the humanity and social history behind scientific discoveries. Maybe because Skloot is so damn passionate about her subject and that passion is transferred to the reader. Whatever the reason, I highly recommend it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"
33,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"This was a really good book that leaves one with more questions than it answers, especially at this moment with the explosion in investment and growth in health/biotech. A lot of those questions are ones I wouldn't know how to answer myself either. I think it's really important though that we all start grappling with and instituting better processes around things like informed consent. Also really horrible to think about this in larger societal terms, in the context of institutional racism, and the ways in which the Lacks family still is so socioeconomically disadvantaged while private biotechnology companies sell their mother's cells for so much money. I just feel so extremely uncomfortable with that. I think I wouldn't care so much if the cells were just part of the commons, available for free, or extremely cheaply, but to know people are profiting off of it, it really is quite disgusting. I try not to bring my politics to bear here quite too often but this really really makes me feel strongly that commercialization of things in biological research, especially people's biological matter and tissue shouldn't be happening. This whole situation just feels quite perverse honestly and the book left me feeling disheartened. The dual dehumanization of the Lacks family through science and commercialization is horrifying. And I think if we wants things to be better moving forward both need to be addressed, not just one."
34,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"On October 4, 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a thirty-one-year old black woman, died after a gruesome battle with a rapidly metastasizing cancer. During her treatment, the doctors at Johns Hopkins took some cells from her failing body and used them for research. This was not an unusual thing to have done in 1951. But the cells that came from Ms. Lacks’ body were unusual. They had qualities that made them uniquely valuable as research tools. Labeled “HeLa”, Henrietta’s cells were reproduced by the billions over the following sixty years and have been instrumental in experiments across a wide range of biological science. Today, HeLa cells are sold by the vial at impressive prices. Yet, Ms. Lacks’ family has seen not a penny of compensation from the work that has been made possible by their relative’s unique cells. Rebecca Skloot - from Powell'sRebecca Skloot, a science writer with articles published in many major outlets, spent years looking into the genesis of these cells. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells four stories. First is the tale of HeLa cells, and the value they have been to science; second is the life of, arguably, the most important cell “donor” in history, and of her family; third is a look at the ethics of cell “donation” and the commercial and legal significance of rights involved; and fourth is the Visible Woman look at Skloot’s pursuit of the tales. Each story is significant. The contribution of HeLa cells has been huge and it is important to know how these cells came to be so widely used, and what are the characteristics that make them so valuable. Skloot goes into a reasonable level of detail for those of us who do not make our living in a lab coat. She adds information on how cell cultures can become contaminated, and how that impacts completed research. She also offers a description of telomeres, strings of DNA at the end of chromosomes critical to longevity, and key to the immortality of HeLa cells. Fascinating stuff. Henrietta Lacks - From Science And FilmSkloot constructs a biography of Henrietta, and patches together a portrait of the life of her family, from her ancestors to her children, siblings and other relations. It is with a source of pride, among other emotions, that her family regards Henrietta’s impact on the world. Skloot delves into these feelings, and the experiences the Lacks family members have had over the decades with people trying to write about Henrietta, and people trying to exploit their interest in Henrietta for dark purposes.The author had to overcome considerable family resistance before she was able to get them to meet with and ultimately open up to her. She takes us through her process, showing who she talked with, when, and the result of those conversations, what institutions she contacted re locating and gaining access to information about Henrietta and some other family members. Most interesting, and at times frustrating, is her story of how she gained the trust of some, if not all, of the Lacks family. This is like presenting a how-to of her research process, a blow-by-blow description of the way research is done in the real world, and it is very enlightening.The Immortal Tale of Henrietta Lacks has received considerable acclaim. It is all well-deserved. The book is an eye-opening window into a piece of our history that is mostly unknown. It presents science in a very manageable way and gives us plenty to think about the next time we have a blood test or any other medical procedure. This book may not be as immortal as Henrietta’s cells, but it will stay with you for a very long time.The HBO Film airs on April 22, 2017==============================EXTRA STUFF8/8/13 - NY Times article - A Family Consents to a Medical Gift, 62 Years Later3/29/17 - Washington Post - On the eve of an Oprah movie about Henrietta Lacks, an ugly feud consumes the family - by Steve Hendrix"

Strengths:
*Fantastically interesting subject!One woman's cancerous cells are multiplied and distributed around the globe enabling a new era of cellular research and fueling incredible advances in scientific methodology, technology, and medical treatments. This strain of cells, named HeLa (after Henrietta Lacks their originator), has been amazingly prolific and has become integrated into advancements of science around the world (space travel, genome research, pharmaceutical treatments, polio vaccination, etc). *Thought-Provoking Ethical Questions This book makes you ponder ethical questions historically raised by the unfolding sequence of events and still rippling currently. Ex. 1) Informed consent: Henrietta did not provide informed consent (not required in those days). Ex. 2) Genetic rights/non-rights: her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later. Ex. 3) Patents and profits for biologic material: zero profits realized by Henrietta or her descendants; multiple-millions in profits have been realized by individuals and corporations utilizing her genetic material.*Biographical description of Henrietta and interviews with her family.  The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications. We're reading about actual, valuable people and historic events.
Weaknesses:
*Framework: the book is framed around the author's journey of writing the story and her interactions with Henrietta's family. I thought the author got in the way and would have preferred to have to read less of her journey and more coverage of the science involved and its ethical implications. I found myself distinctly not caring how many times the author circled the block or how many trips she made to Henrietta's birthplace.*Lack of Clarity: By mid-point through the book, I was wishing the biographical approach was more refined and focused. The narrative swerved through the author's interest in various people as she encountered them along the way: Henrietta, Henrietta's immediate family, scientists, Henrietta's extended family, a neighborhood grocery store owner, a con artist, Henrietta's youngest daughter, Henrietta's oldest daughter, etc. Everything was a side dish; no particular biography satisfied as a main course.
Bottom Line:
This book won't join my 'to re-read' shelf...but has whetted my appetite for further exploration of this important woman, fascinating topic and intriguing ethical questions.I was left wanting more:-more detail surrounding the science involved, -more coverage of past and present ethical implications-a more refined biography of Henrietta, and -a more focused look at the impact and implications of the HeLa cell strain line on Henrietta's descendants."

A young black mother dies of cervical cancer in 1950 and unbeknownst to her becomes the impetus for many medical advances through the decades that follow because of the cancer cells that were taken without her permission. This book evokes so many thoughts and feelings, sometimes at odds with one another. It is thought provoking and informative in the details and heartbreaking in the rendering of the personal story of Henrietta Lacks. I was madder than hell that people/companies made loads of money on the Hela cell line while some members of the Lacks family didn’t have health insurance . Yet, I am grateful for the research advances that made a polio vaccine possible, advanced cancer research and genetics, and so much more.Rebecca Skloot does a wonderful job of presenting the moral and legal questions of medical research without consent meshing this with the the human side giving a picture of the woman whose cells saved so many lives. We get to know her family, especially her daughter Deborah who worked tirelessly with the author to discover what happened to her mother. This made it all so real - not just a recitation of the facts. The scientific aspects are very detailed but understandable. It was the sections on Henrietta and her family that I wanted to read the most.In 1950 there was “no formal research oversight in the United States.” Years later there are laws on “informed consent “ and how medical research is conducted, and protection of privacy for medical records. Yet even today, there are controversies over the ownership of human tissue. The in depth research over years in writing this book is evident and I believe a heartfelt effort to recognize Henrietta Lacks for her unwitting contribution to medical research."
38,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114573-chelsea,3,"This could have been an incredible book. Henrietta Lacks' story is finally told--and Skloot makes very clear how important Lacks' cells have been to the last 60 years of science and, paradoxically, how much Henrietta and her family suffered because those cells were taken from Henrietta without her consent. But in her effort to contrast the importance and profitability of Henrietta's cells with the marginalization and impoverishment of Henrietta's family, Skloot makes three really big mistakes. First, she's not transparent about her own journalistic ethics, which is troubling in a book about ethics. Did the Lacks family end up benefiting from her book financially? Did all Lacks give permission for their depictions in the book? We never know. Second, Skloot's narration when describing the Lacks family suffering--sexual abuse, addiction, disability, mental illness--lacks sensitivity; it often feels clinical and sometimes even voyeuristic. Again, this is disturbing in a book that concerns the importance of dignity, consent, etc.Finally, Skloot inserts herself into the story over and over, not so subtly suggesting that she is a hero for telling Henrietta's story. Sometimes, it appears that she is making the very offensive suggestion that she, a highly educated unreligious white woman, has healed the Lacks family by showing them science and history."
39,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731872-kathleen,3,"My thoughts on this book are kind of all over the place. I feel for the Lacks family, I really do. It's hard to read about the poverty and lack of education and the cavalier approach towards informed consent in the early days of Johns Hopkins Research Hospital. The fact that the HeLa cell line is the foundation of so much valuable research is rightfully a source of pride for the family of Henrietta Lacks. I don't think they will ever see monetary compensation for their mother's cancer cell line, however. That horse left the barn a long, long time ago.Furthermore, I don't feel the admiration for the author of this book like I think many others do. She wanted to make herself out to be different than all the rest of the people who wrote about the woman behind the HeLa cell line but I only saw the similarities. Yes, she has established a scholarship fund for the descendants of Henrietta Lacks but I got tired of hearing again and again how she financed her research herself. I think the exploitation is there, just prettied up a bit with a lot of self-congratulatory descriptions of how HARD she had to try to talk to the family and how MANY times she called asking for interviews. At times I felt like she badgered them worse than the unethical people who had come before.The sadness of this story is really about the devastation of a family when its unifying force, a strong mother, is removed. Piled on with more sadness about the appalling institutional conditions for mentally handicapped patients (talking about Henrietta Lacks' oldest daughter) back in the 50's and you have tragedy on top of more tragedy."
40,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,4,"This is a very powerful and informative story. Also, with the history of personal freedoms, civil rights, and right to privacy/requiring consent, this is a very important books. I am not sure the details about the science involved in the story will appeal to all. Just the same as how those who are here for the science may be disinterested in the background stories of the people involved. But, if you think you will like one of the other, I don’t think the one you don’t care for will be distracting.With that in mind, I will continue with the statement that it really is two books: the science and the people. First, the background of cell and tissue research in the last 100 years is intriguing and to hear about all of the advances and why Henretta Lacks was key to them is fascinating. Second, the background of not only the Lacks family, but also others who have had their tissues/cells used for research without permission, gives a lot of food for thought. Almost every medical advancement, and many scientific advancements, in the past 60 years are because of Henrietta Lacks. But, questions about the consent she gave, what she understood about her cells being used, and how much the family has benefited are all questioned and discussed. It really hits hard to think that you may have no control over parts of you once they are no longer part of your body. Also, the fiscal and research ramifications of giving people more rights over their body tissue/cells really creates a huge Catch-22. As I had surgery earlier this year that involved some tissue being removed for analysis, it started to make me wonder what I signed on all those forms and if my cells might still be out there being used for research.The only part of the book that kind of dragged for me was the time that the author spent with the family late in the book. After listening to an interview with the author it was surprising to hear that this part of the book may have been her original focus (how the family has dealt with the revelations surrounding the use of their mother’s cells), but to me it kind of dragged and got repetitive. I don’t think it is bad and others may find it interesting, it just was what brought down my interest in the story a little bit.If you like science-based stories, medical-based stories, civil/personal rights history, and/or just love a decent non-fiction, I think this book is very worth checking out."
41,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1992225-liz-nutting,5,"When I was a graduate student in the field of Ethics, one of my favorite pedagogical strategies, as both a teacher and a student, was the case study. A good case study can make an abstract ethical issue more concrete. A really good case study can turn a deeply contentious issue into an opportunity for thoughtfulness and compassion; right and wrong (to the extent that those concepts even belong in the study of ethics) are nuanced by descriptions of circumstances or values or human need that can make it easier to see and hear and believe the ones on the other side(s) of an issue. Often the case studies are hypothetical, or descriptions of actual cases pared to ""just the facts, ma'am,"" without all the possible extenuating circumstances that can shape difficult decisions. For some students, this causes great angst. How could they be asked to make a judgment, especially one that might involve life or death, without knowing all the details? And of course, at the end of the lesson, everyone wants to know what really happened, how things turned out ""in real life."" On those rare occasions when we actually do know something of the outcome, it is clear that knowing what ""really"" happened almost never makes the decision easier, clearer, or less agonizing. And that is what makes The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks so deeply compelling and challenging. It is the rare story of the outcome of a seemingly inconsequential decision by a doctor and a researcher in 1951, one that few at that time would have ever seen as an ethical decision, let alone an unethical one. A researcher studying cell cultures needs samples; a doctor treating a woman with aggressive cervical cancer scrapes a few extra cells of that cancer into a Petri dish for the researcher. The missing cells had no bearing whatsoever on the outcome of the woman's disease, so no harm done. A few weeks later the woman is dead, but her cancer cells are living in the lab. The bare bones ethical issue at stake--whether it is ethically warranted to take a patient's tissues without consent and subsequently use them for scientific and medical research--is even now not a particularly contentious one...yet. Legally, the case law is settled: tissue removed in the course of medical treatment or testing no longer belongs to the patient. It is, in essence, refuse, and one woman's trash is another man's treasure. Ethically, almost all the professional guidelines encourage researchers to obtain consent, but they have no teeth (and most were non-existent in 1951 anyway). In reality, the vast majority of the tissue taken from patients is of limited use. But there are those rare times when a single person's cells have the potential to break open the worlds of science and medicine, to the benefit of millions--and the enrichment of a very few. Such was the case with the cells of cervical cancer taken from Henrietta Lacks at Johns Hopkins University hospital. HeLa cells grew in the lab of George Gey. And grew. And grew, unlike any cell before it. Next, they were carried to a different laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, where Jonas Salk used them to successfully test his polio vaccine, and thus the cancer that had killed Henrietta Lacks directly led to the healing of millions worldwide. Soon HeLa cells would be in almost every major research laboratory in the world. They traveled to Asia to help find a cure for hemorrhagic fever and into space to study the effects of zero gravity on human cells. Even today, almost 60 years after Henrietta's death, HeLa cells are some of the most widely used by the scientific community. With such immeasurable benefits as these, who could possibly doubt the wisdom of Henrietta's doctor to take a tiny bit of tissue? But the ""real"" story is much more complicated. Henrietta Lacks was uneducated, poor and black. Her cancer was treated in the ""colored"" ward of Johns Hopkins. Her death left five children without their mother, to be raised by an abusive cousin. Should any of that matter in weighing the morality of taking tissue from a patient without her consent, especially in light of the benefits? God knows our country's history of medical experimentation on the poor and minority populations is not pretty. Ironically, one of the laboratories researching with HeLa cells in the 1950s was the one at the Tuskegee Institute--at the very same time that the infamous syphilis studies were taking place. In light of that history, Henrietta's race and socioeconomic status can't help but be relevant factors in her particular case. But her children's status? What bearing does that have? According to author Rebecca Skloot, in ethical discussions of the use of human tissue, ""[t]here are, essentially, two issues to deal with: consent and money."" Both become issues for Henrietta's children. The family didn't learn until 1973 that their mother's cells had been taken, or that they'd played such a vital role in the development of scientific knowledge. They spent the next 30 years trying to learn more about their mother's cells. As they learned of the money made by the pharmaceutical companies and other companies as a direct result of HeLa cells, they inevitably asked questions about what share, if any, they were entitled to. As Henrietta's eldest son put it, ""If our mother so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?"" But even more than financial compensation, the family wants recognition--and respect--for their mother. They want the woman behind her contributions acknowledged for who she is--a black woman, a mother, a person with name longer than four letters. And they want to know the mother they never knew, to find out the facts of her death. In the lab at Johns Hopkins, looking through a microscope at her mother's cells for the first time, daughter Deborah sums it up: ""John Hopkin [sic] is a school for learning, and that's important. But this is my mother. Nobody seem to get that."" Would a fully informed Henrietta Lacks have made the decision to give her tissue to George Gey if asked? Would her decision either way have had any affect whatsoever on her children's future lives? We'll never know, of course. But reading the story behind the case study makes these questions far more potent than any ethics textbook can. And as science now unravels the strains of our DNA--thanks in no small part to HeLa--these are no longer inconsequential questions for any of us. Perhaps we, too, like the doctors and scientists who have long studied HeLa, can learn from the case study of Henrietta Lacks. "
42,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-bionic-jean,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is is an extraordinary book. By turns it is shocking, informative and tragic. There is brilliance - but also deep injustice. It is in part an account of the development of genetics, part social commentary, and partly the story of one woman, Henrietta Lacks. She was an African-American woman descended from slaves and one white slave-owner (Lacks), and she lived as many hundreds of black people still did even as late as the 1950's, in poverty in an old slave-cabin - the ""home-house"" - in East Baltimore. And although the events do not always make for easy reading, the author assures us that it is completely non-fiction. Nothing has been invented, nothing exaggerated. The author has done her level best to tell things as they were. Although the name ""Henrietta Lacks"" is comparatively unknown, ""HeLa"" cells are routinely used in scientific experiments worldwide today, and have been for decades. They are the only human cells thought to be scientifically ""immortal"" ie if they are provided with the correct culture and environment they do not die. They were cut from a tumour in the cervix of Henrietta Lacks a few months before she died in 1951; extracted because she had a particular virulent form of cancer. Despite extreme measures taken in the laboratories to protect the cells, human cells had always inevitably died after a few days. HeLa cells though, stayed alive in the petri dish, and proved to be virtually unstoppable, growing faster and stronger than any other cells known.These HeLa cells were used to develop the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilisation and a host of other medical treatments. They were sent on the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity. It is fair to say that they have helped with some of the most important advances in medicine. But there is a terrible irony and injustice in this. The people to benefit from this were largely white people. Henrietta Lacks's family and descendants suffered appalling poverty. Working from dawn to dusk in poisonous tobacco fields was the norm as soon as the children were able to stand. Moving from Virginia's tobacco production to Bethlehem Steel, a boiler manufacturer in South Boston, was little better, as they were then exposed to asbestos and coal. The families had intermingled for generations. Henrietta and Day, her husband, were first cousins, and this was by no means unusual. So the predisposition to illness was both hereditary and environmental. But access to medical help was virtually nil. Most hospitals accepted only whites, or grudgingly admitted so-called ""colored"" people to a separate area, which was far less well funded and staffed. The Lacks family had to travel a long way in order to be treated, and then were not allowed the privilege of proper explanations as to the treatment given - or the tissue samples extracted.At this time unusual cells were taken routinely by doctors wanting to make their own investigations into cancer (which at that time was thought to be a virus) and many other conditions. No permission was sought; none was needed. The Hippocratic oath doctors set such store by dates from the 4th Century BC, and makes no mention of it; neither did the law of the time require it. It was not until 1947, that the subject was raised. Nazi doctors had performed many ethically unsound operations and experiments on live Jews, and during the trials after the war the Nuremberg Code - a 10 point code of ethics - was set up. This states that, ""The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential."" Even then it was advice, not law. Rebecca Skloot says that Howard Jones, the doctor who had originally diagnosed Henrietta Lacks' cancer, said, ""Hopkins, with its large indigent black population, had no dearth of clinical material."" It was clearly a racial norm of the time. In fact to be fair, the white doctors had no real conception that what they were doing had an ethical side. George Gey and his assistants were responsible for isolating the genetic material in Henrietta's cells - an astonishing feat. Gey happily shared the cells with any scientists who asked. The issue of payment was never raised, but the HeLa cells fast became a commodity, and the Lacks's family, who were never consulted about anything, mistakenly assumed until very recently that Gey must have made a fortune out of them. As Henrietta's daughter Deborah said, ""Them white folks getting rich of our mother while we got nothin."" Skloot carefully chronicles some of the most shocking medical stories from these times. The reader infers from her examples that testing on the impoverished and disadvantaged was almost routine. One notorious study was into syphilis and apparently went on for 40 years. It was called the ""Tuskegee study"", and involved thousands of males at varying stages of the disease. At the time it was known that they could be cured by penicillin, but they were not given this treatment, in order that doctors could study the progress of the disease. In this case they were volunteers, but were encouraged by the offer of free travel to the hospital, a free meal when they got there, and the promise of $50 for their families after they died, for funeral expenses. There are many such poignant examples. The author also says that in 1954 thousands of chronically ill elderly people, convicts and even some children, were injected by a Dr. Chester Southam with HeLa cells, basically just to see what would happen. Of course many of them went on to develop cancer. One man who had Hela cells injected in his arm produced small tumours there within days. But the patients were never informed of this, and if they did happen to ask were told they were being ""tested for immunity"". (We are told that Southam was prosecuted for this much later in 1966.) It was not until 1957 that there was any mention in law of ""informed consent."" Confidentially and privacy violation issues came far later.After her death, four of Henrietta Lacks's children, Lawrence, Deborah, Sonny and Joe, were put in the charge of Ethel, a friend of the family who had been very envious of Henrietta. It appears that she was incredibly cruel to the children, hardly ever feeding them until late, after a day's work, when they would be given a meagre crust. She would also drag the youngest one, Joe, out of bed at will, and beat him unmercifully. Joe was only 4 months old when his mother died and grew up to have severe behavioural problems. In fact later on on life, all these children grew to have not only health problems (including all being almost deaf) but a myriad of social problems too - being involved in burglary, assault and drugs - and spent a lot of their lives in prison.One of Henrietta's five children had been put in ""Crownsville Hospital for the Negro Insane"" when she was still tiny, because Henrietta was too ill to care for her any more. The story of this child, which is gradually told through Skloot's text as more of it is revealed, is heart-breaking. It is not clear why Elsie was so slow, but her mental retardation is now thought to be partly due to syphilis, and partly due to being born on the home-house stone floor - which was routine for such families at the time - and banging her head during birth. It was not known what had subsequently happened to Elsie until Skloot's research, but then some records were discovered. A photograph of Elsie shows a miserable child apparently in pain in a distorted position. Apparently brain scans then necessitated draining the surrounding brain fluid. Never mind that the patient might then suffer violent headaches, fits and vomiting for 2-3 months until the fluid reformed; it gave a better picture. Many people had been sent to this institution because of ""idiocy"" or epilepsy; the assumption now is that that they were incarcerated to get them out of the way, and that tests like this, often for research, were routine. Figures from 1955, when Elsie died, showed that at that time the hospital had 2700 patients, which was 800 over the maximum capacity. The ratio of doctors to patients was 1 doctor for 225 patients.Add into this the appalling inhumanity of history where white people used black people for their own ends, and the fears of Henrietta's family and community become inevitable. There had been stories for generations of white-coated doctors coming at dead of night and experimenting on black people. This became confused - or perhaps vindicated - by the Ku Klux Klan. Stories of voodoo, charismatic religious experiences, dire poverty, lack of basic education (one of Henrietta's brothers was more fortunate in that he had 4 years' schooling in total) untreated health problems and the prevailing 1950's attitudes of never questioning the doctor, all fed into the mix resulting in ignorance and occasional hysteria.Much of the first part of this book includes descriptions of scientific research and discoveries; both the theory and practise of how genes were isolated. Alternating with this is the background to the racial tensions, and the history of Henrietta Lacks' ancestry and family. Rebecca Skloot, a science writer, had been fascinated by the potential story since school days, when she first heard of HeLa cells, but nobody seemed to know anything about them. She started this book in her 20's, and spent a decade researching it, financed by credit cards and student loans. As a white woman she was treated with gross suspicion by all Henrietta Lacks's family. Eventually she formed a good relationship with Deborah, but it took a year before Deborah would even speak to her, and Deborah's brothers were very resistant. Several of them were pastors, as was James Pullam, her husband. They believed the Bible literally and had many fears about how Henrietta's cells were used. Deborah herself could not understand how they were immortal. Could her mother's cells feel pain when they were exploded, or infected? Would they develop into half-human half-chicken freaks when they were split and combined with chicken cells? Were there millions of clones all looking like her mother wandering around London? The media worldwide had played its part in adding to these fears, which had been spawned by a genuine ignorance.The interviews with Henrietta's family, and the progress and discoveries Skloot made accompanied by Deborah in the second part of the book, do make the reader uneasy. Indeed parts of these passages read like a trashy novel. Skloot says she wanted to report the conversation verbatim, so the vernacular is reported intact. Fair enough. But there is a lot of, ""Deborah shouted"" or, ""Lawrence yelled"". Of course they did! All of Henrietta's children had severe health problems, probably due to a variety of factors; their environment, upbringing and genetic inheritance. They were all very hard of hearing, so yes, they would shout when amongst themselves. Add to this Skloot's tendency to describe the attributes and appearance of a family member as ""beautiful hazel-nut brown skin"" or ""twinkling eyes"" and there is a whiff of condescension which does not sit well. Does it add anything to this account? Would a description of the author as having ""raven-black hair and full glossy lips"" help? Of course not. The author may feel she is being complimentary; she is not. She is being patronising. But it is difficult to know how else the total incomprehension and ignorance of how a largely white society operated could have been conveyed, other than by this verbatim reportage, even though at worst it comes across as extremely crass, and at best gently humorous.It would be convenient to imagine that these appalling cases were a thing of the past. But the book continues detailing injustices until the date of its publication in 2010. Henrietta's son, Sonny had a quintuple bypass in 2003. Skloot reports, ""The last thing he remembered before falling unconscious under the anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened in medicine."" So far, so good. There was recognition. But Skloot then delivers the final shot, ""Sonny woke up more than $125,500 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery."" As Lawrence (Henrietta's eldest son) says elsewhere, ""It's not fair! She's the most important person in the world and her family [are] living in poverty. If our mother [is] so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""Henrietta's original cancer had in fact been misdiagnosed. It was discovered years later that because she had syphilis, she had the genital warts HPV virus, which does actually invade the DNA. There is an intriguing section on this, as well as the ""HeLa bomb"", where one doctor painstakingly proved to the whole of the scientific community that a lot of their research had been flawed, as HeLa cells were contaminating many of the other cells they had been working with and drawing conclusions from. They were so virulent that they could travel on the smallest particle of dust in the atmosphere, and because Gey had given them so generously, there was no real record of where they had all ended up.Deborah herself always lived in fear of inheriting her mother's cancer. Because of this she readily submitted to tests. Victor McKusick took blood samples, which Deborah believed were for ""cancer tests."" In fact though, Skloot claims, they were for his own research. This is another example of chronic misunderstanding. He knew of the family's mental anguish and the unfair treatment they had had. He thought she understood why he wanted the blood. He gave her an autographed copy of his book - a technical manual on Genetics. Of this, Deborah commented wryly, ""It would have been nice if he'd told me what the damn thing said too."" And again, ""I would like some health insurance so I don't got to pay all that money every month for drugs my mother cells probably helped to make.""In 2001, Skloot tells us, Christoph Lengauer, now the Head of Oncology in one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, said of Henrietta, ""Her cells are how it all started."" And to Deborah, ""Once there is a cure for cancer, it's definitely largely because of your mother's cells.""In 2005 the US government issued gene patents relating to the use of 20% of known human genes, including Alzheimer's, asthma, colon cancer and breast cancer. The injustices however, continue. Pharmaceutical companies, scientists and universities now control what research is done, and the costs of the resulting tests and therapies. An example of how this continues to impede scientific development according to the author is that of the company Myriad Genetics, who hold the patent on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. (These are the genes which are responsible for most hereditary breast cancers.) The company had arbitrarily set a charge of $3000 to have this test, amid furore amongst scientists. They had licensed the use of the test. Anyone who ignored it received a threat of litigation. Eventually in 2009 they were sued by the American Civil Liberties Union, representing a huge number of people including 150,000 scientists for inhibiting research. The commercialisation of human biological materials has now become big business.There seems to have been some attempts at restitution since this book was published, the most recent being in August 2013. There was an agreement between the family and The National Institutes of Health to give the family some control over the access to the cells' DNA code, and a promise of acknowledgement on scientific papers. The committee set to oversee this arrangement will have 6 members, 2 of whom will be members of the family. The wheels have been set in motion.All in all this is an important and startlingly original book by a dedicated and compassionate author. It speaks to every one of us, regardless of our colour, nationality or class. Skloot admitted that it took a long time to decide the structure of the book, in order to include all the important aspects that she wished to. There are three sections: ""Life"", ""Death"" and ""Immortality"", plus an ""Afterword"". The main thrust throughout is clearly the enduring injustice the Lacks family suffered. So perhaps the final words should be Joe's, or (as he changed his name when he converted to Islam in prison), Zakariyya's: ""I believe what them doctors did was wrong. They lied to us for 25 years, kept them cells from us, then they gonna say them things DONATED by our mother. Them cells was stolen! Those fools come take blood from us sayin they need to run tests and not tell us that all these years they done profitized off of her…. You don't lie and clone behind their backs. That's wrong - it's one of the most violating parts of this whole thing….Then doctors say her cells [are] so important and did all this and that to help people. But it didn't do no good for her, and it don't do no good for us. If me and my sister need something, we can't even go and see a doctor cause we can't afford it.""It's too late for some of Henrietta's family. For how many others will it also be too late?"

(Matthew 26:26-28, NIV Bible)From The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks: There's no way of knowing how many of Henrietta's cells are alive today. One scientist estimates that if you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown on a scale, they'd weigh more than 50 million metric tons--an inconceivable number, given that an individual cell weighs almost nothing....Her cells were part of research into the genes that cause cancer and those that suppress it; they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, and Parkinson's disease; and they've been used to study lactose digestion, sexually transmitted diseases, appendicitis, human longevity, mosquito mating, and the negative cellular effects of working in sewers....Like guinea pigs and mice, Henrietta's cells have become the standard laboratory workhorse.(The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, pp. 2-4)Questions:1) Assuming Jesus Christ was speaking literally, please calculate the total mass and volume of the Body of Christ consumed in the period between the Last Supper (c. 30-36 AD/CE) and the present day.

But what happens when her biological material generates billions of dollars for the drug and pharmaceutical industry, leaving her dirt poor descendants in the lurch?Yeah, I know I wrote that like the teaser for one of my mysteries but the only mystery here is how people who have profited from the diseased cells that killed a woman can sleep at night while her kids and grand kids don't have two nickels to rub together.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is really two stories. One of Henrietta Lacks and her cancer cells that lived decades beyond her years, and the other of Rebecca Skloot and the surviving members of the Lacks family.Henrietta Lacks married her counsin, contracted multiple STD's due to his philandering ways, and died of misdiagnosed cervical cancer by the time she was 30. However, the cancer that killed her survives today in the form of HeLa cells, which have been taken to the moon, exposed to every manner of radiation and illness, and all sorts of other experiments. While other people are raking in money due to the HeLa research, the surviving Lacks family doesn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of, bringing me to the real meat of the book: The pharmaceutical industry is a bunch of dickbags. Imagine having something removed that generated billions of dollars of revenue for people you've never met and still needing to watch your budget so you can pay your mortage. Fair? Shit no, but that's the way it is, apparently. It also seems illogical that you can patent things you didn't create but again, that's the way the cookie crumbles.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an eye-opening look at someone most of us have never heard of but probably owe some sort of debt to. Also, it drags the big money pharma companies out in the sun. Sadly, they do not burst into flames like the vampires they are. Four out of five stars. I'm going to go read something happy now."
45,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,5,"The gift of life is surely the greatest gift of all. So how can the story of the remarkable woman who gave that gift over and over again to millions of people have been overlooked for so long?In 1951 a poor African American woman in Maryland became an uninformed donor to medical science. Henrietta Lacks died at age 31 of cervical cancer at John Hopkins hospital in Baltimore. Then doctors discovered that tumor cells they had removed from her body earlier continued to thrive in the lab - a medical first.Before long, her cells, dubbed HeLa cells, would be used for research around the world, contributing to major advances in everything from cancer treatments to vaccines; from aging to the life cycle of mosquitoes; nuclear bomb explosions to effect of gravity on human tissue during flights to outer space. An estimated 50 million metric tons of her cells were reproduced; thousands of careers have been build, and initiated more than 60 000 scientific studies until now, but Henrietta Lacks never gave permission for that research, nor had her family.In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca Skloot gracefully tells the story of the real woman and her descendants; the history of race-related medical research, including the role of eugenics; the struggles of the Lacks family with poverty, politics and racial issues; the phenomenal development of science based on the HeLa cells, in a language that can be understood by everyone. She combined the family's story with the changing ethics and laws around tissue collection, the irresponsible use of the family's medical information by journalists and researchers and the legislation preventing the family from benefiting from it all.COMMENTSI was gifted this book in December but never realized the impact it had internationally, neither would have on me. Until I finished reading it last night, I did not know it was an international bestseller, as well as read by so many of my GR friends! It was total surprise, since nonfiction is normally not a regular star on bestseller lists, right?The debate around the moral issue, and the experiences of the poor family were very well presented in the book, which was truly well written and objective as far as possible. For me personally, the question of how this woman, who basically saved millions of people's lives, were overlooked, is answered in the arrogance of scientists who deemed it unnecessary to respect the rights of people unable to fend for themselves.The ethical and moral dilemmas it created in America, when the family became aware of their mother's contribution to science without anyone's knowledge or consent, just enabled the commercial enterprises who benefited massively from her cells, to move to other countries where human rights are just a faint star in a unlimited universe. The Lacks family drew a line in the sand of how far people must be exploited in America. Unfortunately the medical fraternity just moved their operations elsewhere.Tissue and organ harvesting thrive in the world, it is globally a massive industry, with the poorest of the poor still the uninformed donors. An open secret. There are numerous stories, especially in India, where people wake up and realize they were operated on and one of their organs is missing. Stolen. By the time they became aware of it, the organ had already been transplanted in America and elsewhere in the world. That's no secret. Everything is justified as long as science is involved.  Nowadays people in other parts of the world sell their organs, even though it is illegal in most countries. According to American laws people cannot sell their tissue, which is part of human organs? People can donate it though, then it is acceptable.Yet someone else can patent your cells, but you're not allowed to be compensated, since the minute it leaves your body, it is regarded as waste, disposed of, and therefor not deemed your 'property' anymore. Huh?This book was a good and necessary read. The human interest side of it, telling the story of the family was eye-opening and excellent. A little bit of melodramatic, but how else would it become a bestseller, if ordinary readers like us could not relate to it. It was very well-written indeed. Thanks to Rebecca Skloot, in 2010, sixty years later, HeLa now has a history, a face and an address. Finally, Henrietta Lacks, and not the anonymous HeLa, became a biological celebrity. In 1951 Dr. Grey's lab assistant handled yet just another tissue sample of hundreds, when she received Henrietta's to prepare for research. She named it HeLa(first two letters of the patient's name and last name). But a few months later she visited the body of the deceased Henrietta Lacks in the mortuary to collect more samples. When she saw the woman's red-painted toenails, a lightbulb went on.Mary Kubicek: “Oh jeez, she’s a real person. . . . I started imagining her sitting in her bathroom painting those toenails, and it hit me for the first time that those cells we’d been working with all this time and sending all over the world, they came from a live woman. I’d never thought of it that way.”John Hopkins hospital could have considered naming a wing of their research facilities after Henrietta Lack. Why don't they?Nevertheless, this book should be read by everybody. Without it the world would have been a lot poorer and less human.The world has a lot to answer for.RECOMMENDED for sure!EDIT I googled the Lacks family and landed upon the website of the Lacks Foundation, which was started by Rebecca Skloot. http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/That news TOTALLY made my day. I wish them all the best and hope they will succeed in their goals and dreams. A wonderful initiative. Just imagine what can be accomplished if every single person, organization, research facility and medical company who benefitted for Henrietta Lacks's tissue cells, donate only $1 (one single dollar)? Yes, just imagine that!So many positive things happened to the family after the book was published. It just brings tears of joy to my eyes.http://www.lacksfamily.net/index.phpAnd finally: May 29, 2010A Historic Day: Henrietta Lacks’s Long Unmarked Grave Finally Gets a Headstonethanks to Dr. Roland Pattillo at Morehouse School of Medicine, who donated a headstone after reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks."

Or, as is the case hear, having learned so much about which I knew nothing. My jaw is still on the floor after I finished this book and I can only imagine the controversies and discussions it might provoke. A thank you goes out to three Goodreads friends who recommended that I read this book and open an avenue for discussion. Aven, Brenda, and Rae, I hope we can begin a wild and intriguing dialogue, pulling others into the mix as things gain momentum.Who was Henrietta Lacks? What are HeLa cells? These are two of the foundational questions that Rebecca Skloot sought to answer in this poignant biographical piece. While I have tackled a number of biographies in my time as a reader, Skloot offered a unique approach to the genre in publication. Henrietta Lacks grew up in rural Virginia, picking tobacco and made ends meet as best she could. After marrying, she had a brood of children, including two of note, Elsie and Deborah, whose significance becomes apparent as the reader delves deeper into the narrative. Skloot offered up a succinct, but detailed narrative of how Lacks found an unusual mass inside her and was sent from her doctor to a specialist at Johns Hopkins (yes, THAT medical centre) for treatment. The mass was malignant and Lacks was deemed to have cervical cancer. Her surgeon, following the precedent of many doctors in the early 1950s, took samples of her tumour as well as that of the healthy part of her cervix, hoping to be able to have the cells survive so they could be analysed. Past attempts by doctors and scientists failed to keep cells alive for very long, which led to the constant slicing and saving technique used by those in the medical profession, when the opportunity arose. As it turns out, Lacks' cells were not only fascinating to explore, but George Gey (Head of Tissue Culture Research at Johns Hopkins) noticed that they lasted indefinitely, as long as they were properly fed. Gey realised that he had something on his hands and tried to get approval from the Lacks family, though did so in an extremely opaque manner. After Lacks succumbed to the cancer, doctors sought to perform an autopsy, which might allow them complete access to Lacks' body. Ignorant of what was going on, Henrietta's husband agreed, thinking that this was only to ensure his children and subsequent generations would not suffer the agony that cancer brought upon Henrietta. So began the conniving and secretive nature of George Gey. He harvested these 'special cells' and named them ""HeLa"", a brief combination of the original patient's two names. Their phenomenal growth and sustainability led him to ship them all over the country and eventually the world, though the Lacks family had no idea this was going on. HeLa cells were studied to create a polio vaccine (Jonas Salk used them at the University of Pittsburgh), helped to better understand cellular reactions to nuclear testing, space travel, and introduction of cancer cells into an otherwise healthy body during curious and somewhat inhumane tests on Ohio inmates. During all this, Johns Hopkins remained completely aware of what was going on and the transmission of HeLa cells around the globe, though did not think to inform the Lacks family, perhaps for fear that they would halt the use of these HeLa cells. Through the use of the term 'HeLa' cells, no one was the wiser and no direct acknowledgement of the long-deceased Henrietta Lacks need be made. Skloot provided much discussion about the uses, selling, 'donating', and experimenting that took place, including segments of the scientific community in America that were knowingly in violation of the Nuremberg Rules on human experimentation, though they danced their own legal jig to get around it all. The crux of the biography lay on this conundrum, though it would only find its true impact by exploring the lives of those Henrietta Lacks left behind after her death.Skloot took the time to pepper chapters with the history of the Lacks family as they grew up and, eventually, what happened when they were made aware that the HeLa cells existed, over two decades after they were obtained and Henrietta had died. Skloot split this other biographical piece into two parts, which eventually merge into one, documenting her research trips and interviews with the family alongside the presentation of a narrative that explores the fruits of those sit-down interviews. That Skloot tried to remain somewhat neutral is apparent, though through her connection to Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah, there was an obvious bias that developed. Superimposing these two narratives would, hopefully, offer the reader a chance to feel a personal connection to the Lacks family and the struggles they went through. In her discussions of the Lacks family, Skloot pulled no punches and presented the raw truths of criminal activity, abuse, addiction, and poverty alongside happy gatherings and memories of Henrietta. No biographical piece would be complete if it were only window dressing and trying to paint a rosy picture of this maligned family without offering at least a little peek into their daily lives. However, it balanced out and Skloot ended up with what the reader might call a decent introduction to this run of the mill family unit. Their ire at being duped by Johns Hopkins was apparent, alongside the dichotomy that HeLa cells were so popular, yet the family remained in dire poverty in the poor areas of Baltimore.The legal ramifications of HeLa cell usage was discussed at various points in the book, though there was no firm case related to it, at least not one including the Lacks family. One person I know sought to draw parallels between the Lacks situation and that of Carrie Buck, as illustrated wonderfully in Adam Cohen's book, Imbeciles (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...). While the courts surely fell short in codifying ownership of cells and research done on them, the focus of Skloot's book was the social injustice by Johns Hopkins, not the ineptitude of the US Supreme Court, as Cohen showed while presenting Buck v. Bell to the curious audience. While George Gey vowed that he gave away the HeLa cell samples to anyone who wanted them, surely the chain reaction and selling of them in catalogues thereafter allowed someone to line their pockets. Skloot offers up numerous mentions from the family, usually through Deborah, that the Lacks family was not seeking to get rich off of this discovery of immortal cells. While companies were spending millions and profiting billions from the early testing of HeLa cells, no one in the family could afford to see a doctor or purchase the medicines they needed (all of which came about because of tests HeLa cells facilitated!). It is both fascinating and angering to see the system wash their hands of the guilt related to immoral collecting and culturing of these HeLa cells. Skloot did explore the slippery slope of cells and tissue as discarded waste, as well as the need for consent in testing them, something the reader ought to spend some time exploring once the biographical narrative ends. It is sure to confound and confuse even the most well-grounded reader.The latter chapters touched upon the aptly used word from the title ""Immortal"" as it relates to Henrietta Lacks. Be it a biography that placed a story behind the woman, a detailed discussion of how the HeLa cell came into being and how its presence is all over the medical world, or that medical advancements as we know them will allow Henrietta Lacks' being to live on for eternity, the reader can reflect on which rationale best suits them. While there is a religious undertone in the biography as it relates to this, Christianity is not inculcated into the reader's mind, as it was not when Skloot learned about these things.Do I know Henrietta Lacks any better now, after Skloot completed her work? Most definitely! Can I, a complete scientific dunce, better understand HeLa cells and the idea behind cell growth and development? Completely! Do I feel there was an injustice done to the Lacks family by Johns Hopkins in 1951 and for decades to come? Yes, I do harbour a strong resentment to the duplicitous attitude undertaken by a hospital whose founder sought to ensure those who could not receive medical care on their own be helped and protected. Is there a lingering legal argument to be made for compensatory damages or at least some fiduciary responsibility owed to the Lacks family? That is a very grey area for me, only further complicated by the legal discussions in the Afterward and the advancement of new and complicated scientific discoveries, which also bore convoluted legal arguments. I will say this... Skloot brought Henrietta Lacks to life and if that puts a face to those HeLa cells, perhaps all those who read this book will think twice about those medicines used in their bodies and the scientific breakthroughs that are attributed to many powerful companies and/or nations. Maybe then, Henrietta can live on in all of us, immortal in some form or another.Kudos, Madam Skloot for intriguing someone whose scientific background is almost nil. You brought numerous stories to life and helped me see just how powerful one woman can be, silenced by death and the ignorance of what those around her were doing.Like/hate the review?

Her story is a heartbreaking one, but also an important one as her cancer cells, forever to be known as HeLa taken without her consent or knowledge, saved thousands of lives.Through ten long years of investigative work by this author, this narrative explores the experimental, racial and ethical issues of HeLa (the cells that would not die), while intertwining the story of her children's lives and the utter shock of finding out about their mother's cells more than twenty years later.""Physician Seeks Volunteers For Cancer Research."" Yeah, right........So many parts of this book made me sick to my stomach.....like the uncaring treatment of animals and all the poor souls injected with cancer cells without their knowledge in the name of research and greed; and oh, dam Ethel for the inhumane and brutal abuse to Henrietta's children too. Unbelievable!Whew! I must admit to being glad when I turned the last page on this one, but big time kudos to Rebecca Skloot for researching and telling Henrietta's story. She deserved so much better."
48,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,4,"Overall, a four star read that should probably be required reading for both biology and American history classes. (Actually, it was a far more interesting read than that makes it sound). While I had heard a great deal of buzz on the book, I wasn't prepared for how the story evolved. The book alternates between Henrietta Lacks' personal history, that of her family, a little of medical history and Skoot's actual pursuit of the story, which helps develop the story in historical context. Skoots included a lot more science than I expected, and even with ten years in the medical field, I was horrified at times. Skoots does a decent job of maintaining a journalistic tone, but some of the things she relates are terrible, from the way Henrietta grew up to cervical cancer treatment in the 50s and 60s. These were the days before cancer treatments approached the precision medicine it is aiming for today, and the treatments resembled nothing so much as trying to cut fingernails with garden shears. Just the thought of a radioactive seed tucked in the uterus causing tissue burn was enough to give me sympathetic cramps.Part of the evil in the book is the violence her family inflicted on each other, and it's one of the truly uncomfortable areas. I think that discomfort is important, because part of where this story comes from has to do with slavery and poverty. There isn't really an ethical high ground here, and that's part of Skoot's skill in setting up the story, and part of the problem in being a white woman telling the story of a black woman. The only reason I didn't give this a five star rating is that the narrative started to fall apart at the end, leaving behind the stories of the cell line and focus more on the breakdown of Henrietta's daughter, Deborah. While I understand she is the touchstone for the story, that she is partly telling the story of the mother through the daughter, much of Henrietta and the science is sidelined.Interesting questions popped up while reading; namely, why does everyone equate Henrietta's cancer cells with her person? As an illustration, if you tell people they have a cancerous tumor, the reaction is ""get rid of it."" It is categorized as ""other"" in everyone's mind and not recognized it as an intrinsic part of the person with cancer. It is not ""them."" Biologically speaking, I'm not sure the book answered the question of whether of not the HeLa cells actually were genetically identical to Henrietta, or if they were mutated--altered DNA. While that might be cold comfort, it's a huge philosophical and scientific question that is the pivot point for a number of issues. Treating the cells as if they were ""normal"" is part of what lead the scientists into disaster as evidenced by the discovery that so many cell lines were HeLa contaminated (I don't believe that transmission mechanism was explained either, which irks me). It also could be the basis for a sophisticated legal and ethical argument."

Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead in 1951. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سی و یکم ماه آگوست سال 2014 میلادیعنوان: حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس؛ نویسنده: ربکا اسکلاوت (اسکلوت)؛ مترجم: حسین راسی؛ تهران آرامش‏‫، 1390؛ در 426ص؛ شابک 9789649219165؛ موضوع: هنرییتا لکس از سال 1920م تا 1951م؛ بیماران و سرطان - اخلاق پزشکی - کشت یاخته ها - آزمایش روی انسان - سده 21م‬زندگینامه ی بیماری به نام «هنرییتا لکس» است، نامش «هنریتا لکس» بود، اما دانشمندان ایشان را با نام «هلا» میشناسند؛ یک کشاورز تنباکوی فقیر جنوب بود، که در همان سرزمین اجداد برده ی خود، کار میکردند، اما سلولهایش - که بدون آگاهی ایشان گرفته شده - به یکی از مهمترین ابزارهای پزشکی تبدیل شد؛ نخستین سلولهای «جاودانه»ی انسانی که، رشد یافته اند، و امروز هنوز هم زنده هستند، اگرچه ایشان در سال 1951میلادی درگذشته اند؛ اگر بتوانیم همه ی سلولهای «هلا» را که تکثیر شده اند، وزن کنیم، شاید وزن آنها به بیش از پنجاه میلیون تن برسد؛ سلولهای «هلا» برای ایجاد «واکسن فلج اطفال» حیاتی بودند؛ سلولهای ایشان، پرده از اسرار «سرطان»، «ویروسها» و اثرات «تشعشعات بمب اتم»؛ برداشتند؛ همچنین پیشرفتهایی همانند: «لقاح آزمایشگاهی»، «کلونینگ» و «نقشه برداری ژن»، یاری کرده است؛ و توسط میلیاردها انسان خریداری و فروخته شده اند؛ با اینحال «هنریتتا لکس» ناشناخته مانده، و در یک گور نامشخص دفن شده استاین کتاب به بخش‌های: برخورد اخلاق در حرفه پزشکی با نژادپرستی، و محرومیت‌های «تاریخی- اجتماعی» رنگین پوستان، برخورد جنبه‌ های معنوی، و حقوقی مالکیت بافت‌های بدن انسان، به تنگدستی و خرافات‌، و برخورد با اکتشاف‌ها، راهکارها، و شیوه ‌های نوین پزشکی هم پرداخته، و نکاتی خواندنی را پیش روی خوانشگر میگذارد؛ «حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس»: صحبت‌ها، یادمانهای نزدیکان «لکس»، و نگاهی به اسناد قانونی، و پرونده‌های پزشکی ایشان نیز هست؛ نگارنده، در این نوشتار علاوه بر نگارش تاریخچة زندگی «هنریتیا لکس» به معرفی «سلول‌های هیلا» و پاسخ‌گویی به پرسش‌‌هایی درباره ی دانش پزشکی، اخلاق، نژاد، و طبقه‌ بندی اجتماعی نیز، پرداخته استا. شربیانی"
50,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6050722-rachel,5,"Full disclosure: I come to this book from a weirdly fortuitous place. Take my brief, but mind-searing, stint in gynecologic oncology research ca. 2002, which involved a weekly trek to the OR to pick up still-warm tumors, with the women who informedly consented to donate them often open on the table as I did so. Then throw in two years working in a tissue culture hood, two more in a narrative nonfiction book group, and another big chunk of time studying infectious diseases. Mix in interests in social justice, bioethics, the history of science, and mysteries, and you’ve got me primed for some outsized adoration of Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, because its three main narratives are: 1) The history of tissue culture, particularly the contribution of the “immortal,” fabulously prolific HeLa cells that revolutionized medical research.2) The life, disease and death of Henrietta Lacks, the woman whose cervical cancer cells gave rise to the HeLa cell line.3) The story of Henrietta Lacks’s impoverished family, particularly her daughter Deborah, belatedly discovering and coping with their mother’s cellular legacy.Intertwined with all three is the concept of informed consent in scientific research, and who owns those bits of us and our genetic information that are floating around the research world. See? That perfect scientific/bioethical/historical mystery doesn’t come along every day. My expectations for this one were absolutely sky-high. And Rebecca Skloot hit it higher than that pile of 89 zillion HeLa cells. Thing is, my particular background can make reading about science kind of painfully bifurcated. I mean first, you’ve got your books that are all, “Yay! Science is totally objective and awesome and will solve all of our problems, so just shut up and trust it already!!” But then you’ve definitely also got your, “Science is just one (over-privileged and socially influenced) way of knowing among many / Medicine is patriarchal and wicked and economically motivated and pretty much out to get you, so avoid it at all costs” books too.Yes, Skloot could have written the story of a poor, black, female victim of evil white scientists. But she didn’t do that. Given her interests, it’s conceivable she could have written the triumphant history of tissue culture, and the amazing medical breakthroughs made possible by HeLa cells, and thank you for playing, poorblackwomanwhomnobodyknows. But she didn’t do that either. Instead, she spent ten years researching and writing a balanced, multifaceted book about the humans doing the science, the human whose cells made the science possible, and the humans profoundly affected by the actions of both. Her book is a complex tangle of race, class, gender and medicine. Of reason and faith. Of knowledge and ethics. Of the chasm between the beneficiaries of medical innovation and those without healthcare in the good old US of A.And Skloot doesn’t have the answers. We don’t get to tut-tut at how much things sucked in the past, while patting ourselves on the back for living in the enlightened present. This is vital and messy stuff, here. The problems haven’t been fixed. Who owns our pieces is an issue that is very much alive, and, with the current onslaught of new genetic information, becoming livelier by the minute. Which is why I would feel comfortable recommending this book to anyone involved in human-subjects research in any capacity...so a boatload of us, really, whether we know it or not.But, buyer beware: to tackle all this three-pronged complexity, Skloot uses a decidedly non-linear structure, one with a high narrative leaps:book length ratio. The three main narratives unfold together and inform each other: we meet Deborah Lacks, while learning about the fate of her mother, while learning about what HeLa cells can do, while learning about tissue culture innovators, while learning about the fate of Deborah Lacks. And Skloot saves the nuts and bolts of informed consent and the ownership of biological materials for a densely packed Afterward. Me, I found this to be a powerful structure and ate it all up with a spoon, but I can see how it could be a bit frustrating. You should also know that Skloot is in the book. According to Skloot herself, she fought against this for years. But you know what? I think she needs to be there. This is a book about adding the human complexity back into an illusion of objective scientific truth. When the author has become a character in the lives of her subjects, influencing events in their lives, it works to have the author be a textual presence disrupting the illusion of the objective journalistic truth. She only appears when it’s relevant to her subjects’ story; you don’t hear anything about her story that doesn’t pertain to theirs. And having been in that narrative nonfiction book group for two years, Skloot’s stands out as an elegant and thoughtful approach to the author/subject connection (self-reported femme-fatale author of The Angel of Grozny: Orphans of a Forgotten War, I’m looking at you so hard right now.)
This book pairs well with:
 The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures, another excellent, non-judgmental book about the intersection of science, medicine and culture. With The Mismeasure of Man, for more on the fallibility of the scientific process. It would also taste really good with a kick-ass book about the history of biomedical ethics in the United States, so if you know of one, I’d love to hear about it!"
51,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"I am late to this book party, but let me explain: I get twitchy about medical stuff. Earlier this year I had to abandon Rosemary Mahoney's book about the blind because it described an eye surgery. I have never been able to finish Dr. Atul Gawande's Complications because of its description of medical procedures. It was a small miracle that I was able to finish the Call the Midwife series, because I hate childbirth scenes. When this Henrietta Lacks book started tearing up the bestseller lists a few years ago, I read a few reviews and thought, ""Yeah, that can wait.""Then I started a new library job, and the Lacks book was chosen as a Common Read for the campus. Guess who was volun-told to help lead upcoming book discussions? (Hint: it was me.)So, with a deep sigh, I started reading. And then, oh happy day, my fears turned out to be unfounded because I ended up really liking the story. Rebecca Skloot wrote that she first heard about Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells in a community college biology class. Lacks was a black woman who died in 1951 from cervical cancer. Before she died, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. A key part of this story is that Henrietta did not know her tissue had been taken, and doctors did not tell her family.Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in culture for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal cells ever grown in a laboratory.Henrietta's cells, nicknamed HeLa, were given to scientists and researchers around the world, and they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, Parkinson's disease, and they helped with innumerable other medical studies over the decades. At first, the cells were given for free, but some companies were set up to sell vials of HeLa, which became a lucrative enterprise. The reason Henrietta's cells were so precious was because they allowed scientists to perform experiments that would have been impossible with a living human. They cut HeLa cells apart and exposed them to endless toxins, radiation, and infections. They bombarded them with drugs, hoping to find one that would kill malignant cells without destroying normal ones. They studied immune suppression and cancer growth by injecting HeLa cells into immune-compromise rats, which developed malignant tumors much like Henrietta's. If the cells died in the process, it didn't matter -- scientists could just go back to their eternally growing HeLa stock and start over again.Unfortunately, the Lacks family did not know about any of this until several decades after Henrietta had died, and some relatives became very upset and felt betrayed by the doctors at Hopkins. A few threatened to sue the hospital, but never did.There is a lot of biology and medical discussion in this book, but Skloot also tried to learn more about Henrietta's life, and she was able to interview Lacks' relatives and children. Additionally, there is some good discussion on the ethics of taking tissue samples from patients without their consent, and on the problem of racism in health care.""I always have thought it was strange, if our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can't afford to see no doctors? Don't make no sense. People got rich off my mother without us even known about them takin her cells now we don't get a dime. I used to get so mad about that to where it made me sick and I had to take pills. But I don't got it in me no more to fight. I just want to know who my mother was."" -- Deborath Lacks, who was very young when her mother diedMy favorite parts of the book were the stories about Henrietta and the Lacks family, and the discussions on race and ethics in health care. There's no indication that Henrietta questioned [her doctor]; like most patients in the 1950s, she deferred to anything her doctors said. This was a time when 'benevolent deception' was a common practice -- doctors often withheld even the most fundamental information from their patients, sometimes not giving them any diagnosis at all. They believed it was best not to confuse or upset patients with frightening terms they might not understand, like cancer. Doctors knew best, and most patients didn't question that. Especially black patients in public wards. This was 1951 in Baltimore, segregation was law, and it was understood that black people didn't question white people's professional judgment. Many black patients were just glad to be getting treatment, since discrimination in hospitals was widespread.Skloot worked on the book for more than a decade, paying for research trips with student loans and credit card debt. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in medical ethics, biology, or just some good investigative reporting. Favorite Quote""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different."" -- Deborah Lacks"
52,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61753513-christy,5,"I do believe this book must have scored near the top of all books used in college courses these last 5-6 years - from English to history and social sciences, but I wonder how much traction it got in medical school and across the healthcare and medical research fields. It quickly became a ""classic"" because so many issues are covered: race, class, gender, genetics, property rights, and about the social ends of science and our technological choices. As well, it's a story of how some people are used by institutions for other ends, whether admirably or not, and how unjust and unfair it was to Henrietta to have her cancer cells taken without her permission. She died at age 31 from the cancer, yet the gene treatment her cells produced is tremendously useful in the medical field and will be for a long time to come, hence her ""immortal"" status, yet it gives little comfort to the reader. Ironically, her own family now suffers from a lack of access to healthcare.Kudos to author Skloot who started a the Henrietta Lacks Foundation to help families like the Lacks with healthcare and other financial needs, including more victims of similar experiences, including those of the infamous Tuskeegee experiment with treating only some Black soldiers with syphilis. You can check it out at http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/"
53,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020736-stacey,5,"I've started and erased my little book commentary so many times because this story is so overwhelming and so important on multiple levels, I'm not sure anything I could say about it would do justice to the complexity and dichotomy of the story surrounding Henrietta Lacks. It might not be far from the truth to state that she was the most important person who ever lived. A physical part of her body has saved hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of lives, and improved the lives of countless others. And her story is not over yet. Her cells are still being used in medical research all over the world. But these benefits came at the cost of a violation of her rights, in a time when it was commonplace for doctors and researchers to just do and take, without consent, especially among poor populations and people of color. Some of the things done with Henrietta's cells saved lives, some were heinous experiments performed on people who had no idea what was being done to them, in a grotesquely distorted and amplified reflection of what was done to Henrietta. Nuremberg was dismissed in the United States as something that only applied to the fallen Nazi's. Any act was justifiable in the name of science. And yet, some of the things done right her in our own nation were reminiscent of the research being conducted under the direction of the notorious Dr. Mengele.Reading certain parts of this book, I found myself holding my breath in horror at some of the ideas conjured by medical practioners in the name of “research.” Of course, we know.* Anyone who is even moderately informed on this nation's medical history knows about the Tuskegee trials, MK Ultra, flu and hepatitis research on the disabled and incarcerated, radiation exposure experiments on hospital patients, and cancer, cancer, cancer. The poor, disabled and people of color in this country, the “land of the free,” have been subjected to so many cancer experiments, it defies belief. Many of these trials, including some devised of Henrietta's cells, have involved injecting cancer, non-consensually, into human subjects. So while it is true that there can be utterly no doubt that our lives, and the lives of much of the world, are better, because of the knowledge made possible by parts of Henrietta Lacks's body, still acknowledgment of this reality comes at the cost of knowing that procedures were performed on her without her knowledge or understanding, and without her consent, with impunity; these actions were made even easier because she was poor, black and female, and this is to say nothing of the numerous and unethical violations of her (and her children's) privacy. It's an old story. It's a story that her biographer, Rebecca Skloot, handles with grace and compassion. Henrietta is not some medical spectacle, she was a real woman. If she has been deified by her friends and family since her death, it is maybe the homage that she deserves, not for her cells, but for her vibrance, kindness, and the tragedy of a mother who died much too young. There are a great many scientific and historical facts presented in this book, facts that I couldn't possibly vet for veracity, but the science seems sound, if simplistic, and the history is presented in a conversational way, that is easy to read, and uninterrupted by footnotes and references. Family recollections are presented in storyteller fashion, which makes for easy and compelling reading. Fact-checking is made easy by a list of references, presented in chapter-by-chapter appendices. Rarely do I read something that makes me want to collar strangers in the street and tell them, “You MUST read this book,” but this is one of those times. Henrietta's story is bigger than medical research, and cures for polio, and the human genome, and Nuremberg. Henrietta's story is about basic human rights, and autonomy, and love. It's about knowledge and power, how it's human nature to find a way to justify even the worst things we can devise in the name of the greater good, and how we turn our science into a god. This story is bigger than Rebecca Skloot's book. But I am grateful that she wrote it, and thankful to have read it. Would the story have changed had Henrietta been given the opportunity to give her informed consent? That's the thread of mystery which runs through the entire story, the answer to which we can never know. *documentation in this list is inconsistent, but most of these experiments can be independently verified."

55,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,4,"A lot to process with this book. This book's been out for a while, so I'm just going to put down a bunch of thoughts rattling around in my head, and probably leave it at that:-legacy left by slavery and how it affected Henrietta Lacks and the members of her family, and African Americans in general (where they lived, what kind of employment was available to them, the quality of education available to them, the history of abuse and violence, and the impact on their mental health, and the quality and availability of healthcare)-the assumptions and treatment by the medical establishment, at the time, of their patients and patients' rights-the lack of laws, or their lack of clarity, around a patient's consent, and the ownership of a patient's waste products from medical procedures. This was well illustrated in this book, from the 1950s to the time of the book's publication. -the quality of scientific education and knowledge in the general public. Unless people have some understanding of science, how are they to know what questions to ask of their doctors? The more affluent will generally fare better here, I suspect, what with their access to probably better trained teachers, and the ability to get higher education. And affluence and better outcomes would be partially dependent on where one started out in life.-thank goodness medical procedures improve over time, or are retired in favour of treatments that work!!-bioethics--thank goodness there is debate and evolution of ideas and laws. Though there are probably still lots of grey areas around research and commercializations -I was interested to find out more about the point raised about the DNA of the cell descendants of Henrietta's original cancerous cells.-I was sickened by the treatment, or perhaps I should say mystery around the treatment of Elsie, Henrietta's eldest daughter at the hospital for the insane. Or what doctors could call insane at the time.This was a painful read, but an important accounting of a part of US history, and more specifically, the legacy of slavery on a family, and the changing attitudes and practices in medicine and science."
56,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"I am not sure how is it in other countries but here in the Philippines, if you bring your car for repair in a service center and the serviceman says that he replaced a part, you how to do in you should find that replaced part inside your car. I think it is their proof that they actually replaced that part and also for you to decide how you want to dispose, resell, reuse or recycle it. Normally, this practice bothers me because I have a very small space for junks at home and I do not know what to do with a malfunctioning compressor, air vent, axle, mudguard, leaking pipes, tubes, coolant container, etc. What am I going to do with them? The only thing I know w.r.t. car is how to replace the battery or a flat tire. So, I always end up giving those away to the poor junk man so as to have something to load in his pushcart.It may not be the best analogy to introduce a very compelling book like this. However, the logic is the same. The organ, tissue, cells or fluids that you left in the hospital during your last hospitalization or check-up is totally different from the car spare parts. But both are left after you get what you want and you think they are of no use to you anymore. You gave the authorization for the part to be removed and replaced (if possible) and you deserve to have the replaced unit because legally, you are still the owner of the original or replaced part. However, just like me and the car junks, I would imagine that you don't want to bring home with you some test tubes filled with your excess coagulated blood, liquified Chlorox-smelling semen, miniscule torn ligaments or decayed tooth. What are you going to do with them? Henrietta Lacks, a poor black Tobacco farmer, died of cervical cancer in 1951. Without her knowledge, the doctors got her cancerous tissue and tried to use its cells in a cell culture. Surprise. Surprise. Henrietta's cells propagate like wild fire and they are still alive up to now. It was the first successful cell culture since in all the previous attempts, the cells only lived for few days before dying. The book explains that in Henrietta's chromosomes has enzyme called telomerase that continuously rebuils the telomere which is a string of DNA found at the end of each of Henrietta's chromosome. Skloot says in her introduction that there is more to this, as well as other issues, but apologizes for not excluding them in this book's scope. That's fine with me, because the scientific discussions in the book are just enough for me not to fall asleep and lose interest. We all took Biology in high school and the Cell and its parts, how they work, etc is always that's subject's first lesson so I think you can get by.So what if Henrietta's cells are still alive today? Medical discoveries still happen and we don't know or don't care to know their history. Well, those cells have been used to developed vaccines for polio, gene mapping, cloning, etc. So? Well, Henrietta's cancer cells were used without her or her families consent. Henrietta died 2 weeks after being diagnosed with cervical cancer and she was so poor she had to be buried in an unmarked grave. So? Well, Henrietta was black and the doctors were white. In the 50's, America was still not so open with mixing the two colors. The whites probably would not want to have anything in their body taken from a black person. So? This book tackles a number of controversial questions on medical ethics, racism and social discrimination. However, this is not a serious boring book. Skloot's storytelling does not leave any tinge of textbook formality and this can be read just like any A-grade medical crime bestseller that has some sprinklings of family drama (Henrietta's children have to be given away to relatives after her death), incest (10-y/o Rebecca, Henrietta's daughter, escapes a horny uncle showing his erect penis and she does not know the meaning of a rigid penis) and the struggles of a black family despite having a world-renowned mother whose cells, called the HeLa cells, make a unprecedented contribution to the medical field and in prolonging our life expectancy.So? Well, what if the same thing happens to you? What are the chances that your excess semen was not put in the wastebasket but stored in a sperm bank and given away to childless couples for in vitro fertilization of the wife's ovum? Then what if that child becomes the new Einstein? a new Picasso? a new Shakespeare? a new G.G.Marquez? I'm just saying...  "
57,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3893454-christina,4,"This was an interesting read. While I applaud Skloot's attempt to present a fair look at the history of the HeLa cell line used in research labs all over the world, the book is clearly skewed toward sympathy for the family. Not that they don't deserve sympathy, but really, the problems of the family is NOT the fault of anyone involved with the cell line. Don't get me wrong, Henrietta and her family have had a hard life, and they do deserve some sympathy. But not for this particular issue.The sad fact is that Henrietta died of an aggressive cancer, leaving her family to live their lives without her. That was not her fault or the fault of her family, but it was also not the fault of the hospital staff of Johns Hopkins. Yes, there was racial and socio-economic discrimination, but the fact remains that Henrietta was treated to best of the ability of the doctors at that time. Do we view the taking of cell samples from Henrietta without her permission as unethical today? Most people would say yes. But the law still remains unclear about that, and in 1954 that was most certainly not seen as unethical - it was common practice. So in the context of the time, the act was not unethical. As for monetary compensation, Johns Hopkins did not profit from the growth of HeLa cells; in fact, the scientist that first worked with HeLa cells GAVE the cells away to many many many other labs FOR FREE. Those labs shared with other labs, etc. Are there companies that profit from the cells now? Yes. But they got the cells the same way everyone else did back then - for free. The company then did their own research to find a way to mass produce, store and ship living cells. At the point the first company started mass producing and selling the cells the identity of the donor was long hidden, and the fact the cells were widespread at that time made them common property, so people in possession of the cells could do pretty much anything they wanted with them. And now for the part that is a little stickier - the family found out about Henrietta's cells, were (sort of) tricked into donating blood and cell samples and were kept in the dark about the cell line for decades. Was that right? NO, absolutely not. HOWEVER, I will point out that some of the subsequent anger, confusion and fear on the part of the family was due to their extreme lack of education rather than a malicious attempt to prey upon the Lacks family. The science presented in the book is simplified somewhat for the lay person, which is nice, as is the look at the advances in medicine and research that HeLa cells have brought to the world. As a scientist, however, I think that Skloot's explanations were a little fuzzy and did not really dispel most people's image of how science works in the real world. Perhaps a little more objectivity and less family bonding would have made this a better book.In conclusion: though Skloot claims she tries to give an unbiased view of the history of HeLa cells and the family from whence it came, I am concerned that lay people who read this will not understand some of the finer points and it will increase the already rampant fear of science that pervades American culture. The majority of Americans are woefully un-educated in the sciences, to the point that many people view it as no different than magic,but weirder and scarier. "
58,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1431828-nnedi,5,"What a wonderfully told story. Rebecca Skloot really came through on the research. She dug it alllllll up. And the way she told Henrietta's story was beautiful and almost reflective of Henrietta's life. The story started at a point and then spread out to become a story that enveloped all of humanity. I read this as more research on Henrietta for my forthcoming novel THE BOOK OF PHOENIX and it was exactly what I needed and wanted. I wanted the science but I also wanted the close personal narrative of this woman and the people in her life; I wanted the good, the bad and the ugly. This book was all of that. Some of it is lovely, some was disturbing, plenty of it as shocking, and lots of it was heart-breaking. Her story is so deeplyAmerican. Also, it was really cool how close the writer got to the narrative. and eventually became a part of it. I love that. Oh and there's a touch of African magic in the story, which didn't surprise me at ALL, considering what this book was about. <3'd this book!"
59,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer,4,"You know all those forms you have to fill out while waiting at the doctor and dentist office? The tedious, repetitious ones that you could have sworn you already completed at least a thousand times? Next time you sigh loudly or roll your eyes at the prospect of this task, think about the people who came before us who were never offered the luxury of informed consent, confidentiality, and protection from discrimination. Horrendous injustices prompted these forms into action so that history does not repeat itself. It's a sad thought.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks offers historical insight into human rights issues within the medical field. Primarily though, it focuses on the woman behind the most famous and widely researched human cells in the world: Henrietta Lacks. Her name has only recently become known to the world which is quite sad, but thanks to her family's perseverance and Rebecca Skloot's heavy research and publication, the world now knows who to credit with most medical advances to date. It has been reported that Ms. Lacks had no knowledge of her contribution, as she was unaware that tissues were saved after multiple cancer biopsies/treatments, and therefore, she gave no permission for her cells to be used in any way, shape, or form, but Ms. Skloot reminds us that even today, none of us have any say over what is done with our cells and tissues once removed from our bodies. I appreciated Ms. Skloot's attention to Ms. Lacks' remaining family members and their immense struggles in spite of all the progress (and profits) made in the medical field. In my opinion though, she was a bit too forthcoming in regards to the family. Factors related to race, poverty, education, medical issues, disabilities, and access to healthcare are definitely warranted in a book like this to show the overall contrast between those benefiting from Ms. Lacks' contribution and the family that was left behind, along with the insensitivity and injustice of it all. However, criminal histories, superstitions, and mental illness had no place in this book in my opinion. I believe this was potentially harmful to the family's character, and some portions of the book painted the family in a money-hungry and incompetent light which was unnecessary even if that may have been Ms. Skloot's perception or experience. Regardless, the family's inclusion in this book did make all the difference and I thoroughly enjoyed my reading experience. If you'd like to gain some insight into the history of medical/science research along with a look at human/civil rights issues throughout the decades, check out The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks!My favorite quote:""You don't mess with Henrietta — she'll sic HeLa on your ass!"""
60,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"The doorbell rang the other day and when I answered it, there was a very slick guy in a nice suit standing there and a limousine parked at the curb. He started shaking my hand and wormed his way into the house.“Mr. Kemper, I’m John Doe with Dee-Bag Industries Incorporated. I need you to sign some paperwork and take a ride with me. Don’t worry, I’ll have you home in a day or two,” he said. Then he pulled a document out of his briefcase, set it on the coffee table and pushed a pen in my hand. “Wait a second. What the hell is this all about?” I said as I tried to pick up the paper to read it, but Doe kept trying to force my hand with the pen down on it so I couldn‘t see what it said.“Oh, that’s just legal mumbo-jumbo. You’d rather try and read your mortgage agreement than this old thing. Just put your name down and let’s be on our way, shall we?” he said.There was a brief scuffle, but I managed to distract him by messing up his carefully gelled hair. As he shrieked and ran around looking for a mirror, I finally got to read the document.“This is a medical consent form. What’s going on?” I demanded as I shook the paper at him. Once he had combed and smoothed his hair back into perfection, Doe sighed.“Very well, Mr. Kemper. I guess I’ll have to come clean. Do you remember when you had your appendix out when you were in grade school?”“Sure. That gave me one of my better scars, but that was like 30 years ago. Why are you here now?” I asked.“You’re probably not aware of this, but your appendix was used in a research project by DBII,” Doe said.“Really? I assumed it just got incinerated or used in the hospital cafeteria’s meatloaf special. Why would anyone want to study my rotten appendix?”“Oh, all kinds of research is done on tissue gathered during medical procedures. Most people don’t know that, but it’s very common,” Doe said.“OK, but why are you here now?”“Well, your appendix turned out to be very special. It was secreting some kind of pus that no one had seen before. After many tests, it turned out to be a new chemical compound with commercial applications. So a patent was filed based on that compound and turned into a consumer product,” Doe admitted.“That sounds disgusting. What was it used in? Because I want to make sure to never buy it,” I said.“It’s the basis for the adhesive on Post-It Notes,” Doe said.“Are you freaking kidding me? Post-It Notes are based on my old appendix?”“I’m absolutely serious, Mr. Kemper. Now we at DBII need your help. Unfortunately for us, you haven’t had anything removed lately. So I have to get your consent if we’re going to do further studies,” Doe said.“But you already got my goo-seeping appendix. I don’t have another one,” I said. “True, but sales have been down for Post-It Notes lately. So after the marketing and research boys talked it over for a while, they thought we should bring you in for a full body scan. Maybe you’ve got a spleen giving out or something else that we could pull out and see if we could use it,” Doe said.“This is pretty damn disturbing,” I said.“Why? You’re an organ donor, right? Same thing,” Doe said.“I don’t consider someone lucking into an organ if the Chiefs win a play-off game and I have a goddamn heart attack the same thing as companies making money off tissue I had removed decades ago and didn’t know anything about,” I said.“Fortunately, the American government and legal system disagree. So how about it, Mr. Kemper? Will you come with me?” Doe asked.“I dunno. What’s my end of this? You already owe me a fat check for the Post-Its.”“Oh, no. You won’t get any money from the Post-Its, or if any future discoveries from your tissues lead to more gains.” Doe said.“That’s complete bullshit!”“Again, the legal system disagrees with you. But this is for science, Mr. Kemper. You don’t want to hold up medical scientific research that could save lives, do you?”“It’s for Post-It Notes!”“Maybe, but who is to say that the cure for some terrible disease isn't lurking somewhere in your genes? Could you live with yourself if you prevented crucial medical research just because you were ticked off that you didn’t get any money for your appendix? Remember that it’s not like you could have NOT had your appendix removed. At least, not if you wanted to keep living. And I highly doubt that you would have had the resources to have it studied and discovered the adhesive for yourself even if you would have taken it home with you in a jar after it was removed. We’re the ones who spent all that money to get some good out of a piece of disgusting gunk that tried to kill you. So shouldn’t we be compensated? What are you? Some kind of damn dirty hippie liberal socialist?” Doe said in disgust“You’re a hell of a corporate lackey, Doe,” I said.“Thank you.”“Fine. I’ll do it,” I said as I signed the form. “But I want some free Post-It Notes.”“No deal. Steal them from work like everyone else,” Doe said.******Obviously, I‘m a big fat liar and none of this happened, but I really did have my appendix out as a kid. Plus, my tonsils got yanked and I’ve had my fair share of blood taken over the years. What this book taught me is that it’s highly likely that some of my scraps are sitting in frozen jars in labs somewhere. Yours, too. If any of us have anything unique in our tissues that may be valuable for medical research, it’s possible that they’d be worth a fortune, but we’d never see a dime of it.Henrietta Lacks couldn’t be considered lucky by any stretch of the imagination. A black woman who grew up poor on a tobacco farm, she married her cousin and moved to the Baltimore area. Her husband apparently liked to step out on her and Henrietta ended up with STDs, and one of her children was born mentally handicapped and had to be institutionalized. In 1951, Henrietta was diagnosed with cervical cancer by doctors at Johns Hopkins. During her biopsy, cell samples were taken and given to a researcher who had been working on the problem of trying to grow human cells. Henrietta’s cancer spread wildly, and she was dead within a year. But her cells turned out to be an incredible discovery because they continued growing at a very fast rate. The doctor at Johns Hopkins started sharing his find for no compensation, and this coincided with a large need for cell samples due to testing of the polio vaccine. The HeLa cells would be crucial for confirming that the vaccine worked and soon companies were created to grow and ship them to researchers around the world. Since then, Henrietta’s cells have been sent into outer space and subjected to nuclear tests and cited in over 60,000 medical research papersUnfortunately, no one ever asked Henrietta’s permission and her family knew nothing about the important role her cells played in medicine for decades. Poor and with little formal education, Henrietta’s children were confused by what was actually done to their mother and upset when they learned that her tissue was part of a multi-million dollar industry that they‘ve received no compensation from..Rebecca Skloot has written a fascinating book that clearly outlines why Henrietta’s cells were so important, why she went unrecognized for decades, the pain it’s caused her family, and the way that new medical discoveries over the last sixty years have opened a potential Pandora’s Box of legal and ethical issues regarding tissue collection, research, patents and money. This book brings up a lot of issues that we’re probably all going to be dealing with in the future. Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog."
61,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"This is an all-gold five star read.It's actually two stories, the story of the HeLa cells and the story of the Lacks family told by a journalist who writes the first story objectively and the second, in which she is involved, subjectively. The contrast between the poor Lacks family who cannot afford their medical bills and the research establishment who have made millions, maybe billions from these cells is ironic and tragic. It has been established by other law cases that if the family had gone for restitution they would not have got it, but that's a moot point as they couldn't afford a lawyer in any case. I have seen some bad reviews about this book. People who think that the story of the Lacks - poor rural African-Americans who never made it 'up' from slavery and whose lifestyle of decent working class folk that also involves incest, adultery, disease and crime, they just dismiss with 'heard it all before' and 'my family despite all obstacles succeeded so what is wrong with the Lacks?' I wonder if these people who not only totally can't see the wonderful writing that brings these people to life and who so lack in compassion themselves are the sort of people who oppose health care for the masses? As an extremely wealthy American tourist once put it to me, he had earned good health care by his hard work and success in life, it was one of the perks, why waste good money on, say, a a triple-bypass on someone who hasn't even succeeded enough to afford health insurance? That they were a drain on society, non-contributors and not the way America needed to go to move forward.I don't think you can rate people by what they have achieved materially. Success depends a great deal on opportunity and many don't have that. Henrietta Lacks didn't have it and her children didn't have it, not even her grandchildren made much of a way for themselves, but the next generation, the great grandchildren - ah now they are going in for Masters degrees and maybe their children will be major contributors. The author intends to recompense the family by setting up a scholarship for at least one of them. All of us came originally from poverty and to put down those that are still mired in the quicksand of never having enough spare cash to finance an education is cruel, uncompassionate and hardly looking to the future.HeLa cells have given us our future. They are the most researched and tested human cells in existence. All of us have benefited from the medical advances made using them and the book is recognition of what a great contribution Henrietta Lacks and her family with all their donations of tissue and blood, mostly stolen from them under false pretences, have made. Indeed one of the researchers who looks like having told a lot of lies (and then lied about that) in order to get the family to donate blood to further her research is still trying to get them to donate more. She's a hard-nosed scientist, with an excellent job and income and to her the Lacks are no more than providers of raw material. Sometimes you can't make hard and fast rulings. No I don't think we should have to give informed consent for experiments to be done on tissue or blood donated during a procedure or childbirth - that would slow medical research unbearably. I don't think cells should be identifiable with the donor either, it should be quite anonymous (as it now is). However, there is only ever one 'first' in any sphere and that one does deserve recognition and now with the book, some 50 years after her life ended, Henrietta Lacks has it. Good on yer, Rebecca Skloot, you've done a good thing here."

“She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?”
I've moved this book on and off my TBR for years. The truth is that, with few exceptions, I'm generally turned off by the thought of non-fiction. I'm a fan of fictional stories, and I think I've always felt that non-fiction will be dry, boring and difficult to get through. Especially a book about science, cells and medicine when I'm more of a humanities/social sciences kinda girl.But this book... it's just so interesting. It's written in a very easy, journalistic style and places the author into the story (some people didn't like this, but I thought it felt like you were going along for the journey). It's all the interesting bits of science, full of eye-opening and shocking discoveries, but it's also about history, sociology and race.I started reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks while sat next to my boyfriend. Every so often I would unknowingly gasp or mutter ""oh my god"" and he was like ""what? what?"" and I hadn't even realized I'd done it out loud. It's just full of surprises - and every one is true! It uncovers things you almost certainly didn't know about. And it just shows that sometimes real life can be nastier, more shocking, and more wondrous than anything you could imagine.Maybe you've heard of HeLa in passing, maybe you don't know anything about these cells that helped in cancer research, in finding a polio vaccine, in cloning, in gene mapping and discovering the effects of an atom bomb; either way, this tells an incredible and awful story of a poor, black woman in the American South who was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She is given back her humanity, becoming more than a cluster of cells and being shown for the tough, spirited woman she was. From her own family life to the frankly nauseating treatment of black patients in the 1950s, her story emerges.Not only that, but this book is about the injustices committed by the pharmaceutical industry - both in this individual case (how is it that Henrietta's family are dirt poor when she has revolutionized medicine?) and on a larger scale (during the 1950s, many prisoners were injected with cancer as part of medical experiments!). It's hard to believe what so-called ""professionals"" have gotten away with throughout history - things that we generally associate with Nazi death camps.I honestly could not put it down. Maybe because it's not just about science and cells, but is mainly about all of the humanity and social history behind scientific discoveries. Maybe because Skloot is so damn passionate about her subject and that passion is transferred to the reader. Whatever the reason, I highly recommend it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"
63,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"This was a really good book that leaves one with more questions than it answers, especially at this moment with the explosion in investment and growth in health/biotech. A lot of those questions are ones I wouldn't know how to answer myself either. I think it's really important though that we all start grappling with and instituting better processes around things like informed consent. Also really horrible to think about this in larger societal terms, in the context of institutional racism, and the ways in which the Lacks family still is so socioeconomically disadvantaged while private biotechnology companies sell their mother's cells for so much money. I just feel so extremely uncomfortable with that. I think I wouldn't care so much if the cells were just part of the commons, available for free, or extremely cheaply, but to know people are profiting off of it, it really is quite disgusting. I try not to bring my politics to bear here quite too often but this really really makes me feel strongly that commercialization of things in biological research, especially people's biological matter and tissue shouldn't be happening. This whole situation just feels quite perverse honestly and the book left me feeling disheartened. The dual dehumanization of the Lacks family through science and commercialization is horrifying. And I think if we wants things to be better moving forward both need to be addressed, not just one."
64,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"On October 4, 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a thirty-one-year old black woman, died after a gruesome battle with a rapidly metastasizing cancer. During her treatment, the doctors at Johns Hopkins took some cells from her failing body and used them for research. This was not an unusual thing to have done in 1951. But the cells that came from Ms. Lacks’ body were unusual. They had qualities that made them uniquely valuable as research tools. Labeled “HeLa”, Henrietta’s cells were reproduced by the billions over the following sixty years and have been instrumental in experiments across a wide range of biological science. Today, HeLa cells are sold by the vial at impressive prices. Yet, Ms. Lacks’ family has seen not a penny of compensation from the work that has been made possible by their relative’s unique cells. Rebecca Skloot - from Powell'sRebecca Skloot, a science writer with articles published in many major outlets, spent years looking into the genesis of these cells. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells four stories. First is the tale of HeLa cells, and the value they have been to science; second is the life of, arguably, the most important cell “donor” in history, and of her family; third is a look at the ethics of cell “donation” and the commercial and legal significance of rights involved; and fourth is the Visible Woman look at Skloot’s pursuit of the tales. Each story is significant. The contribution of HeLa cells has been huge and it is important to know how these cells came to be so widely used, and what are the characteristics that make them so valuable. Skloot goes into a reasonable level of detail for those of us who do not make our living in a lab coat. She adds information on how cell cultures can become contaminated, and how that impacts completed research. She also offers a description of telomeres, strings of DNA at the end of chromosomes critical to longevity, and key to the immortality of HeLa cells. Fascinating stuff. Henrietta Lacks - From Science And FilmSkloot constructs a biography of Henrietta, and patches together a portrait of the life of her family, from her ancestors to her children, siblings and other relations. It is with a source of pride, among other emotions, that her family regards Henrietta’s impact on the world. Skloot delves into these feelings, and the experiences the Lacks family members have had over the decades with people trying to write about Henrietta, and people trying to exploit their interest in Henrietta for dark purposes.The author had to overcome considerable family resistance before she was able to get them to meet with and ultimately open up to her. She takes us through her process, showing who she talked with, when, and the result of those conversations, what institutions she contacted re locating and gaining access to information about Henrietta and some other family members. Most interesting, and at times frustrating, is her story of how she gained the trust of some, if not all, of the Lacks family. This is like presenting a how-to of her research process, a blow-by-blow description of the way research is done in the real world, and it is very enlightening.The Immortal Tale of Henrietta Lacks has received considerable acclaim. It is all well-deserved. The book is an eye-opening window into a piece of our history that is mostly unknown. It presents science in a very manageable way and gives us plenty to think about the next time we have a blood test or any other medical procedure. This book may not be as immortal as Henrietta’s cells, but it will stay with you for a very long time.The HBO Film airs on April 22, 2017==============================EXTRA STUFF8/8/13 - NY Times article - A Family Consents to a Medical Gift, 62 Years Later3/29/17 - Washington Post - On the eve of an Oprah movie about Henrietta Lacks, an ugly feud consumes the family - by Steve Hendrix"

Strengths:
*Fantastically interesting subject!One woman's cancerous cells are multiplied and distributed around the globe enabling a new era of cellular research and fueling incredible advances in scientific methodology, technology, and medical treatments. This strain of cells, named HeLa (after Henrietta Lacks their originator), has been amazingly prolific and has become integrated into advancements of science around the world (space travel, genome research, pharmaceutical treatments, polio vaccination, etc). *Thought-Provoking Ethical Questions This book makes you ponder ethical questions historically raised by the unfolding sequence of events and still rippling currently. Ex. 1) Informed consent: Henrietta did not provide informed consent (not required in those days). Ex. 2) Genetic rights/non-rights: her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later. Ex. 3) Patents and profits for biologic material: zero profits realized by Henrietta or her descendants; multiple-millions in profits have been realized by individuals and corporations utilizing her genetic material.*Biographical description of Henrietta and interviews with her family.  The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications. We're reading about actual, valuable people and historic events.
Weaknesses:
*Framework: the book is framed around the author's journey of writing the story and her interactions with Henrietta's family. I thought the author got in the way and would have preferred to have to read less of her journey and more coverage of the science involved and its ethical implications. I found myself distinctly not caring how many times the author circled the block or how many trips she made to Henrietta's birthplace.*Lack of Clarity: By mid-point through the book, I was wishing the biographical approach was more refined and focused. The narrative swerved through the author's interest in various people as she encountered them along the way: Henrietta, Henrietta's immediate family, scientists, Henrietta's extended family, a neighborhood grocery store owner, a con artist, Henrietta's youngest daughter, Henrietta's oldest daughter, etc. Everything was a side dish; no particular biography satisfied as a main course.
Bottom Line:
This book won't join my 'to re-read' shelf...but has whetted my appetite for further exploration of this important woman, fascinating topic and intriguing ethical questions.I was left wanting more:-more detail surrounding the science involved, -more coverage of past and present ethical implications-a more refined biography of Henrietta, and -a more focused look at the impact and implications of the HeLa cell strain line on Henrietta's descendants."

A young black mother dies of cervical cancer in 1950 and unbeknownst to her becomes the impetus for many medical advances through the decades that follow because of the cancer cells that were taken without her permission. This book evokes so many thoughts and feelings, sometimes at odds with one another. It is thought provoking and informative in the details and heartbreaking in the rendering of the personal story of Henrietta Lacks. I was madder than hell that people/companies made loads of money on the Hela cell line while some members of the Lacks family didn’t have health insurance . Yet, I am grateful for the research advances that made a polio vaccine possible, advanced cancer research and genetics, and so much more.Rebecca Skloot does a wonderful job of presenting the moral and legal questions of medical research without consent meshing this with the the human side giving a picture of the woman whose cells saved so many lives. We get to know her family, especially her daughter Deborah who worked tirelessly with the author to discover what happened to her mother. This made it all so real - not just a recitation of the facts. The scientific aspects are very detailed but understandable. It was the sections on Henrietta and her family that I wanted to read the most.In 1950 there was “no formal research oversight in the United States.” Years later there are laws on “informed consent “ and how medical research is conducted, and protection of privacy for medical records. Yet even today, there are controversies over the ownership of human tissue. The in depth research over years in writing this book is evident and I believe a heartfelt effort to recognize Henrietta Lacks for her unwitting contribution to medical research."
68,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114573-chelsea,3,"This could have been an incredible book. Henrietta Lacks' story is finally told--and Skloot makes very clear how important Lacks' cells have been to the last 60 years of science and, paradoxically, how much Henrietta and her family suffered because those cells were taken from Henrietta without her consent. But in her effort to contrast the importance and profitability of Henrietta's cells with the marginalization and impoverishment of Henrietta's family, Skloot makes three really big mistakes. First, she's not transparent about her own journalistic ethics, which is troubling in a book about ethics. Did the Lacks family end up benefiting from her book financially? Did all Lacks give permission for their depictions in the book? We never know. Second, Skloot's narration when describing the Lacks family suffering--sexual abuse, addiction, disability, mental illness--lacks sensitivity; it often feels clinical and sometimes even voyeuristic. Again, this is disturbing in a book that concerns the importance of dignity, consent, etc.Finally, Skloot inserts herself into the story over and over, not so subtly suggesting that she is a hero for telling Henrietta's story. Sometimes, it appears that she is making the very offensive suggestion that she, a highly educated unreligious white woman, has healed the Lacks family by showing them science and history."
69,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731872-kathleen,3,"My thoughts on this book are kind of all over the place. I feel for the Lacks family, I really do. It's hard to read about the poverty and lack of education and the cavalier approach towards informed consent in the early days of Johns Hopkins Research Hospital. The fact that the HeLa cell line is the foundation of so much valuable research is rightfully a source of pride for the family of Henrietta Lacks. I don't think they will ever see monetary compensation for their mother's cancer cell line, however. That horse left the barn a long, long time ago.Furthermore, I don't feel the admiration for the author of this book like I think many others do. She wanted to make herself out to be different than all the rest of the people who wrote about the woman behind the HeLa cell line but I only saw the similarities. Yes, she has established a scholarship fund for the descendants of Henrietta Lacks but I got tired of hearing again and again how she financed her research herself. I think the exploitation is there, just prettied up a bit with a lot of self-congratulatory descriptions of how HARD she had to try to talk to the family and how MANY times she called asking for interviews. At times I felt like she badgered them worse than the unethical people who had come before.The sadness of this story is really about the devastation of a family when its unifying force, a strong mother, is removed. Piled on with more sadness about the appalling institutional conditions for mentally handicapped patients (talking about Henrietta Lacks' oldest daughter) back in the 50's and you have tragedy on top of more tragedy."
70,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,4,"This is a very powerful and informative story. Also, with the history of personal freedoms, civil rights, and right to privacy/requiring consent, this is a very important books. I am not sure the details about the science involved in the story will appeal to all. Just the same as how those who are here for the science may be disinterested in the background stories of the people involved. But, if you think you will like one of the other, I don’t think the one you don’t care for will be distracting.With that in mind, I will continue with the statement that it really is two books: the science and the people. First, the background of cell and tissue research in the last 100 years is intriguing and to hear about all of the advances and why Henretta Lacks was key to them is fascinating. Second, the background of not only the Lacks family, but also others who have had their tissues/cells used for research without permission, gives a lot of food for thought. Almost every medical advancement, and many scientific advancements, in the past 60 years are because of Henrietta Lacks. But, questions about the consent she gave, what she understood about her cells being used, and how much the family has benefited are all questioned and discussed. It really hits hard to think that you may have no control over parts of you once they are no longer part of your body. Also, the fiscal and research ramifications of giving people more rights over their body tissue/cells really creates a huge Catch-22. As I had surgery earlier this year that involved some tissue being removed for analysis, it started to make me wonder what I signed on all those forms and if my cells might still be out there being used for research.The only part of the book that kind of dragged for me was the time that the author spent with the family late in the book. After listening to an interview with the author it was surprising to hear that this part of the book may have been her original focus (how the family has dealt with the revelations surrounding the use of their mother’s cells), but to me it kind of dragged and got repetitive. I don’t think it is bad and others may find it interesting, it just was what brought down my interest in the story a little bit.If you like science-based stories, medical-based stories, civil/personal rights history, and/or just love a decent non-fiction, I think this book is very worth checking out."
71,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1992225-liz-nutting,5,"When I was a graduate student in the field of Ethics, one of my favorite pedagogical strategies, as both a teacher and a student, was the case study. A good case study can make an abstract ethical issue more concrete. A really good case study can turn a deeply contentious issue into an opportunity for thoughtfulness and compassion; right and wrong (to the extent that those concepts even belong in the study of ethics) are nuanced by descriptions of circumstances or values or human need that can make it easier to see and hear and believe the ones on the other side(s) of an issue. Often the case studies are hypothetical, or descriptions of actual cases pared to ""just the facts, ma'am,"" without all the possible extenuating circumstances that can shape difficult decisions. For some students, this causes great angst. How could they be asked to make a judgment, especially one that might involve life or death, without knowing all the details? And of course, at the end of the lesson, everyone wants to know what really happened, how things turned out ""in real life."" On those rare occasions when we actually do know something of the outcome, it is clear that knowing what ""really"" happened almost never makes the decision easier, clearer, or less agonizing. And that is what makes The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks so deeply compelling and challenging. It is the rare story of the outcome of a seemingly inconsequential decision by a doctor and a researcher in 1951, one that few at that time would have ever seen as an ethical decision, let alone an unethical one. A researcher studying cell cultures needs samples; a doctor treating a woman with aggressive cervical cancer scrapes a few extra cells of that cancer into a Petri dish for the researcher. The missing cells had no bearing whatsoever on the outcome of the woman's disease, so no harm done. A few weeks later the woman is dead, but her cancer cells are living in the lab. The bare bones ethical issue at stake--whether it is ethically warranted to take a patient's tissues without consent and subsequently use them for scientific and medical research--is even now not a particularly contentious one...yet. Legally, the case law is settled: tissue removed in the course of medical treatment or testing no longer belongs to the patient. It is, in essence, refuse, and one woman's trash is another man's treasure. Ethically, almost all the professional guidelines encourage researchers to obtain consent, but they have no teeth (and most were non-existent in 1951 anyway). In reality, the vast majority of the tissue taken from patients is of limited use. But there are those rare times when a single person's cells have the potential to break open the worlds of science and medicine, to the benefit of millions--and the enrichment of a very few. Such was the case with the cells of cervical cancer taken from Henrietta Lacks at Johns Hopkins University hospital. HeLa cells grew in the lab of George Gey. And grew. And grew, unlike any cell before it. Next, they were carried to a different laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, where Jonas Salk used them to successfully test his polio vaccine, and thus the cancer that had killed Henrietta Lacks directly led to the healing of millions worldwide. Soon HeLa cells would be in almost every major research laboratory in the world. They traveled to Asia to help find a cure for hemorrhagic fever and into space to study the effects of zero gravity on human cells. Even today, almost 60 years after Henrietta's death, HeLa cells are some of the most widely used by the scientific community. With such immeasurable benefits as these, who could possibly doubt the wisdom of Henrietta's doctor to take a tiny bit of tissue? But the ""real"" story is much more complicated. Henrietta Lacks was uneducated, poor and black. Her cancer was treated in the ""colored"" ward of Johns Hopkins. Her death left five children without their mother, to be raised by an abusive cousin. Should any of that matter in weighing the morality of taking tissue from a patient without her consent, especially in light of the benefits? God knows our country's history of medical experimentation on the poor and minority populations is not pretty. Ironically, one of the laboratories researching with HeLa cells in the 1950s was the one at the Tuskegee Institute--at the very same time that the infamous syphilis studies were taking place. In light of that history, Henrietta's race and socioeconomic status can't help but be relevant factors in her particular case. But her children's status? What bearing does that have? According to author Rebecca Skloot, in ethical discussions of the use of human tissue, ""[t]here are, essentially, two issues to deal with: consent and money."" Both become issues for Henrietta's children. The family didn't learn until 1973 that their mother's cells had been taken, or that they'd played such a vital role in the development of scientific knowledge. They spent the next 30 years trying to learn more about their mother's cells. As they learned of the money made by the pharmaceutical companies and other companies as a direct result of HeLa cells, they inevitably asked questions about what share, if any, they were entitled to. As Henrietta's eldest son put it, ""If our mother so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?"" But even more than financial compensation, the family wants recognition--and respect--for their mother. They want the woman behind her contributions acknowledged for who she is--a black woman, a mother, a person with name longer than four letters. And they want to know the mother they never knew, to find out the facts of her death. In the lab at Johns Hopkins, looking through a microscope at her mother's cells for the first time, daughter Deborah sums it up: ""John Hopkin [sic] is a school for learning, and that's important. But this is my mother. Nobody seem to get that."" Would a fully informed Henrietta Lacks have made the decision to give her tissue to George Gey if asked? Would her decision either way have had any affect whatsoever on her children's future lives? We'll never know, of course. But reading the story behind the case study makes these questions far more potent than any ethics textbook can. And as science now unravels the strains of our DNA--thanks in no small part to HeLa--these are no longer inconsequential questions for any of us. Perhaps we, too, like the doctors and scientists who have long studied HeLa, can learn from the case study of Henrietta Lacks. "
72,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-bionic-jean,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is is an extraordinary book. By turns it is shocking, informative and tragic. There is brilliance - but also deep injustice. It is in part an account of the development of genetics, part social commentary, and partly the story of one woman, Henrietta Lacks. She was an African-American woman descended from slaves and one white slave-owner (Lacks), and she lived as many hundreds of black people still did even as late as the 1950's, in poverty in an old slave-cabin - the ""home-house"" - in East Baltimore. And although the events do not always make for easy reading, the author assures us that it is completely non-fiction. Nothing has been invented, nothing exaggerated. The author has done her level best to tell things as they were. Although the name ""Henrietta Lacks"" is comparatively unknown, ""HeLa"" cells are routinely used in scientific experiments worldwide today, and have been for decades. They are the only human cells thought to be scientifically ""immortal"" ie if they are provided with the correct culture and environment they do not die. They were cut from a tumour in the cervix of Henrietta Lacks a few months before she died in 1951; extracted because she had a particular virulent form of cancer. Despite extreme measures taken in the laboratories to protect the cells, human cells had always inevitably died after a few days. HeLa cells though, stayed alive in the petri dish, and proved to be virtually unstoppable, growing faster and stronger than any other cells known.These HeLa cells were used to develop the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilisation and a host of other medical treatments. They were sent on the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity. It is fair to say that they have helped with some of the most important advances in medicine. But there is a terrible irony and injustice in this. The people to benefit from this were largely white people. Henrietta Lacks's family and descendants suffered appalling poverty. Working from dawn to dusk in poisonous tobacco fields was the norm as soon as the children were able to stand. Moving from Virginia's tobacco production to Bethlehem Steel, a boiler manufacturer in South Boston, was little better, as they were then exposed to asbestos and coal. The families had intermingled for generations. Henrietta and Day, her husband, were first cousins, and this was by no means unusual. So the predisposition to illness was both hereditary and environmental. But access to medical help was virtually nil. Most hospitals accepted only whites, or grudgingly admitted so-called ""colored"" people to a separate area, which was far less well funded and staffed. The Lacks family had to travel a long way in order to be treated, and then were not allowed the privilege of proper explanations as to the treatment given - or the tissue samples extracted.At this time unusual cells were taken routinely by doctors wanting to make their own investigations into cancer (which at that time was thought to be a virus) and many other conditions. No permission was sought; none was needed. The Hippocratic oath doctors set such store by dates from the 4th Century BC, and makes no mention of it; neither did the law of the time require it. It was not until 1947, that the subject was raised. Nazi doctors had performed many ethically unsound operations and experiments on live Jews, and during the trials after the war the Nuremberg Code - a 10 point code of ethics - was set up. This states that, ""The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential."" Even then it was advice, not law. Rebecca Skloot says that Howard Jones, the doctor who had originally diagnosed Henrietta Lacks' cancer, said, ""Hopkins, with its large indigent black population, had no dearth of clinical material."" It was clearly a racial norm of the time. In fact to be fair, the white doctors had no real conception that what they were doing had an ethical side. George Gey and his assistants were responsible for isolating the genetic material in Henrietta's cells - an astonishing feat. Gey happily shared the cells with any scientists who asked. The issue of payment was never raised, but the HeLa cells fast became a commodity, and the Lacks's family, who were never consulted about anything, mistakenly assumed until very recently that Gey must have made a fortune out of them. As Henrietta's daughter Deborah said, ""Them white folks getting rich of our mother while we got nothin."" Skloot carefully chronicles some of the most shocking medical stories from these times. The reader infers from her examples that testing on the impoverished and disadvantaged was almost routine. One notorious study was into syphilis and apparently went on for 40 years. It was called the ""Tuskegee study"", and involved thousands of males at varying stages of the disease. At the time it was known that they could be cured by penicillin, but they were not given this treatment, in order that doctors could study the progress of the disease. In this case they were volunteers, but were encouraged by the offer of free travel to the hospital, a free meal when they got there, and the promise of $50 for their families after they died, for funeral expenses. There are many such poignant examples. The author also says that in 1954 thousands of chronically ill elderly people, convicts and even some children, were injected by a Dr. Chester Southam with HeLa cells, basically just to see what would happen. Of course many of them went on to develop cancer. One man who had Hela cells injected in his arm produced small tumours there within days. But the patients were never informed of this, and if they did happen to ask were told they were being ""tested for immunity"". (We are told that Southam was prosecuted for this much later in 1966.) It was not until 1957 that there was any mention in law of ""informed consent."" Confidentially and privacy violation issues came far later.After her death, four of Henrietta Lacks's children, Lawrence, Deborah, Sonny and Joe, were put in the charge of Ethel, a friend of the family who had been very envious of Henrietta. It appears that she was incredibly cruel to the children, hardly ever feeding them until late, after a day's work, when they would be given a meagre crust. She would also drag the youngest one, Joe, out of bed at will, and beat him unmercifully. Joe was only 4 months old when his mother died and grew up to have severe behavioural problems. In fact later on on life, all these children grew to have not only health problems (including all being almost deaf) but a myriad of social problems too - being involved in burglary, assault and drugs - and spent a lot of their lives in prison.One of Henrietta's five children had been put in ""Crownsville Hospital for the Negro Insane"" when she was still tiny, because Henrietta was too ill to care for her any more. The story of this child, which is gradually told through Skloot's text as more of it is revealed, is heart-breaking. It is not clear why Elsie was so slow, but her mental retardation is now thought to be partly due to syphilis, and partly due to being born on the home-house stone floor - which was routine for such families at the time - and banging her head during birth. It was not known what had subsequently happened to Elsie until Skloot's research, but then some records were discovered. A photograph of Elsie shows a miserable child apparently in pain in a distorted position. Apparently brain scans then necessitated draining the surrounding brain fluid. Never mind that the patient might then suffer violent headaches, fits and vomiting for 2-3 months until the fluid reformed; it gave a better picture. Many people had been sent to this institution because of ""idiocy"" or epilepsy; the assumption now is that that they were incarcerated to get them out of the way, and that tests like this, often for research, were routine. Figures from 1955, when Elsie died, showed that at that time the hospital had 2700 patients, which was 800 over the maximum capacity. The ratio of doctors to patients was 1 doctor for 225 patients.Add into this the appalling inhumanity of history where white people used black people for their own ends, and the fears of Henrietta's family and community become inevitable. There had been stories for generations of white-coated doctors coming at dead of night and experimenting on black people. This became confused - or perhaps vindicated - by the Ku Klux Klan. Stories of voodoo, charismatic religious experiences, dire poverty, lack of basic education (one of Henrietta's brothers was more fortunate in that he had 4 years' schooling in total) untreated health problems and the prevailing 1950's attitudes of never questioning the doctor, all fed into the mix resulting in ignorance and occasional hysteria.Much of the first part of this book includes descriptions of scientific research and discoveries; both the theory and practise of how genes were isolated. Alternating with this is the background to the racial tensions, and the history of Henrietta Lacks' ancestry and family. Rebecca Skloot, a science writer, had been fascinated by the potential story since school days, when she first heard of HeLa cells, but nobody seemed to know anything about them. She started this book in her 20's, and spent a decade researching it, financed by credit cards and student loans. As a white woman she was treated with gross suspicion by all Henrietta Lacks's family. Eventually she formed a good relationship with Deborah, but it took a year before Deborah would even speak to her, and Deborah's brothers were very resistant. Several of them were pastors, as was James Pullam, her husband. They believed the Bible literally and had many fears about how Henrietta's cells were used. Deborah herself could not understand how they were immortal. Could her mother's cells feel pain when they were exploded, or infected? Would they develop into half-human half-chicken freaks when they were split and combined with chicken cells? Were there millions of clones all looking like her mother wandering around London? The media worldwide had played its part in adding to these fears, which had been spawned by a genuine ignorance.The interviews with Henrietta's family, and the progress and discoveries Skloot made accompanied by Deborah in the second part of the book, do make the reader uneasy. Indeed parts of these passages read like a trashy novel. Skloot says she wanted to report the conversation verbatim, so the vernacular is reported intact. Fair enough. But there is a lot of, ""Deborah shouted"" or, ""Lawrence yelled"". Of course they did! All of Henrietta's children had severe health problems, probably due to a variety of factors; their environment, upbringing and genetic inheritance. They were all very hard of hearing, so yes, they would shout when amongst themselves. Add to this Skloot's tendency to describe the attributes and appearance of a family member as ""beautiful hazel-nut brown skin"" or ""twinkling eyes"" and there is a whiff of condescension which does not sit well. Does it add anything to this account? Would a description of the author as having ""raven-black hair and full glossy lips"" help? Of course not. The author may feel she is being complimentary; she is not. She is being patronising. But it is difficult to know how else the total incomprehension and ignorance of how a largely white society operated could have been conveyed, other than by this verbatim reportage, even though at worst it comes across as extremely crass, and at best gently humorous.It would be convenient to imagine that these appalling cases were a thing of the past. But the book continues detailing injustices until the date of its publication in 2010. Henrietta's son, Sonny had a quintuple bypass in 2003. Skloot reports, ""The last thing he remembered before falling unconscious under the anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened in medicine."" So far, so good. There was recognition. But Skloot then delivers the final shot, ""Sonny woke up more than $125,500 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery."" As Lawrence (Henrietta's eldest son) says elsewhere, ""It's not fair! She's the most important person in the world and her family [are] living in poverty. If our mother [is] so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""Henrietta's original cancer had in fact been misdiagnosed. It was discovered years later that because she had syphilis, she had the genital warts HPV virus, which does actually invade the DNA. There is an intriguing section on this, as well as the ""HeLa bomb"", where one doctor painstakingly proved to the whole of the scientific community that a lot of their research had been flawed, as HeLa cells were contaminating many of the other cells they had been working with and drawing conclusions from. They were so virulent that they could travel on the smallest particle of dust in the atmosphere, and because Gey had given them so generously, there was no real record of where they had all ended up.Deborah herself always lived in fear of inheriting her mother's cancer. Because of this she readily submitted to tests. Victor McKusick took blood samples, which Deborah believed were for ""cancer tests."" In fact though, Skloot claims, they were for his own research. This is another example of chronic misunderstanding. He knew of the family's mental anguish and the unfair treatment they had had. He thought she understood why he wanted the blood. He gave her an autographed copy of his book - a technical manual on Genetics. Of this, Deborah commented wryly, ""It would have been nice if he'd told me what the damn thing said too."" And again, ""I would like some health insurance so I don't got to pay all that money every month for drugs my mother cells probably helped to make.""In 2001, Skloot tells us, Christoph Lengauer, now the Head of Oncology in one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, said of Henrietta, ""Her cells are how it all started."" And to Deborah, ""Once there is a cure for cancer, it's definitely largely because of your mother's cells.""In 2005 the US government issued gene patents relating to the use of 20% of known human genes, including Alzheimer's, asthma, colon cancer and breast cancer. The injustices however, continue. Pharmaceutical companies, scientists and universities now control what research is done, and the costs of the resulting tests and therapies. An example of how this continues to impede scientific development according to the author is that of the company Myriad Genetics, who hold the patent on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. (These are the genes which are responsible for most hereditary breast cancers.) The company had arbitrarily set a charge of $3000 to have this test, amid furore amongst scientists. They had licensed the use of the test. Anyone who ignored it received a threat of litigation. Eventually in 2009 they were sued by the American Civil Liberties Union, representing a huge number of people including 150,000 scientists for inhibiting research. The commercialisation of human biological materials has now become big business.There seems to have been some attempts at restitution since this book was published, the most recent being in August 2013. There was an agreement between the family and The National Institutes of Health to give the family some control over the access to the cells' DNA code, and a promise of acknowledgement on scientific papers. The committee set to oversee this arrangement will have 6 members, 2 of whom will be members of the family. The wheels have been set in motion.All in all this is an important and startlingly original book by a dedicated and compassionate author. It speaks to every one of us, regardless of our colour, nationality or class. Skloot admitted that it took a long time to decide the structure of the book, in order to include all the important aspects that she wished to. There are three sections: ""Life"", ""Death"" and ""Immortality"", plus an ""Afterword"". The main thrust throughout is clearly the enduring injustice the Lacks family suffered. So perhaps the final words should be Joe's, or (as he changed his name when he converted to Islam in prison), Zakariyya's: ""I believe what them doctors did was wrong. They lied to us for 25 years, kept them cells from us, then they gonna say them things DONATED by our mother. Them cells was stolen! Those fools come take blood from us sayin they need to run tests and not tell us that all these years they done profitized off of her…. You don't lie and clone behind their backs. That's wrong - it's one of the most violating parts of this whole thing….Then doctors say her cells [are] so important and did all this and that to help people. But it didn't do no good for her, and it don't do no good for us. If me and my sister need something, we can't even go and see a doctor cause we can't afford it.""It's too late for some of Henrietta's family. For how many others will it also be too late?"

Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, ""Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."" (Matthew 26:26-28, NIV Bible)From The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks: There's no way of knowing how many of Henrietta's cells are alive today. One scientist estimates that if you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown on a scale, they'd weigh more than 50 million metric tons--an inconceivable number, given that an individual cell weighs almost nothing....Her cells were part of research into the genes that cause cancer and those that suppress it; they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, and Parkinson's disease; and they've been used to study lactose digestion, sexually transmitted diseases, appendicitis, human longevity, mosquito mating, and the negative cellular effects of working in sewers....Like guinea pigs and mice, Henrietta's cells have become the standard laboratory workhorse.(The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, pp. 2-4)Questions:1) Assuming Jesus Christ was speaking literally, please calculate the total mass and volume of the Body of Christ consumed in the period between the Last Supper (c. 30-36 AD/CE) and the present day. Use only estimates for churches and denominations that preach Transubstantiation. Make sure to factor in such estimates as: average mass and volume of the Host and sacramental wine given per recipient, number of recipients per church, number of churches practicing Communion, number of ceremonies per year (approximate), and time elapsed since the Last Supper. Remember to SHOW YOUR WORK.2) Compare the Body of Christ to the Body of Henrietta Lacks. Is the size of the first greater than, lesser than, or equal to, the second?3) Compare growth rates and determine which is greater:a) Your answer in Question #1 over the past 1,980 years (approximate), orb) HeLa's growth since 1951Essay question:Does size really matter? If, in fact, the Body of Henrietta Lacks were larger than the Body of Christ, would that make her worthy of her own religion?Bonus:Pretend you are a prophet of this new religion. Explain the central tenants of HeLaism. Use your imagination, and have fun!"

But what happens when her biological material generates billions of dollars for the drug and pharmaceutical industry, leaving her dirt poor descendants in the lurch?Yeah, I know I wrote that like the teaser for one of my mysteries but the only mystery here is how people who have profited from the diseased cells that killed a woman can sleep at night while her kids and grand kids don't have two nickels to rub together.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is really two stories. One of Henrietta Lacks and her cancer cells that lived decades beyond her years, and the other of Rebecca Skloot and the surviving members of the Lacks family.Henrietta Lacks married her counsin, contracted multiple STD's due to his philandering ways, and died of misdiagnosed cervical cancer by the time she was 30. However, the cancer that killed her survives today in the form of HeLa cells, which have been taken to the moon, exposed to every manner of radiation and illness, and all sorts of other experiments. While other people are raking in money due to the HeLa research, the surviving Lacks family doesn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of, bringing me to the real meat of the book: The pharmaceutical industry is a bunch of dickbags. Imagine having something removed that generated billions of dollars of revenue for people you've never met and still needing to watch your budget so you can pay your mortage. Fair? Shit no, but that's the way it is, apparently. It also seems illogical that you can patent things you didn't create but again, that's the way the cookie crumbles.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an eye-opening look at someone most of us have never heard of but probably owe some sort of debt to. Also, it drags the big money pharma companies out in the sun. Sadly, they do not burst into flames like the vampires they are. Four out of five stars. I'm going to go read something happy now."
75,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,5,"The gift of life is surely the greatest gift of all. So how can the story of the remarkable woman who gave that gift over and over again to millions of people have been overlooked for so long?In 1951 a poor African American woman in Maryland became an uninformed donor to medical science. Henrietta Lacks died at age 31 of cervical cancer at John Hopkins hospital in Baltimore. Then doctors discovered that tumor cells they had removed from her body earlier continued to thrive in the lab - a medical first.Before long, her cells, dubbed HeLa cells, would be used for research around the world, contributing to major advances in everything from cancer treatments to vaccines; from aging to the life cycle of mosquitoes; nuclear bomb explosions to effect of gravity on human tissue during flights to outer space. An estimated 50 million metric tons of her cells were reproduced; thousands of careers have been build, and initiated more than 60 000 scientific studies until now, but Henrietta Lacks never gave permission for that research, nor had her family.In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca Skloot gracefully tells the story of the real woman and her descendants; the history of race-related medical research, including the role of eugenics; the struggles of the Lacks family with poverty, politics and racial issues; the phenomenal development of science based on the HeLa cells, in a language that can be understood by everyone. She combined the family's story with the changing ethics and laws around tissue collection, the irresponsible use of the family's medical information by journalists and researchers and the legislation preventing the family from benefiting from it all.COMMENTSI was gifted this book in December but never realized the impact it had internationally, neither would have on me. Until I finished reading it last night, I did not know it was an international bestseller, as well as read by so many of my GR friends! It was total surprise, since nonfiction is normally not a regular star on bestseller lists, right?The debate around the moral issue, and the experiences of the poor family were very well presented in the book, which was truly well written and objective as far as possible. For me personally, the question of how this woman, who basically saved millions of people's lives, were overlooked, is answered in the arrogance of scientists who deemed it unnecessary to respect the rights of people unable to fend for themselves.The ethical and moral dilemmas it created in America, when the family became aware of their mother's contribution to science without anyone's knowledge or consent, just enabled the commercial enterprises who benefited massively from her cells, to move to other countries where human rights are just a faint star in a unlimited universe. The Lacks family drew a line in the sand of how far people must be exploited in America. Unfortunately the medical fraternity just moved their operations elsewhere.Tissue and organ harvesting thrive in the world, it is globally a massive industry, with the poorest of the poor still the uninformed donors. An open secret. There are numerous stories, especially in India, where people wake up and realize they were operated on and one of their organs is missing. Stolen. By the time they became aware of it, the organ had already been transplanted in America and elsewhere in the world. That's no secret. Everything is justified as long as science is involved.  Nowadays people in other parts of the world sell their organs, even though it is illegal in most countries. According to American laws people cannot sell their tissue, which is part of human organs? People can donate it though, then it is acceptable.Yet someone else can patent your cells, but you're not allowed to be compensated, since the minute it leaves your body, it is regarded as waste, disposed of, and therefor not deemed your 'property' anymore. Huh?This book was a good and necessary read. The human interest side of it, telling the story of the family was eye-opening and excellent. A little bit of melodramatic, but how else would it become a bestseller, if ordinary readers like us could not relate to it. It was very well-written indeed. Thanks to Rebecca Skloot, in 2010, sixty years later, HeLa now has a history, a face and an address. Finally, Henrietta Lacks, and not the anonymous HeLa, became a biological celebrity. In 1951 Dr. Grey's lab assistant handled yet just another tissue sample of hundreds, when she received Henrietta's to prepare for research. She named it HeLa(first two letters of the patient's name and last name). But a few months later she visited the body of the deceased Henrietta Lacks in the mortuary to collect more samples. When she saw the woman's red-painted toenails, a lightbulb went on.Mary Kubicek: “Oh jeez, she’s a real person. . . . I started imagining her sitting in her bathroom painting those toenails, and it hit me for the first time that those cells we’d been working with all this time and sending all over the world, they came from a live woman. I’d never thought of it that way.”John Hopkins hospital could have considered naming a wing of their research facilities after Henrietta Lack. Why don't they?Nevertheless, this book should be read by everybody. Without it the world would have been a lot poorer and less human.The world has a lot to answer for.RECOMMENDED for sure!EDIT I googled the Lacks family and landed upon the website of the Lacks Foundation, which was started by Rebecca Skloot. http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/That news TOTALLY made my day. I wish them all the best and hope they will succeed in their goals and dreams. A wonderful initiative. Just imagine what can be accomplished if every single person, organization, research facility and medical company who benefitted for Henrietta Lacks's tissue cells, donate only $1 (one single dollar)? Yes, just imagine that!So many positive things happened to the family after the book was published. It just brings tears of joy to my eyes.http://www.lacksfamily.net/index.phpAnd finally: May 29, 2010A Historic Day: Henrietta Lacks’s Long Unmarked Grave Finally Gets a Headstonethanks to Dr. Roland Pattillo at Morehouse School of Medicine, who donated a headstone after reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks."
76,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,5,"There are some books that I finish and am left in awe, questioning everything that I thought I knew on a subject. Or, as is the case hear, having learned so much about which I knew nothing. My jaw is still on the floor after I finished this book and I can only imagine the controversies and discussions it might provoke. A thank you goes out to three Goodreads friends who recommended that I read this book and open an avenue for discussion. Aven, Brenda, and Rae, I hope we can begin a wild and intriguing dialogue, pulling others into the mix as things gain momentum.Who was Henrietta Lacks? What are HeLa cells? These are two of the foundational questions that Rebecca Skloot sought to answer in this poignant biographical piece. While I have tackled a number of biographies in my time as a reader, Skloot offered a unique approach to the genre in publication. Henrietta Lacks grew up in rural Virginia, picking tobacco and made ends meet as best she could. After marrying, she had a brood of children, including two of note, Elsie and Deborah, whose significance becomes apparent as the reader delves deeper into the narrative. Skloot offered up a succinct, but detailed narrative of how Lacks found an unusual mass inside her and was sent from her doctor to a specialist at Johns Hopkins (yes, THAT medical centre) for treatment. The mass was malignant and Lacks was deemed to have cervical cancer. Her surgeon, following the precedent of many doctors in the early 1950s, took samples of her tumour as well as that of the healthy part of her cervix, hoping to be able to have the cells survive so they could be analysed. Past attempts by doctors and scientists failed to keep cells alive for very long, which led to the constant slicing and saving technique used by those in the medical profession, when the opportunity arose. As it turns out, Lacks' cells were not only fascinating to explore, but George Gey (Head of Tissue Culture Research at Johns Hopkins) noticed that they lasted indefinitely, as long as they were properly fed. Gey realised that he had something on his hands and tried to get approval from the Lacks family, though did so in an extremely opaque manner. After Lacks succumbed to the cancer, doctors sought to perform an autopsy, which might allow them complete access to Lacks' body. Ignorant of what was going on, Henrietta's husband agreed, thinking that this was only to ensure his children and subsequent generations would not suffer the agony that cancer brought upon Henrietta. So began the conniving and secretive nature of George Gey. He harvested these 'special cells' and named them ""HeLa"", a brief combination of the original patient's two names. Their phenomenal growth and sustainability led him to ship them all over the country and eventually the world, though the Lacks family had no idea this was going on. HeLa cells were studied to create a polio vaccine (Jonas Salk used them at the University of Pittsburgh), helped to better understand cellular reactions to nuclear testing, space travel, and introduction of cancer cells into an otherwise healthy body during curious and somewhat inhumane tests on Ohio inmates. During all this, Johns Hopkins remained completely aware of what was going on and the transmission of HeLa cells around the globe, though did not think to inform the Lacks family, perhaps for fear that they would halt the use of these HeLa cells. Through the use of the term 'HeLa' cells, no one was the wiser and no direct acknowledgement of the long-deceased Henrietta Lacks need be made. Skloot provided much discussion about the uses, selling, 'donating', and experimenting that took place, including segments of the scientific community in America that were knowingly in violation of the Nuremberg Rules on human experimentation, though they danced their own legal jig to get around it all. The crux of the biography lay on this conundrum, though it would only find its true impact by exploring the lives of those Henrietta Lacks left behind after her death.Skloot took the time to pepper chapters with the history of the Lacks family as they grew up and, eventually, what happened when they were made aware that the HeLa cells existed, over two decades after they were obtained and Henrietta had died. Skloot split this other biographical piece into two parts, which eventually merge into one, documenting her research trips and interviews with the family alongside the presentation of a narrative that explores the fruits of those sit-down interviews. That Skloot tried to remain somewhat neutral is apparent, though through her connection to Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah, there was an obvious bias that developed. Superimposing these two narratives would, hopefully, offer the reader a chance to feel a personal connection to the Lacks family and the struggles they went through. In her discussions of the Lacks family, Skloot pulled no punches and presented the raw truths of criminal activity, abuse, addiction, and poverty alongside happy gatherings and memories of Henrietta. No biographical piece would be complete if it were only window dressing and trying to paint a rosy picture of this maligned family without offering at least a little peek into their daily lives. However, it balanced out and Skloot ended up with what the reader might call a decent introduction to this run of the mill family unit. Their ire at being duped by Johns Hopkins was apparent, alongside the dichotomy that HeLa cells were so popular, yet the family remained in dire poverty in the poor areas of Baltimore.The legal ramifications of HeLa cell usage was discussed at various points in the book, though there was no firm case related to it, at least not one including the Lacks family. One person I know sought to draw parallels between the Lacks situation and that of Carrie Buck, as illustrated wonderfully in Adam Cohen's book, Imbeciles (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...). While the courts surely fell short in codifying ownership of cells and research done on them, the focus of Skloot's book was the social injustice by Johns Hopkins, not the ineptitude of the US Supreme Court, as Cohen showed while presenting Buck v. Bell to the curious audience. While George Gey vowed that he gave away the HeLa cell samples to anyone who wanted them, surely the chain reaction and selling of them in catalogues thereafter allowed someone to line their pockets. Skloot offers up numerous mentions from the family, usually through Deborah, that the Lacks family was not seeking to get rich off of this discovery of immortal cells. While companies were spending millions and profiting billions from the early testing of HeLa cells, no one in the family could afford to see a doctor or purchase the medicines they needed (all of which came about because of tests HeLa cells facilitated!). It is both fascinating and angering to see the system wash their hands of the guilt related to immoral collecting and culturing of these HeLa cells. Skloot did explore the slippery slope of cells and tissue as discarded waste, as well as the need for consent in testing them, something the reader ought to spend some time exploring once the biographical narrative ends. It is sure to confound and confuse even the most well-grounded reader.The latter chapters touched upon the aptly used word from the title ""Immortal"" as it relates to Henrietta Lacks. Be it a biography that placed a story behind the woman, a detailed discussion of how the HeLa cell came into being and how its presence is all over the medical world, or that medical advancements as we know them will allow Henrietta Lacks' being to live on for eternity, the reader can reflect on which rationale best suits them. While there is a religious undertone in the biography as it relates to this, Christianity is not inculcated into the reader's mind, as it was not when Skloot learned about these things.Do I know Henrietta Lacks any better now, after Skloot completed her work? Most definitely! Can I, a complete scientific dunce, better understand HeLa cells and the idea behind cell growth and development? Completely! Do I feel there was an injustice done to the Lacks family by Johns Hopkins in 1951 and for decades to come? Yes, I do harbour a strong resentment to the duplicitous attitude undertaken by a hospital whose founder sought to ensure those who could not receive medical care on their own be helped and protected. Is there a lingering legal argument to be made for compensatory damages or at least some fiduciary responsibility owed to the Lacks family? That is a very grey area for me, only further complicated by the legal discussions in the Afterward and the advancement of new and complicated scientific discoveries, which also bore convoluted legal arguments. I will say this... Skloot brought Henrietta Lacks to life and if that puts a face to those HeLa cells, perhaps all those who read this book will think twice about those medicines used in their bodies and the scientific breakthroughs that are attributed to many powerful companies and/or nations. Maybe then, Henrietta can live on in all of us, immortal in some form or another.Kudos, Madam Skloot for intriguing someone whose scientific background is almost nil. You brought numerous stories to life and helped me see just how powerful one woman can be, silenced by death and the ignorance of what those around her were doing.Like/hate the review?

Her story is a heartbreaking one, but also an important one as her cancer cells, forever to be known as HeLa taken without her consent or knowledge, saved thousands of lives.Through ten long years of investigative work by this author, this narrative explores the experimental, racial and ethical issues of HeLa (the cells that would not die), while intertwining the story of her children's lives and the utter shock of finding out about their mother's cells more than twenty years later.""Physician Seeks Volunteers For Cancer Research."" Yeah, right........So many parts of this book made me sick to my stomach.....like the uncaring treatment of animals and all the poor souls injected with cancer cells without their knowledge in the name of research and greed; and oh, dam Ethel for the inhumane and brutal abuse to Henrietta's children too. Unbelievable!Whew! I must admit to being glad when I turned the last page on this one, but big time kudos to Rebecca Skloot for researching and telling Henrietta's story. She deserved so much better."
78,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,4,"Overall, a four star read that should probably be required reading for both biology and American history classes. (Actually, it was a far more interesting read than that makes it sound). While I had heard a great deal of buzz on the book, I wasn't prepared for how the story evolved. The book alternates between Henrietta Lacks' personal history, that of her family, a little of medical history and Skoot's actual pursuit of the story, which helps develop the story in historical context. Skoots included a lot more science than I expected, and even with ten years in the medical field, I was horrified at times. Skoots does a decent job of maintaining a journalistic tone, but some of the things she relates are terrible, from the way Henrietta grew up to cervical cancer treatment in the 50s and 60s. These were the days before cancer treatments approached the precision medicine it is aiming for today, and the treatments resembled nothing so much as trying to cut fingernails with garden shears. Just the thought of a radioactive seed tucked in the uterus causing tissue burn was enough to give me sympathetic cramps.Part of the evil in the book is the violence her family inflicted on each other, and it's one of the truly uncomfortable areas. I think that discomfort is important, because part of where this story comes from has to do with slavery and poverty. There isn't really an ethical high ground here, and that's part of Skoot's skill in setting up the story, and part of the problem in being a white woman telling the story of a black woman. The only reason I didn't give this a five star rating is that the narrative started to fall apart at the end, leaving behind the stories of the cell line and focus more on the breakdown of Henrietta's daughter, Deborah. While I understand she is the touchstone for the story, that she is partly telling the story of the mother through the daughter, much of Henrietta and the science is sidelined.Interesting questions popped up while reading; namely, why does everyone equate Henrietta's cancer cells with her person? As an illustration, if you tell people they have a cancerous tumor, the reaction is ""get rid of it."" It is categorized as ""other"" in everyone's mind and not recognized it as an intrinsic part of the person with cancer. It is not ""them."" Biologically speaking, I'm not sure the book answered the question of whether of not the HeLa cells actually were genetically identical to Henrietta, or if they were mutated--altered DNA. While that might be cold comfort, it's a huge philosophical and scientific question that is the pivot point for a number of issues. Treating the cells as if they were ""normal"" is part of what lead the scientists into disaster as evidenced by the discovery that so many cell lines were HeLa contaminated (I don't believe that transmission mechanism was explained either, which irks me). It also could be the basis for a sophisticated legal and ethical argument."

Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead in 1951. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سی و یکم ماه آگوست سال 2014 میلادیعنوان: حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس؛ نویسنده: ربکا اسکلاوت (اسکلوت)؛ مترجم: حسین راسی؛ تهران آرامش‏‫، 1390؛ در 426ص؛ شابک 9789649219165؛ موضوع: هنرییتا لکس از سال 1920م تا 1951م؛ بیماران و سرطان - اخلاق پزشکی - کشت یاخته ها - آزمایش روی انسان - سده 21م‬زندگینامه ی بیماری به نام «هنرییتا لکس» است، نامش «هنریتا لکس» بود، اما دانشمندان ایشان را با نام «هلا» میشناسند؛ یک کشاورز تنباکوی فقیر جنوب بود، که در همان سرزمین اجداد برده ی خود، کار میکردند، اما سلولهایش - که بدون آگاهی ایشان گرفته شده - به یکی از مهمترین ابزارهای پزشکی تبدیل شد؛ نخستین سلولهای «جاودانه»ی انسانی که، رشد یافته اند، و امروز هنوز هم زنده هستند، اگرچه ایشان در سال 1951میلادی درگذشته اند؛ اگر بتوانیم همه ی سلولهای «هلا» را که تکثیر شده اند، وزن کنیم، شاید وزن آنها به بیش از پنجاه میلیون تن برسد؛ سلولهای «هلا» برای ایجاد «واکسن فلج اطفال» حیاتی بودند؛ سلولهای ایشان، پرده از اسرار «سرطان»، «ویروسها» و اثرات «تشعشعات بمب اتم»؛ برداشتند؛ همچنین پیشرفتهایی همانند: «لقاح آزمایشگاهی»، «کلونینگ» و «نقشه برداری ژن»، یاری کرده است؛ و توسط میلیاردها انسان خریداری و فروخته شده اند؛ با اینحال «هنریتتا لکس» ناشناخته مانده، و در یک گور نامشخص دفن شده استاین کتاب به بخش‌های: برخورد اخلاق در حرفه پزشکی با نژادپرستی، و محرومیت‌های «تاریخی- اجتماعی» رنگین پوستان، برخورد جنبه‌ های معنوی، و حقوقی مالکیت بافت‌های بدن انسان، به تنگدستی و خرافات‌، و برخورد با اکتشاف‌ها، راهکارها، و شیوه ‌های نوین پزشکی هم پرداخته، و نکاتی خواندنی را پیش روی خوانشگر میگذارد؛ «حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس»: صحبت‌ها، یادمانهای نزدیکان «لکس»، و نگاهی به اسناد قانونی، و پرونده‌های پزشکی ایشان نیز هست؛ نگارنده، در این نوشتار علاوه بر نگارش تاریخچة زندگی «هنریتیا لکس» به معرفی «سلول‌های هیلا» و پاسخ‌گویی به پرسش‌‌هایی درباره ی دانش پزشکی، اخلاق، نژاد، و طبقه‌ بندی اجتماعی نیز، پرداخته استا. شربیانی"
80,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6050722-rachel,5,"Full disclosure: I come to this book from a weirdly fortuitous place. Take my brief, but mind-searing, stint in gynecologic oncology research ca. 2002, which involved a weekly trek to the OR to pick up still-warm tumors, with the women who informedly consented to donate them often open on the table as I did so. Then throw in two years working in a tissue culture hood, two more in a narrative nonfiction book group, and another big chunk of time studying infectious diseases. Mix in interests in social justice, bioethics, the history of science, and mysteries, and you’ve got me primed for some outsized adoration of Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, because its three main narratives are: 1) The history of tissue culture, particularly the contribution of the “immortal,” fabulously prolific HeLa cells that revolutionized medical research.2) The life, disease and death of Henrietta Lacks, the woman whose cervical cancer cells gave rise to the HeLa cell line.3) The story of Henrietta Lacks’s impoverished family, particularly her daughter Deborah, belatedly discovering and coping with their mother’s cellular legacy.Intertwined with all three is the concept of informed consent in scientific research, and who owns those bits of us and our genetic information that are floating around the research world. See? That perfect scientific/bioethical/historical mystery doesn’t come along every day. My expectations for this one were absolutely sky-high. And Rebecca Skloot hit it higher than that pile of 89 zillion HeLa cells. Thing is, my particular background can make reading about science kind of painfully bifurcated. I mean first, you’ve got your books that are all, “Yay! Science is totally objective and awesome and will solve all of our problems, so just shut up and trust it already!!” But then you’ve definitely also got your, “Science is just one (over-privileged and socially influenced) way of knowing among many / Medicine is patriarchal and wicked and economically motivated and pretty much out to get you, so avoid it at all costs” books too.Yes, Skloot could have written the story of a poor, black, female victim of evil white scientists. But she didn’t do that. Given her interests, it’s conceivable she could have written the triumphant history of tissue culture, and the amazing medical breakthroughs made possible by HeLa cells, and thank you for playing, poorblackwomanwhomnobodyknows. But she didn’t do that either. Instead, she spent ten years researching and writing a balanced, multifaceted book about the humans doing the science, the human whose cells made the science possible, and the humans profoundly affected by the actions of both. Her book is a complex tangle of race, class, gender and medicine. Of reason and faith. Of knowledge and ethics. Of the chasm between the beneficiaries of medical innovation and those without healthcare in the good old US of A.And Skloot doesn’t have the answers. We don’t get to tut-tut at how much things sucked in the past, while patting ourselves on the back for living in the enlightened present. This is vital and messy stuff, here. The problems haven’t been fixed. Who owns our pieces is an issue that is very much alive, and, with the current onslaught of new genetic information, becoming livelier by the minute. Which is why I would feel comfortable recommending this book to anyone involved in human-subjects research in any capacity...so a boatload of us, really, whether we know it or not.But, buyer beware: to tackle all this three-pronged complexity, Skloot uses a decidedly non-linear structure, one with a high narrative leaps:book length ratio. The three main narratives unfold together and inform each other: we meet Deborah Lacks, while learning about the fate of her mother, while learning about what HeLa cells can do, while learning about tissue culture innovators, while learning about the fate of Deborah Lacks. And Skloot saves the nuts and bolts of informed consent and the ownership of biological materials for a densely packed Afterward. Me, I found this to be a powerful structure and ate it all up with a spoon, but I can see how it could be a bit frustrating. You should also know that Skloot is in the book. According to Skloot herself, she fought against this for years. But you know what? I think she needs to be there. This is a book about adding the human complexity back into an illusion of objective scientific truth. When the author has become a character in the lives of her subjects, influencing events in their lives, it works to have the author be a textual presence disrupting the illusion of the objective journalistic truth. She only appears when it’s relevant to her subjects’ story; you don’t hear anything about her story that doesn’t pertain to theirs. And having been in that narrative nonfiction book group for two years, Skloot’s stands out as an elegant and thoughtful approach to the author/subject connection (self-reported femme-fatale author of The Angel of Grozny: Orphans of a Forgotten War, I’m looking at you so hard right now.)
This book pairs well with:
 The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures, another excellent, non-judgmental book about the intersection of science, medicine and culture. With The Mismeasure of Man, for more on the fallibility of the scientific process. It would also taste really good with a kick-ass book about the history of biomedical ethics in the United States, so if you know of one, I’d love to hear about it!"
81,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"I am late to this book party, but let me explain: I get twitchy about medical stuff. Earlier this year I had to abandon Rosemary Mahoney's book about the blind because it described an eye surgery. I have never been able to finish Dr. Atul Gawande's Complications because of its description of medical procedures. It was a small miracle that I was able to finish the Call the Midwife series, because I hate childbirth scenes. When this Henrietta Lacks book started tearing up the bestseller lists a few years ago, I read a few reviews and thought, ""Yeah, that can wait.""Then I started a new library job, and the Lacks book was chosen as a Common Read for the campus. Guess who was volun-told to help lead upcoming book discussions? (Hint: it was me.)So, with a deep sigh, I started reading. And then, oh happy day, my fears turned out to be unfounded because I ended up really liking the story. Rebecca Skloot wrote that she first heard about Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells in a community college biology class. Lacks was a black woman who died in 1951 from cervical cancer. Before she died, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. A key part of this story is that Henrietta did not know her tissue had been taken, and doctors did not tell her family.Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in culture for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal cells ever grown in a laboratory.Henrietta's cells, nicknamed HeLa, were given to scientists and researchers around the world, and they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, Parkinson's disease, and they helped with innumerable other medical studies over the decades. At first, the cells were given for free, but some companies were set up to sell vials of HeLa, which became a lucrative enterprise. The reason Henrietta's cells were so precious was because they allowed scientists to perform experiments that would have been impossible with a living human. They cut HeLa cells apart and exposed them to endless toxins, radiation, and infections. They bombarded them with drugs, hoping to find one that would kill malignant cells without destroying normal ones. They studied immune suppression and cancer growth by injecting HeLa cells into immune-compromise rats, which developed malignant tumors much like Henrietta's. If the cells died in the process, it didn't matter -- scientists could just go back to their eternally growing HeLa stock and start over again.Unfortunately, the Lacks family did not know about any of this until several decades after Henrietta had died, and some relatives became very upset and felt betrayed by the doctors at Hopkins. A few threatened to sue the hospital, but never did.There is a lot of biology and medical discussion in this book, but Skloot also tried to learn more about Henrietta's life, and she was able to interview Lacks' relatives and children. Additionally, there is some good discussion on the ethics of taking tissue samples from patients without their consent, and on the problem of racism in health care.""I always have thought it was strange, if our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can't afford to see no doctors? Don't make no sense. People got rich off my mother without us even known about them takin her cells now we don't get a dime. I used to get so mad about that to where it made me sick and I had to take pills. But I don't got it in me no more to fight. I just want to know who my mother was."" -- Deborath Lacks, who was very young when her mother diedMy favorite parts of the book were the stories about Henrietta and the Lacks family, and the discussions on race and ethics in health care. There's no indication that Henrietta questioned [her doctor]; like most patients in the 1950s, she deferred to anything her doctors said. This was a time when 'benevolent deception' was a common practice -- doctors often withheld even the most fundamental information from their patients, sometimes not giving them any diagnosis at all. They believed it was best not to confuse or upset patients with frightening terms they might not understand, like cancer. Doctors knew best, and most patients didn't question that. Especially black patients in public wards. This was 1951 in Baltimore, segregation was law, and it was understood that black people didn't question white people's professional judgment. Many black patients were just glad to be getting treatment, since discrimination in hospitals was widespread.Skloot worked on the book for more than a decade, paying for research trips with student loans and credit card debt. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in medical ethics, biology, or just some good investigative reporting. Favorite Quote""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different."" -- Deborah Lacks"

It quickly became a ""classic"" because so many issues are covered: race, class, gender, genetics, property rights, and about the social ends of science and our technological choices. As well, it's a story of how some people are used by institutions for other ends, whether admirably or not, and how unjust and unfair it was to Henrietta to have her cancer cells taken without her permission. She died at age 31 from the cancer, yet the gene treatment her cells produced is tremendously useful in the medical field and will be for a long time to come, hence her ""immortal"" status, yet it gives little comfort to the reader. Ironically, her own family now suffers from a lack of access to healthcare.Kudos to author Skloot who started a the Henrietta Lacks Foundation to help families like the Lacks with healthcare and other financial needs, including more victims of similar experiences, including those of the infamous Tuskeegee experiment with treating only some Black soldiers with syphilis.

83,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020736-stacey,5,"I've started and erased my little book commentary so many times because this story is so overwhelming and so important on multiple levels, I'm not sure anything I could say about it would do justice to the complexity and dichotomy of the story surrounding Henrietta Lacks. It might not be far from the truth to state that she was the most important person who ever lived. A physical part of her body has saved hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of lives, and improved the lives of countless others. And her story is not over yet. Her cells are still being used in medical research all over the world. But these benefits came at the cost of a violation of her rights, in a time when it was commonplace for doctors and researchers to just do and take, without consent, especially among poor populations and people of color. Some of the things done with Henrietta's cells saved lives, some were heinous experiments performed on people who had no idea what was being done to them, in a grotesquely distorted and amplified reflection of what was done to Henrietta. Nuremberg was dismissed in the United States as something that only applied to the fallen Nazi's. Any act was justifiable in the name of science. And yet, some of the things done right her in our own nation were reminiscent of the research being conducted under the direction of the notorious Dr. Mengele.Reading certain parts of this book, I found myself holding my breath in horror at some of the ideas conjured by medical practioners in the name of “research.” Of course, we know.* Anyone who is even moderately informed on this nation's medical history knows about the Tuskegee trials, MK Ultra, flu and hepatitis research on the disabled and incarcerated, radiation exposure experiments on hospital patients, and cancer, cancer, cancer. The poor, disabled and people of color in this country, the “land of the free,” have been subjected to so many cancer experiments, it defies belief. Many of these trials, including some devised of Henrietta's cells, have involved injecting cancer, non-consensually, into human subjects. So while it is true that there can be utterly no doubt that our lives, and the lives of much of the world, are better, because of the knowledge made possible by parts of Henrietta Lacks's body, still acknowledgment of this reality comes at the cost of knowing that procedures were performed on her without her knowledge or understanding, and without her consent, with impunity; these actions were made even easier because she was poor, black and female, and this is to say nothing of the numerous and unethical violations of her (and her children's) privacy. It's an old story. It's a story that her biographer, Rebecca Skloot, handles with grace and compassion. Henrietta is not some medical spectacle, she was a real woman. If she has been deified by her friends and family since her death, it is maybe the homage that she deserves, not for her cells, but for her vibrance, kindness, and the tragedy of a mother who died much too young. There are a great many scientific and historical facts presented in this book, facts that I couldn't possibly vet for veracity, but the science seems sound, if simplistic, and the history is presented in a conversational way, that is easy to read, and uninterrupted by footnotes and references. Family recollections are presented in storyteller fashion, which makes for easy and compelling reading. Fact-checking is made easy by a list of references, presented in chapter-by-chapter appendices. Rarely do I read something that makes me want to collar strangers in the street and tell them, “You MUST read this book,” but this is one of those times. Henrietta's story is bigger than medical research, and cures for polio, and the human genome, and Nuremberg. Henrietta's story is about basic human rights, and autonomy, and love. It's about knowledge and power, how it's human nature to find a way to justify even the worst things we can devise in the name of the greater good, and how we turn our science into a god. This story is bigger than Rebecca Skloot's book. But I am grateful that she wrote it, and thankful to have read it. Would the story have changed had Henrietta been given the opportunity to give her informed consent? That's the thread of mystery which runs through the entire story, the answer to which we can never know. *documentation in this list is inconsistent, but most of these experiments can be independently verified."

85,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,4,"A lot to process with this book. This book's been out for a while, so I'm just going to put down a bunch of thoughts rattling around in my head, and probably leave it at that:-legacy left by slavery and how it affected Henrietta Lacks and the members of her family, and African Americans in general (where they lived, what kind of employment was available to them, the quality of education available to them, the history of abuse and violence, and the impact on their mental health, and the quality and availability of healthcare)-the assumptions and treatment by the medical establishment, at the time, of their patients and patients' rights-the lack of laws, or their lack of clarity, around a patient's consent, and the ownership of a patient's waste products from medical procedures. This was well illustrated in this book, from the 1950s to the time of the book's publication. -the quality of scientific education and knowledge in the general public. Unless people have some understanding of science, how are they to know what questions to ask of their doctors? The more affluent will generally fare better here, I suspect, what with their access to probably better trained teachers, and the ability to get higher education. And affluence and better outcomes would be partially dependent on where one started out in life.-thank goodness medical procedures improve over time, or are retired in favour of treatments that work!!-bioethics--thank goodness there is debate and evolution of ideas and laws. Though there are probably still lots of grey areas around research and commercializations -I was interested to find out more about the point raised about the DNA of the cell descendants of Henrietta's original cancerous cells.-I was sickened by the treatment, or perhaps I should say mystery around the treatment of Elsie, Henrietta's eldest daughter at the hospital for the insane. Or what doctors could call insane at the time.This was a painful read, but an important accounting of a part of US history, and more specifically, the legacy of slavery on a family, and the changing attitudes and practices in medicine and science."
86,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"I am not sure how is it in other countries but here in the Philippines, if you bring your car for repair in a service center and the serviceman says that he replaced a part, you how to do in you should find that replaced part inside your car. I think it is their proof that they actually replaced that part and also for you to decide how you want to dispose, resell, reuse or recycle it. Normally, this practice bothers me because I have a very small space for junks at home and I do not know what to do with a malfunctioning compressor, air vent, axle, mudguard, leaking pipes, tubes, coolant container, etc. What am I going to do with them? The only thing I know w.r.t. car is how to replace the battery or a flat tire. So, I always end up giving those away to the poor junk man so as to have something to load in his pushcart.It may not be the best analogy to introduce a very compelling book like this. However, the logic is the same. The organ, tissue, cells or fluids that you left in the hospital during your last hospitalization or check-up is totally different from the car spare parts. But both are left after you get what you want and you think they are of no use to you anymore. You gave the authorization for the part to be removed and replaced (if possible) and you deserve to have the replaced unit because legally, you are still the owner of the original or replaced part. However, just like me and the car junks, I would imagine that you don't want to bring home with you some test tubes filled with your excess coagulated blood, liquified Chlorox-smelling semen, miniscule torn ligaments or decayed tooth. What are you going to do with them? Henrietta Lacks, a poor black Tobacco farmer, died of cervical cancer in 1951. Without her knowledge, the doctors got her cancerous tissue and tried to use its cells in a cell culture. Surprise. Surprise. Henrietta's cells propagate like wild fire and they are still alive up to now. It was the first successful cell culture since in all the previous attempts, the cells only lived for few days before dying. The book explains that in Henrietta's chromosomes has enzyme called telomerase that continuously rebuils the telomere which is a string of DNA found at the end of each of Henrietta's chromosome. Skloot says in her introduction that there is more to this, as well as other issues, but apologizes for not excluding them in this book's scope. That's fine with me, because the scientific discussions in the book are just enough for me not to fall asleep and lose interest. We all took Biology in high school and the Cell and its parts, how they work, etc is always that's subject's first lesson so I think you can get by.So what if Henrietta's cells are still alive today? Medical discoveries still happen and we don't know or don't care to know their history. Well, those cells have been used to developed vaccines for polio, gene mapping, cloning, etc. So? Well, Henrietta's cancer cells were used without her or her families consent. Henrietta died 2 weeks after being diagnosed with cervical cancer and she was so poor she had to be buried in an unmarked grave. So? Well, Henrietta was black and the doctors were white. In the 50's, America was still not so open with mixing the two colors. The whites probably would not want to have anything in their body taken from a black person. So? This book tackles a number of controversial questions on medical ethics, racism and social discrimination. However, this is not a serious boring book. Skloot's storytelling does not leave any tinge of textbook formality and this can be read just like any A-grade medical crime bestseller that has some sprinklings of family drama (Henrietta's children have to be given away to relatives after her death), incest (10-y/o Rebecca, Henrietta's daughter, escapes a horny uncle showing his erect penis and she does not know the meaning of a rigid penis) and the struggles of a black family despite having a world-renowned mother whose cells, called the HeLa cells, make a unprecedented contribution to the medical field and in prolonging our life expectancy.So? Well, what if the same thing happens to you? What are the chances that your excess semen was not put in the wastebasket but stored in a sperm bank and given away to childless couples for in vitro fertilization of the wife's ovum? Then what if that child becomes the new Einstein? a new Picasso? a new Shakespeare? a new G.G.Marquez? I'm just saying...  "
87,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3893454-christina,4,"This was an interesting read. While I applaud Skloot's attempt to present a fair look at the history of the HeLa cell line used in research labs all over the world, the book is clearly skewed toward sympathy for the family. Not that they don't deserve sympathy, but really, the problems of the family is NOT the fault of anyone involved with the cell line. Don't get me wrong, Henrietta and her family have had a hard life, and they do deserve some sympathy. But not for this particular issue.The sad fact is that Henrietta died of an aggressive cancer, leaving her family to live their lives without her. That was not her fault or the fault of her family, but it was also not the fault of the hospital staff of Johns Hopkins. Yes, there was racial and socio-economic discrimination, but the fact remains that Henrietta was treated to best of the ability of the doctors at that time. Do we view the taking of cell samples from Henrietta without her permission as unethical today? Most people would say yes. But the law still remains unclear about that, and in 1954 that was most certainly not seen as unethical - it was common practice. So in the context of the time, the act was not unethical. As for monetary compensation, Johns Hopkins did not profit from the growth of HeLa cells; in fact, the scientist that first worked with HeLa cells GAVE the cells away to many many many other labs FOR FREE. Those labs shared with other labs, etc. Are there companies that profit from the cells now? Yes. But they got the cells the same way everyone else did back then - for free. The company then did their own research to find a way to mass produce, store and ship living cells. At the point the first company started mass producing and selling the cells the identity of the donor was long hidden, and the fact the cells were widespread at that time made them common property, so people in possession of the cells could do pretty much anything they wanted with them. And now for the part that is a little stickier - the family found out about Henrietta's cells, were (sort of) tricked into donating blood and cell samples and were kept in the dark about the cell line for decades. Was that right? NO, absolutely not. HOWEVER, I will point out that some of the subsequent anger, confusion and fear on the part of the family was due to their extreme lack of education rather than a malicious attempt to prey upon the Lacks family. The science presented in the book is simplified somewhat for the lay person, which is nice, as is the look at the advances in medicine and research that HeLa cells have brought to the world. As a scientist, however, I think that Skloot's explanations were a little fuzzy and did not really dispel most people's image of how science works in the real world. Perhaps a little more objectivity and less family bonding would have made this a better book.In conclusion: though Skloot claims she tries to give an unbiased view of the history of HeLa cells and the family from whence it came, I am concerned that lay people who read this will not understand some of the finer points and it will increase the already rampant fear of science that pervades American culture. The majority of Americans are woefully un-educated in the sciences, to the point that many people view it as no different than magic,but weirder and scarier. "
88,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1431828-nnedi,5,"What a wonderfully told story. Rebecca Skloot really came through on the research. She dug it alllllll up. And the way she told Henrietta's story was beautiful and almost reflective of Henrietta's life. The story started at a point and then spread out to become a story that enveloped all of humanity. I read this as more research on Henrietta for my forthcoming novel THE BOOK OF PHOENIX and it was exactly what I needed and wanted. I wanted the science but I also wanted the close personal narrative of this woman and the people in her life; I wanted the good, the bad and the ugly. This book was all of that. Some of it is lovely, some was disturbing, plenty of it as shocking, and lots of it was heart-breaking. Her story is so deeplyAmerican. Also, it was really cool how close the writer got to the narrative. and eventually became a part of it. I love that. Oh and there's a touch of African magic in the story, which didn't surprise me at ALL, considering what this book was about. <3'd this book!"
89,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer,4,"You know all those forms you have to fill out while waiting at the doctor and dentist office? The tedious, repetitious ones that you could have sworn you already completed at least a thousand times? Next time you sigh loudly or roll your eyes at the prospect of this task, think about the people who came before us who were never offered the luxury of informed consent, confidentiality, and protection from discrimination. Horrendous injustices prompted these forms into action so that history does not repeat itself. It's a sad thought.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks offers historical insight into human rights issues within the medical field. Primarily though, it focuses on the woman behind the most famous and widely researched human cells in the world: Henrietta Lacks. Her name has only recently become known to the world which is quite sad, but thanks to her family's perseverance and Rebecca Skloot's heavy research and publication, the world now knows who to credit with most medical advances to date. It has been reported that Ms. Lacks had no knowledge of her contribution, as she was unaware that tissues were saved after multiple cancer biopsies/treatments, and therefore, she gave no permission for her cells to be used in any way, shape, or form, but Ms. Skloot reminds us that even today, none of us have any say over what is done with our cells and tissues once removed from our bodies. I appreciated Ms. Skloot's attention to Ms. Lacks' remaining family members and their immense struggles in spite of all the progress (and profits) made in the medical field. In my opinion though, she was a bit too forthcoming in regards to the family. Factors related to race, poverty, education, medical issues, disabilities, and access to healthcare are definitely warranted in a book like this to show the overall contrast between those benefiting from Ms. Lacks' contribution and the family that was left behind, along with the insensitivity and injustice of it all. However, criminal histories, superstitions, and mental illness had no place in this book in my opinion. I believe this was potentially harmful to the family's character, and some portions of the book painted the family in a money-hungry and incompetent light which was unnecessary even if that may have been Ms. Skloot's perception or experience. Regardless, the family's inclusion in this book did make all the difference and I thoroughly enjoyed my reading experience.

He started shaking my hand and wormed his way into the house.“Mr. Kemper, I’m John Doe with Dee-Bag Industries Incorporated. I need you to sign some paperwork and take a ride with me. Don’t worry, I’ll have you home in a day or two,” he said. Then he pulled a document out of his briefcase, set it on the coffee table and pushed a pen in my hand. “Wait a second. What the hell is this all about?” I said as I tried to pick up the paper to read it, but Doe kept trying to force my hand with the pen down on it so I couldn‘t see what it said.“Oh, that’s just legal mumbo-jumbo. You’d rather try and read your mortgage agreement than this old thing. Just put your name down and let’s be on our way, shall we?” he said.There was a brief scuffle, but I managed to distract him by messing up his carefully gelled hair. As he shrieked and ran around looking for a mirror, I finally got to read the document.“This is a medical consent form. What’s going on?” I demanded as I shook the paper at him. Once he had combed and smoothed his hair back into perfection, Doe sighed.“Very well, Mr. Kemper. I guess I’ll have to come clean. Do you remember when you had your appendix out when you were in grade school?”“Sure. That gave me one of my better scars, but that was like 30 years ago. Why are you here now?” I asked.“You’re probably not aware of this, but your appendix was used in a research project by DBII,” Doe said.“Really? I assumed it just got incinerated or used in the hospital cafeteria’s meatloaf special. Why would anyone want to study my rotten appendix?”“Oh, all kinds of research is done on tissue gathered during medical procedures. Most people don’t know that, but it’s very common,” Doe said.“OK, but why are you here now?”“Well, your appendix turned out to be very special. It was secreting some kind of pus that no one had seen before. After many tests, it turned out to be a new chemical compound with commercial applications. So a patent was filed based on that compound and turned into a consumer product,” Doe admitted.“That sounds disgusting. What was it used in? Because I want to make sure to never buy it,” I said.“It’s the basis for the adhesive on Post-It Notes,” Doe said.“Are you freaking kidding me? Post-It Notes are based on my old appendix?”“I’m absolutely serious, Mr. Kemper. Now we at DBII need your help. Unfortunately for us, you haven’t had anything removed lately. So I have to get your consent if we’re going to do further studies,” Doe said.“But you already got my goo-seeping appendix. I don’t have another one,” I said. “True, but sales have been down for Post-It Notes lately. So after the marketing and research boys talked it over for a while, they thought we should bring you in for a full body scan. Maybe you’ve got a spleen giving out or something else that we could pull out and see if we could use it,” Doe said.“This is pretty damn disturbing,” I said.“Why? You’re an organ donor, right? Same thing,” Doe said.“I don’t consider someone lucking into an organ if the Chiefs win a play-off game and I have a goddamn heart attack the same thing as companies making money off tissue I had removed decades ago and didn’t know anything about,” I said.“Fortunately, the American government and legal system disagree. So how about it, Mr. Kemper? Will you come with me?” Doe asked.“I dunno. What’s my end of this? You already owe me a fat check for the Post-Its.”“Oh, no. You won’t get any money from the Post-Its, or if any future discoveries from your tissues lead to more gains.” Doe said.“That’s complete bullshit!”“Again, the legal system disagrees with you. But this is for science, Mr. Kemper. You don’t want to hold up medical scientific research that could save lives, do you?”“It’s for Post-It Notes!”“Maybe, but who is to say that the cure for some terrible disease isn't lurking somewhere in your genes? Could you live with yourself if you prevented crucial medical research just because you were ticked off that you didn’t get any money for your appendix? Remember that it’s not like you could have NOT had your appendix removed. At least, not if you wanted to keep living. And I highly doubt that you would have had the resources to have it studied and discovered the adhesive for yourself even if you would have taken it home with you in a jar after it was removed. We’re the ones who spent all that money to get some good out of a piece of disgusting gunk that tried to kill you. So shouldn’t we be compensated? What are you? Some kind of damn dirty hippie liberal socialist?” Doe said in disgust“You’re a hell of a corporate lackey, Doe,” I said.“Thank you.”“Fine. I’ll do it,” I said as I signed the form. “But I want some free Post-It Notes.”“No deal. Steal them from work like everyone else,” Doe said.******Obviously, I‘m a big fat liar and none of this happened, but I really did have my appendix out as a kid. Plus, my tonsils got yanked and I’ve had my fair share of blood taken over the years. What this book taught me is that it’s highly likely that some of my scraps are sitting in frozen jars in labs somewhere. Yours, too. If any of us have anything unique in our tissues that may be valuable for medical research, it’s possible that they’d be worth a fortune, but we’d never see a dime of it.Henrietta Lacks couldn’t be considered lucky by any stretch of the imagination. A black woman who grew up poor on a tobacco farm, she married her cousin and moved to the Baltimore area. Her husband apparently liked to step out on her and Henrietta ended up with STDs, and one of her children was born mentally handicapped and had to be institutionalized. In 1951, Henrietta was diagnosed with cervical cancer by doctors at Johns Hopkins. During her biopsy, cell samples were taken and given to a researcher who had been working on the problem of trying to grow human cells. Henrietta’s cancer spread wildly, and she was dead within a year. But her cells turned out to be an incredible discovery because they continued growing at a very fast rate. The doctor at Johns Hopkins started sharing his find for no compensation, and this coincided with a large need for cell samples due to testing of the polio vaccine. The HeLa cells would be crucial for confirming that the vaccine worked and soon companies were created to grow and ship them to researchers around the world. Since then, Henrietta’s cells have been sent into outer space and subjected to nuclear tests and cited in over 60,000 medical research papersUnfortunately, no one ever asked Henrietta’s permission and her family knew nothing about the important role her cells played in medicine for decades. Poor and with little formal education, Henrietta’s children were confused by what was actually done to their mother and upset when they learned that her tissue was part of a multi-million dollar industry that they‘ve received no compensation from..Rebecca Skloot has written a fascinating book that clearly outlines why Henrietta’s cells were so important, why she went unrecognized for decades, the pain it’s caused her family, and the way that new medical discoveries over the last sixty years have opened a potential Pandora’s Box of legal and ethical issues regarding tissue collection, research, patents and money. This book brings up a lot of issues that we’re probably all going to be dealing with in the future. Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog."
91,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"This is an all-gold five star read.It's actually two stories, the story of the HeLa cells and the story of the Lacks family told by a journalist who writes the first story objectively and the second, in which she is involved, subjectively. The contrast between the poor Lacks family who cannot afford their medical bills and the research establishment who have made millions, maybe billions from these cells is ironic and tragic. It has been established by other law cases that if the family had gone for restitution they would not have got it, but that's a moot point as they couldn't afford a lawyer in any case. I have seen some bad reviews about this book. People who think that the story of the Lacks - poor rural African-Americans who never made it 'up' from slavery and whose lifestyle of decent working class folk that also involves incest, adultery, disease and crime, they just dismiss with 'heard it all before' and 'my family despite all obstacles succeeded so what is wrong with the Lacks?' I wonder if these people who not only totally can't see the wonderful writing that brings these people to life and who so lack in compassion themselves are the sort of people who oppose health care for the masses? As an extremely wealthy American tourist once put it to me, he had earned good health care by his hard work and success in life, it was one of the perks, why waste good money on, say, a a triple-bypass on someone who hasn't even succeeded enough to afford health insurance? That they were a drain on society, non-contributors and not the way America needed to go to move forward.I don't think you can rate people by what they have achieved materially. Success depends a great deal on opportunity and many don't have that. Henrietta Lacks didn't have it and her children didn't have it, not even her grandchildren made much of a way for themselves, but the next generation, the great grandchildren - ah now they are going in for Masters degrees and maybe their children will be major contributors. The author intends to recompense the family by setting up a scholarship for at least one of them. All of us came originally from poverty and to put down those that are still mired in the quicksand of never having enough spare cash to finance an education is cruel, uncompassionate and hardly looking to the future.HeLa cells have given us our future. They are the most researched and tested human cells in existence. All of us have benefited from the medical advances made using them and the book is recognition of what a great contribution Henrietta Lacks and her family with all their donations of tissue and blood, mostly stolen from them under false pretences, have made. Indeed one of the researchers who looks like having told a lot of lies (and then lied about that) in order to get the family to donate blood to further her research is still trying to get them to donate more. She's a hard-nosed scientist, with an excellent job and income and to her the Lacks are no more than providers of raw material. Sometimes you can't make hard and fast rulings. No I don't think we should have to give informed consent for experiments to be done on tissue or blood donated during a procedure or childbirth - that would slow medical research unbearably. I don't think cells should be identifiable with the donor either, it should be quite anonymous (as it now is). However, there is only ever one 'first' in any sphere and that one does deserve recognition and now with the book, some 50 years after her life ended, Henrietta Lacks has it. Good on yer, Rebecca Skloot, you've done a good thing here."

“She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?”
I've moved this book on and off my TBR for years. The truth is that, with few exceptions, I'm generally turned off by the thought of non-fiction. I'm a fan of fictional stories, and I think I've always felt that non-fiction will be dry, boring and difficult to get through. Especially a book about science, cells and medicine when I'm more of a humanities/social sciences kinda girl.But this book... it's just so interesting. It's written in a very easy, journalistic style and places the author into the story (some people didn't like this, but I thought it felt like you were going along for the journey). It's all the interesting bits of science, full of eye-opening and shocking discoveries, but it's also about history, sociology and race.I started reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks while sat next to my boyfriend. Every so often I would unknowingly gasp or mutter ""oh my god"" and he was like ""what? what?"" and I hadn't even realized I'd done it out loud. It's just full of surprises - and every one is true! It uncovers things you almost certainly didn't know about. And it just shows that sometimes real life can be nastier, more shocking, and more wondrous than anything you could imagine.Maybe you've heard of HeLa in passing, maybe you don't know anything about these cells that helped in cancer research, in finding a polio vaccine, in cloning, in gene mapping and discovering the effects of an atom bomb; either way, this tells an incredible and awful story of a poor, black woman in the American South who was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She is given back her humanity, becoming more than a cluster of cells and being shown for the tough, spirited woman she was. From her own family life to the frankly nauseating treatment of black patients in the 1950s, her story emerges.Not only that, but this book is about the injustices committed by the pharmaceutical industry - both in this individual case (how is it that Henrietta's family are dirt poor when she has revolutionized medicine?) and on a larger scale (during the 1950s, many prisoners were injected with cancer as part of medical experiments!). It's hard to believe what so-called ""professionals"" have gotten away with throughout history - things that we generally associate with Nazi death camps.I honestly could not put it down. Maybe because it's not just about science and cells, but is mainly about all of the humanity and social history behind scientific discoveries. Maybe because Skloot is so damn passionate about her subject and that passion is transferred to the reader. Whatever the reason, I highly recommend it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"
93,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"This was a really good book that leaves one with more questions than it answers, especially at this moment with the explosion in investment and growth in health/biotech. A lot of those questions are ones I wouldn't know how to answer myself either. I think it's really important though that we all start grappling with and instituting better processes around things like informed consent. Also really horrible to think about this in larger societal terms, in the context of institutional racism, and the ways in which the Lacks family still is so socioeconomically disadvantaged while private biotechnology companies sell their mother's cells for so much money. I just feel so extremely uncomfortable with that. I think I wouldn't care so much if the cells were just part of the commons, available for free, or extremely cheaply, but to know people are profiting off of it, it really is quite disgusting. I try not to bring my politics to bear here quite too often but this really really makes me feel strongly that commercialization of things in biological research, especially people's biological matter and tissue shouldn't be happening. This whole situation just feels quite perverse honestly and the book left me feeling disheartened. The dual dehumanization of the Lacks family through science and commercialization is horrifying. And I think if we wants things to be better moving forward both need to be addressed, not just one."
94,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"On October 4, 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a thirty-one-year old black woman, died after a gruesome battle with a rapidly metastasizing cancer. During her treatment, the doctors at Johns Hopkins took some cells from her failing body and used them for research. This was not an unusual thing to have done in 1951. But the cells that came from Ms. Lacks’ body were unusual. They had qualities that made them uniquely valuable as research tools. Labeled “HeLa”, Henrietta’s cells were reproduced by the billions over the following sixty years and have been instrumental in experiments across a wide range of biological science. Today, HeLa cells are sold by the vial at impressive prices. Yet, Ms. Lacks’ family has seen not a penny of compensation from the work that has been made possible by their relative’s unique cells. Rebecca Skloot - from Powell'sRebecca Skloot, a science writer with articles published in many major outlets, spent years looking into the genesis of these cells. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells four stories. First is the tale of HeLa cells, and the value they have been to science; second is the life of, arguably, the most important cell “donor” in history, and of her family; third is a look at the ethics of cell “donation” and the commercial and legal significance of rights involved; and fourth is the Visible Woman look at Skloot’s pursuit of the tales. Each story is significant. The contribution of HeLa cells has been huge and it is important to know how these cells came to be so widely used, and what are the characteristics that make them so valuable. Skloot goes into a reasonable level of detail for those of us who do not make our living in a lab coat. She adds information on how cell cultures can become contaminated, and how that impacts completed research. She also offers a description of telomeres, strings of DNA at the end of chromosomes critical to longevity, and key to the immortality of HeLa cells. Fascinating stuff. Henrietta Lacks - From Science And FilmSkloot constructs a biography of Henrietta, and patches together a portrait of the life of her family, from her ancestors to her children, siblings and other relations. It is with a source of pride, among other emotions, that her family regards Henrietta’s impact on the world. Skloot delves into these feelings, and the experiences the Lacks family members have had over the decades with people trying to write about Henrietta, and people trying to exploit their interest in Henrietta for dark purposes.The author had to overcome considerable family resistance before she was able to get them to meet with and ultimately open up to her. She takes us through her process, showing who she talked with, when, and the result of those conversations, what institutions she contacted re locating and gaining access to information about Henrietta and some other family members. Most interesting, and at times frustrating, is her story of how she gained the trust of some, if not all, of the Lacks family. This is like presenting a how-to of her research process, a blow-by-blow description of the way research is done in the real world, and it is very enlightening.The Immortal Tale of Henrietta Lacks has received considerable acclaim. It is all well-deserved. The book is an eye-opening window into a piece of our history that is mostly unknown. It presents science in a very manageable way and gives us plenty to think about the next time we have a blood test or any other medical procedure. This book may not be as immortal as Henrietta’s cells, but it will stay with you for a very long time.The HBO Film airs on April 22, 2017==============================EXTRA STUFF8/8/13 - NY Times article - A Family Consents to a Medical Gift, 62 Years Later3/29/17 - Washington Post - On the eve of an Oprah movie about Henrietta Lacks, an ugly feud consumes the family - by Steve Hendrix"

Strengths:
*Fantastically interesting subject!One woman's cancerous cells are multiplied and distributed around the globe enabling a new era of cellular research and fueling incredible advances in scientific methodology, technology, and medical treatments. This strain of cells, named HeLa (after Henrietta Lacks their originator), has been amazingly prolific and has become integrated into advancements of science around the world (space travel, genome research, pharmaceutical treatments, polio vaccination, etc). *Thought-Provoking Ethical Questions This book makes you ponder ethical questions historically raised by the unfolding sequence of events and still rippling currently. Ex. 1) Informed consent: Henrietta did not provide informed consent (not required in those days). Ex. 2) Genetic rights/non-rights: her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later. Ex. 3) Patents and profits for biologic material: zero profits realized by Henrietta or her descendants; multiple-millions in profits have been realized by individuals and corporations utilizing her genetic material.*Biographical description of Henrietta and interviews with her family.  The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications. We're reading about actual, valuable people and historic events.
Weaknesses:
*Framework: the book is framed around the author's journey of writing the story and her interactions with Henrietta's family. I thought the author got in the way and would have preferred to have to read less of her journey and more coverage of the science involved and its ethical implications. I found myself distinctly not caring how many times the author circled the block or how many trips she made to Henrietta's birthplace.*Lack of Clarity: By mid-point through the book, I was wishing the biographical approach was more refined and focused. The narrative swerved through the author's interest in various people as she encountered them along the way: Henrietta, Henrietta's immediate family, scientists, Henrietta's extended family, a neighborhood grocery store owner, a con artist, Henrietta's youngest daughter, Henrietta's oldest daughter, etc. Everything was a side dish; no particular biography satisfied as a main course.
Bottom Line:
This book won't join my 'to re-read' shelf...but has whetted my appetite for further exploration of this important woman, fascinating topic and intriguing ethical questions.I was left wanting more:-more detail surrounding the science involved, -more coverage of past and present ethical implications-a more refined biography of Henrietta, and -a more focused look at the impact and implications of the HeLa cell strain line on Henrietta's descendants."

A young black mother dies of cervical cancer in 1950 and unbeknownst to her becomes the impetus for many medical advances through the decades that follow because of the cancer cells that were taken without her permission. This book evokes so many thoughts and feelings, sometimes at odds with one another. It is thought provoking and informative in the details and heartbreaking in the rendering of the personal story of Henrietta Lacks. I was madder than hell that people/companies made loads of money on the Hela cell line while some members of the Lacks family didn’t have health insurance . Yet, I am grateful for the research advances that made a polio vaccine possible, advanced cancer research and genetics, and so much more.Rebecca Skloot does a wonderful job of presenting the moral and legal questions of medical research without consent meshing this with the the human side giving a picture of the woman whose cells saved so many lives. We get to know her family, especially her daughter Deborah who worked tirelessly with the author to discover what happened to her mother. This made it all so real - not just a recitation of the facts. The scientific aspects are very detailed but understandable. It was the sections on Henrietta and her family that I wanted to read the most.In 1950 there was “no formal research oversight in the United States.” Years later there are laws on “informed consent “ and how medical research is conducted, and protection of privacy for medical records. Yet even today, there are controversies over the ownership of human tissue. The in depth research over years in writing this book is evident and I believe a heartfelt effort to recognize Henrietta Lacks for her unwitting contribution to medical research."
98,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114573-chelsea,3,"This could have been an incredible book. Henrietta Lacks' story is finally told--and Skloot makes very clear how important Lacks' cells have been to the last 60 years of science and, paradoxically, how much Henrietta and her family suffered because those cells were taken from Henrietta without her consent. But in her effort to contrast the importance and profitability of Henrietta's cells with the marginalization and impoverishment of Henrietta's family, Skloot makes three really big mistakes. First, she's not transparent about her own journalistic ethics, which is troubling in a book about ethics. Did the Lacks family end up benefiting from her book financially? Did all Lacks give permission for their depictions in the book? We never know. Second, Skloot's narration when describing the Lacks family suffering--sexual abuse, addiction, disability, mental illness--lacks sensitivity; it often feels clinical and sometimes even voyeuristic. Again, this is disturbing in a book that concerns the importance of dignity, consent, etc.Finally, Skloot inserts herself into the story over and over, not so subtly suggesting that she is a hero for telling Henrietta's story. Sometimes, it appears that she is making the very offensive suggestion that she, a highly educated unreligious white woman, has healed the Lacks family by showing them science and history."
99,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731872-kathleen,3,"My thoughts on this book are kind of all over the place. I feel for the Lacks family, I really do. It's hard to read about the poverty and lack of education and the cavalier approach towards informed consent in the early days of Johns Hopkins Research Hospital. The fact that the HeLa cell line is the foundation of so much valuable research is rightfully a source of pride for the family of Henrietta Lacks. I don't think they will ever see monetary compensation for their mother's cancer cell line, however. That horse left the barn a long, long time ago.Furthermore, I don't feel the admiration for the author of this book like I think many others do. She wanted to make herself out to be different than all the rest of the people who wrote about the woman behind the HeLa cell line but I only saw the similarities. Yes, she has established a scholarship fund for the descendants of Henrietta Lacks but I got tired of hearing again and again how she financed her research herself. I think the exploitation is there, just prettied up a bit with a lot of self-congratulatory descriptions of how HARD she had to try to talk to the family and how MANY times she called asking for interviews. At times I felt like she badgered them worse than the unethical people who had come before.The sadness of this story is really about the devastation of a family when its unifying force, a strong mother, is removed. Piled on with more sadness about the appalling institutional conditions for mentally handicapped patients (talking about Henrietta Lacks' oldest daughter) back in the 50's and you have tragedy on top of more tragedy."
100,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,4,"This is a very powerful and informative story. Also, with the history of personal freedoms, civil rights, and right to privacy/requiring consent, this is a very important books. I am not sure the details about the science involved in the story will appeal to all. Just the same as how those who are here for the science may be disinterested in the background stories of the people involved. But, if you think you will like one of the other, I don’t think the one you don’t care for will be distracting.With that in mind, I will continue with the statement that it really is two books: the science and the people. First, the background of cell and tissue research in the last 100 years is intriguing and to hear about all of the advances and why Henretta Lacks was key to them is fascinating. Second, the background of not only the Lacks family, but also others who have had their tissues/cells used for research without permission, gives a lot of food for thought. Almost every medical advancement, and many scientific advancements, in the past 60 years are because of Henrietta Lacks. But, questions about the consent she gave, what she understood about her cells being used, and how much the family has benefited are all questioned and discussed. It really hits hard to think that you may have no control over parts of you once they are no longer part of your body. Also, the fiscal and research ramifications of giving people more rights over their body tissue/cells really creates a huge Catch-22. As I had surgery earlier this year that involved some tissue being removed for analysis, it started to make me wonder what I signed on all those forms and if my cells might still be out there being used for research.The only part of the book that kind of dragged for me was the time that the author spent with the family late in the book. After listening to an interview with the author it was surprising to hear that this part of the book may have been her original focus (how the family has dealt with the revelations surrounding the use of their mother’s cells), but to me it kind of dragged and got repetitive. I don’t think it is bad and others may find it interesting, it just was what brought down my interest in the story a little bit.If you like science-based stories, medical-based stories, civil/personal rights history, and/or just love a decent non-fiction, I think this book is very worth checking out."
101,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1992225-liz-nutting,5,"When I was a graduate student in the field of Ethics, one of my favorite pedagogical strategies, as both a teacher and a student, was the case study. A good case study can make an abstract ethical issue more concrete. A really good case study can turn a deeply contentious issue into an opportunity for thoughtfulness and compassion; right and wrong (to the extent that those concepts even belong in the study of ethics) are nuanced by descriptions of circumstances or values or human need that can make it easier to see and hear and believe the ones on the other side(s) of an issue. Often the case studies are hypothetical, or descriptions of actual cases pared to ""just the facts, ma'am,"" without all the possible extenuating circumstances that can shape difficult decisions. For some students, this causes great angst. How could they be asked to make a judgment, especially one that might involve life or death, without knowing all the details? And of course, at the end of the lesson, everyone wants to know what really happened, how things turned out ""in real life."" On those rare occasions when we actually do know something of the outcome, it is clear that knowing what ""really"" happened almost never makes the decision easier, clearer, or less agonizing. And that is what makes The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks so deeply compelling and challenging. It is the rare story of the outcome of a seemingly inconsequential decision by a doctor and a researcher in 1951, one that few at that time would have ever seen as an ethical decision, let alone an unethical one. A researcher studying cell cultures needs samples; a doctor treating a woman with aggressive cervical cancer scrapes a few extra cells of that cancer into a Petri dish for the researcher. The missing cells had no bearing whatsoever on the outcome of the woman's disease, so no harm done. A few weeks later the woman is dead, but her cancer cells are living in the lab. The bare bones ethical issue at stake--whether it is ethically warranted to take a patient's tissues without consent and subsequently use them for scientific and medical research--is even now not a particularly contentious one...yet. Legally, the case law is settled: tissue removed in the course of medical treatment or testing no longer belongs to the patient. It is, in essence, refuse, and one woman's trash is another man's treasure. Ethically, almost all the professional guidelines encourage researchers to obtain consent, but they have no teeth (and most were non-existent in 1951 anyway). In reality, the vast majority of the tissue taken from patients is of limited use. But there are those rare times when a single person's cells have the potential to break open the worlds of science and medicine, to the benefit of millions--and the enrichment of a very few. Such was the case with the cells of cervical cancer taken from Henrietta Lacks at Johns Hopkins University hospital. HeLa cells grew in the lab of George Gey. And grew. And grew, unlike any cell before it. Next, they were carried to a different laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, where Jonas Salk used them to successfully test his polio vaccine, and thus the cancer that had killed Henrietta Lacks directly led to the healing of millions worldwide. Soon HeLa cells would be in almost every major research laboratory in the world. They traveled to Asia to help find a cure for hemorrhagic fever and into space to study the effects of zero gravity on human cells. Even today, almost 60 years after Henrietta's death, HeLa cells are some of the most widely used by the scientific community. With such immeasurable benefits as these, who could possibly doubt the wisdom of Henrietta's doctor to take a tiny bit of tissue? But the ""real"" story is much more complicated. Henrietta Lacks was uneducated, poor and black. Her cancer was treated in the ""colored"" ward of Johns Hopkins. Her death left five children without their mother, to be raised by an abusive cousin. Should any of that matter in weighing the morality of taking tissue from a patient without her consent, especially in light of the benefits? God knows our country's history of medical experimentation on the poor and minority populations is not pretty. Ironically, one of the laboratories researching with HeLa cells in the 1950s was the one at the Tuskegee Institute--at the very same time that the infamous syphilis studies were taking place. In light of that history, Henrietta's race and socioeconomic status can't help but be relevant factors in her particular case. But her children's status? What bearing does that have? According to author Rebecca Skloot, in ethical discussions of the use of human tissue, ""[t]here are, essentially, two issues to deal with: consent and money."" Both become issues for Henrietta's children. The family didn't learn until 1973 that their mother's cells had been taken, or that they'd played such a vital role in the development of scientific knowledge. They spent the next 30 years trying to learn more about their mother's cells. As they learned of the money made by the pharmaceutical companies and other companies as a direct result of HeLa cells, they inevitably asked questions about what share, if any, they were entitled to. As Henrietta's eldest son put it, ""If our mother so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?"" But even more than financial compensation, the family wants recognition--and respect--for their mother. They want the woman behind her contributions acknowledged for who she is--a black woman, a mother, a person with name longer than four letters. And they want to know the mother they never knew, to find out the facts of her death. In the lab at Johns Hopkins, looking through a microscope at her mother's cells for the first time, daughter Deborah sums it up: ""John Hopkin [sic] is a school for learning, and that's important. But this is my mother. Nobody seem to get that."" Would a fully informed Henrietta Lacks have made the decision to give her tissue to George Gey if asked? Would her decision either way have had any affect whatsoever on her children's future lives? We'll never know, of course. But reading the story behind the case study makes these questions far more potent than any ethics textbook can. And as science now unravels the strains of our DNA--thanks in no small part to HeLa--these are no longer inconsequential questions for any of us. Perhaps we, too, like the doctors and scientists who have long studied HeLa, can learn from the case study of Henrietta Lacks. "
102,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-bionic-jean,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is is an extraordinary book. By turns it is shocking, informative and tragic. There is brilliance - but also deep injustice. It is in part an account of the development of genetics, part social commentary, and partly the story of one woman, Henrietta Lacks. She was an African-American woman descended from slaves and one white slave-owner (Lacks), and she lived as many hundreds of black people still did even as late as the 1950's, in poverty in an old slave-cabin - the ""home-house"" - in East Baltimore. And although the events do not always make for easy reading, the author assures us that it is completely non-fiction. Nothing has been invented, nothing exaggerated. The author has done her level best to tell things as they were. Although the name ""Henrietta Lacks"" is comparatively unknown, ""HeLa"" cells are routinely used in scientific experiments worldwide today, and have been for decades. They are the only human cells thought to be scientifically ""immortal"" ie if they are provided with the correct culture and environment they do not die. They were cut from a tumour in the cervix of Henrietta Lacks a few months before she died in 1951; extracted because she had a particular virulent form of cancer. Despite extreme measures taken in the laboratories to protect the cells, human cells had always inevitably died after a few days. HeLa cells though, stayed alive in the petri dish, and proved to be virtually unstoppable, growing faster and stronger than any other cells known.These HeLa cells were used to develop the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilisation and a host of other medical treatments. They were sent on the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity. It is fair to say that they have helped with some of the most important advances in medicine. But there is a terrible irony and injustice in this. The people to benefit from this were largely white people. Henrietta Lacks's family and descendants suffered appalling poverty. Working from dawn to dusk in poisonous tobacco fields was the norm as soon as the children were able to stand. Moving from Virginia's tobacco production to Bethlehem Steel, a boiler manufacturer in South Boston, was little better, as they were then exposed to asbestos and coal. The families had intermingled for generations. Henrietta and Day, her husband, were first cousins, and this was by no means unusual. So the predisposition to illness was both hereditary and environmental. But access to medical help was virtually nil. Most hospitals accepted only whites, or grudgingly admitted so-called ""colored"" people to a separate area, which was far less well funded and staffed. The Lacks family had to travel a long way in order to be treated, and then were not allowed the privilege of proper explanations as to the treatment given - or the tissue samples extracted.At this time unusual cells were taken routinely by doctors wanting to make their own investigations into cancer (which at that time was thought to be a virus) and many other conditions. No permission was sought; none was needed. The Hippocratic oath doctors set such store by dates from the 4th Century BC, and makes no mention of it; neither did the law of the time require it. It was not until 1947, that the subject was raised. Nazi doctors had performed many ethically unsound operations and experiments on live Jews, and during the trials after the war the Nuremberg Code - a 10 point code of ethics - was set up. This states that, ""The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential."" Even then it was advice, not law. Rebecca Skloot says that Howard Jones, the doctor who had originally diagnosed Henrietta Lacks' cancer, said, ""Hopkins, with its large indigent black population, had no dearth of clinical material."" It was clearly a racial norm of the time. In fact to be fair, the white doctors had no real conception that what they were doing had an ethical side. George Gey and his assistants were responsible for isolating the genetic material in Henrietta's cells - an astonishing feat. Gey happily shared the cells with any scientists who asked. The issue of payment was never raised, but the HeLa cells fast became a commodity, and the Lacks's family, who were never consulted about anything, mistakenly assumed until very recently that Gey must have made a fortune out of them. As Henrietta's daughter Deborah said, ""Them white folks getting rich of our mother while we got nothin."" Skloot carefully chronicles some of the most shocking medical stories from these times. The reader infers from her examples that testing on the impoverished and disadvantaged was almost routine. One notorious study was into syphilis and apparently went on for 40 years. It was called the ""Tuskegee study"", and involved thousands of males at varying stages of the disease. At the time it was known that they could be cured by penicillin, but they were not given this treatment, in order that doctors could study the progress of the disease. In this case they were volunteers, but were encouraged by the offer of free travel to the hospital, a free meal when they got there, and the promise of $50 for their families after they died, for funeral expenses. There are many such poignant examples. The author also says that in 1954 thousands of chronically ill elderly people, convicts and even some children, were injected by a Dr. Chester Southam with HeLa cells, basically just to see what would happen. Of course many of them went on to develop cancer. One man who had Hela cells injected in his arm produced small tumours there within days. But the patients were never informed of this, and if they did happen to ask were told they were being ""tested for immunity"". (We are told that Southam was prosecuted for this much later in 1966.) It was not until 1957 that there was any mention in law of ""informed consent."" Confidentially and privacy violation issues came far later.After her death, four of Henrietta Lacks's children, Lawrence, Deborah, Sonny and Joe, were put in the charge of Ethel, a friend of the family who had been very envious of Henrietta. It appears that she was incredibly cruel to the children, hardly ever feeding them until late, after a day's work, when they would be given a meagre crust. She would also drag the youngest one, Joe, out of bed at will, and beat him unmercifully. Joe was only 4 months old when his mother died and grew up to have severe behavioural problems. In fact later on on life, all these children grew to have not only health problems (including all being almost deaf) but a myriad of social problems too - being involved in burglary, assault and drugs - and spent a lot of their lives in prison.One of Henrietta's five children had been put in ""Crownsville Hospital for the Negro Insane"" when she was still tiny, because Henrietta was too ill to care for her any more. The story of this child, which is gradually told through Skloot's text as more of it is revealed, is heart-breaking. It is not clear why Elsie was so slow, but her mental retardation is now thought to be partly due to syphilis, and partly due to being born on the home-house stone floor - which was routine for such families at the time - and banging her head during birth. It was not known what had subsequently happened to Elsie until Skloot's research, but then some records were discovered. A photograph of Elsie shows a miserable child apparently in pain in a distorted position. Apparently brain scans then necessitated draining the surrounding brain fluid. Never mind that the patient might then suffer violent headaches, fits and vomiting for 2-3 months until the fluid reformed; it gave a better picture. Many people had been sent to this institution because of ""idiocy"" or epilepsy; the assumption now is that that they were incarcerated to get them out of the way, and that tests like this, often for research, were routine. Figures from 1955, when Elsie died, showed that at that time the hospital had 2700 patients, which was 800 over the maximum capacity. The ratio of doctors to patients was 1 doctor for 225 patients.Add into this the appalling inhumanity of history where white people used black people for their own ends, and the fears of Henrietta's family and community become inevitable. There had been stories for generations of white-coated doctors coming at dead of night and experimenting on black people. This became confused - or perhaps vindicated - by the Ku Klux Klan. Stories of voodoo, charismatic religious experiences, dire poverty, lack of basic education (one of Henrietta's brothers was more fortunate in that he had 4 years' schooling in total) untreated health problems and the prevailing 1950's attitudes of never questioning the doctor, all fed into the mix resulting in ignorance and occasional hysteria.Much of the first part of this book includes descriptions of scientific research and discoveries; both the theory and practise of how genes were isolated. Alternating with this is the background to the racial tensions, and the history of Henrietta Lacks' ancestry and family. Rebecca Skloot, a science writer, had been fascinated by the potential story since school days, when she first heard of HeLa cells, but nobody seemed to know anything about them. She started this book in her 20's, and spent a decade researching it, financed by credit cards and student loans. As a white woman she was treated with gross suspicion by all Henrietta Lacks's family. Eventually she formed a good relationship with Deborah, but it took a year before Deborah would even speak to her, and Deborah's brothers were very resistant. Several of them were pastors, as was James Pullam, her husband. They believed the Bible literally and had many fears about how Henrietta's cells were used. Deborah herself could not understand how they were immortal. Could her mother's cells feel pain when they were exploded, or infected? Would they develop into half-human half-chicken freaks when they were split and combined with chicken cells? Were there millions of clones all looking like her mother wandering around London? The media worldwide had played its part in adding to these fears, which had been spawned by a genuine ignorance.The interviews with Henrietta's family, and the progress and discoveries Skloot made accompanied by Deborah in the second part of the book, do make the reader uneasy. Indeed parts of these passages read like a trashy novel. Skloot says she wanted to report the conversation verbatim, so the vernacular is reported intact. Fair enough. But there is a lot of, ""Deborah shouted"" or, ""Lawrence yelled"". Of course they did! All of Henrietta's children had severe health problems, probably due to a variety of factors; their environment, upbringing and genetic inheritance. They were all very hard of hearing, so yes, they would shout when amongst themselves. Add to this Skloot's tendency to describe the attributes and appearance of a family member as ""beautiful hazel-nut brown skin"" or ""twinkling eyes"" and there is a whiff of condescension which does not sit well. Does it add anything to this account? Would a description of the author as having ""raven-black hair and full glossy lips"" help? Of course not. The author may feel she is being complimentary; she is not. She is being patronising. But it is difficult to know how else the total incomprehension and ignorance of how a largely white society operated could have been conveyed, other than by this verbatim reportage, even though at worst it comes across as extremely crass, and at best gently humorous.It would be convenient to imagine that these appalling cases were a thing of the past. But the book continues detailing injustices until the date of its publication in 2010. Henrietta's son, Sonny had a quintuple bypass in 2003. Skloot reports, ""The last thing he remembered before falling unconscious under the anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened in medicine."" So far, so good. There was recognition. But Skloot then delivers the final shot, ""Sonny woke up more than $125,500 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery."" As Lawrence (Henrietta's eldest son) says elsewhere, ""It's not fair! She's the most important person in the world and her family [are] living in poverty. If our mother [is] so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""Henrietta's original cancer had in fact been misdiagnosed. It was discovered years later that because she had syphilis, she had the genital warts HPV virus, which does actually invade the DNA. There is an intriguing section on this, as well as the ""HeLa bomb"", where one doctor painstakingly proved to the whole of the scientific community that a lot of their research had been flawed, as HeLa cells were contaminating many of the other cells they had been working with and drawing conclusions from. They were so virulent that they could travel on the smallest particle of dust in the atmosphere, and because Gey had given them so generously, there was no real record of where they had all ended up.Deborah herself always lived in fear of inheriting her mother's cancer. Because of this she readily submitted to tests. Victor McKusick took blood samples, which Deborah believed were for ""cancer tests."" In fact though, Skloot claims, they were for his own research. This is another example of chronic misunderstanding. He knew of the family's mental anguish and the unfair treatment they had had. He thought she understood why he wanted the blood. He gave her an autographed copy of his book - a technical manual on Genetics. Of this, Deborah commented wryly, ""It would have been nice if he'd told me what the damn thing said too."" And again, ""I would like some health insurance so I don't got to pay all that money every month for drugs my mother cells probably helped to make.""In 2001, Skloot tells us, Christoph Lengauer, now the Head of Oncology in one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, said of Henrietta, ""Her cells are how it all started."" And to Deborah, ""Once there is a cure for cancer, it's definitely largely because of your mother's cells.""In 2005 the US government issued gene patents relating to the use of 20% of known human genes, including Alzheimer's, asthma, colon cancer and breast cancer. The injustices however, continue. Pharmaceutical companies, scientists and universities now control what research is done, and the costs of the resulting tests and therapies. An example of how this continues to impede scientific development according to the author is that of the company Myriad Genetics, who hold the patent on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. (These are the genes which are responsible for most hereditary breast cancers.) The company had arbitrarily set a charge of $3000 to have this test, amid furore amongst scientists. They had licensed the use of the test. Anyone who ignored it received a threat of litigation. Eventually in 2009 they were sued by the American Civil Liberties Union, representing a huge number of people including 150,000 scientists for inhibiting research. The commercialisation of human biological materials has now become big business.There seems to have been some attempts at restitution since this book was published, the most recent being in August 2013. There was an agreement between the family and The National Institutes of Health to give the family some control over the access to the cells' DNA code, and a promise of acknowledgement on scientific papers. The committee set to oversee this arrangement will have 6 members, 2 of whom will be members of the family. The wheels have been set in motion.All in all this is an important and startlingly original book by a dedicated and compassionate author. It speaks to every one of us, regardless of our colour, nationality or class. Skloot admitted that it took a long time to decide the structure of the book, in order to include all the important aspects that she wished to. There are three sections: ""Life"", ""Death"" and ""Immortality"", plus an ""Afterword"". The main thrust throughout is clearly the enduring injustice the Lacks family suffered. So perhaps the final words should be Joe's, or (as he changed his name when he converted to Islam in prison), Zakariyya's: ""I believe what them doctors did was wrong. They lied to us for 25 years, kept them cells from us, then they gonna say them things DONATED by our mother. Them cells was stolen! Those fools come take blood from us sayin they need to run tests and not tell us that all these years they done profitized off of her…. You don't lie and clone behind their backs. That's wrong - it's one of the most violating parts of this whole thing….Then doctors say her cells [are] so important and did all this and that to help people. But it didn't do no good for her, and it don't do no good for us. If me and my sister need something, we can't even go and see a doctor cause we can't afford it.""It's too late for some of Henrietta's family. For how many others will it also be too late?"

Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, ""Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."" (Matthew 26:26-28, NIV Bible)From The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks: There's no way of knowing how many of Henrietta's cells are alive today. One scientist estimates that if you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown on a scale, they'd weigh more than 50 million metric tons--an inconceivable number, given that an individual cell weighs almost nothing....Her cells were part of research into the genes that cause cancer and those that suppress it; they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, and Parkinson's disease; and they've been used to study lactose digestion, sexually transmitted diseases, appendicitis, human longevity, mosquito mating, and the negative cellular effects of working in sewers....Like guinea pigs and mice, Henrietta's cells have become the standard laboratory workhorse.(The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, pp. 2-4)Questions:1) Assuming Jesus Christ was speaking literally, please calculate the total mass and volume of the Body of Christ consumed in the period between the Last Supper (c. 30-36 AD/CE) and the present day. Use only estimates for churches and denominations that preach Transubstantiation. Make sure to factor in such estimates as: average mass and volume of the Host and sacramental wine given per recipient, number of recipients per church, number of churches practicing Communion, number of ceremonies per year (approximate), and time elapsed since the Last Supper. Remember to SHOW YOUR WORK.2) Compare the Body of Christ to the Body of Henrietta Lacks. Is the size of the first greater than, lesser than, or equal to, the second?3) Compare growth rates and determine which is greater:a) Your answer in Question #1 over the past 1,980 years (approximate), orb) HeLa's growth since 1951Essay question:Does size really matter? If, in fact, the Body of Henrietta Lacks were larger than the Body of Christ, would that make her worthy of her own religion?Bonus:Pretend you are a prophet of this new religion.

But what happens when her biological material generates billions of dollars for the drug and pharmaceutical industry, leaving her dirt poor descendants in the lurch?Yeah, I know I wrote that like the teaser for one of my mysteries but the only mystery here is how people who have profited from the diseased cells that killed a woman can sleep at night while her kids and grand kids don't have two nickels to rub together.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is really two stories. One of Henrietta Lacks and her cancer cells that lived decades beyond her years, and the other of Rebecca Skloot and the surviving members of the Lacks family.Henrietta Lacks married her counsin, contracted multiple STD's due to his philandering ways, and died of misdiagnosed cervical cancer by the time she was 30. However, the cancer that killed her survives today in the form of HeLa cells, which have been taken to the moon, exposed to every manner of radiation and illness, and all sorts of other experiments. While other people are raking in money due to the HeLa research, the surviving Lacks family doesn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of, bringing me to the real meat of the book: The pharmaceutical industry is a bunch of dickbags. Imagine having something removed that generated billions of dollars of revenue for people you've never met and still needing to watch your budget so you can pay your mortage. Fair? Shit no, but that's the way it is, apparently. It also seems illogical that you can patent things you didn't create but again, that's the way the cookie crumbles.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an eye-opening look at someone most of us have never heard of but probably owe some sort of debt to. Also, it drags the big money pharma companies out in the sun. Sadly, they do not burst into flames like the vampires they are. Four out of five stars. I'm going to go read something happy now."
105,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,5,"The gift of life is surely the greatest gift of all. So how can the story of the remarkable woman who gave that gift over and over again to millions of people have been overlooked for so long?In 1951 a poor African American woman in Maryland became an uninformed donor to medical science. Henrietta Lacks died at age 31 of cervical cancer at John Hopkins hospital in Baltimore. Then doctors discovered that tumor cells they had removed from her body earlier continued to thrive in the lab - a medical first.Before long, her cells, dubbed HeLa cells, would be used for research around the world, contributing to major advances in everything from cancer treatments to vaccines; from aging to the life cycle of mosquitoes; nuclear bomb explosions to effect of gravity on human tissue during flights to outer space. An estimated 50 million metric tons of her cells were reproduced; thousands of careers have been build, and initiated more than 60 000 scientific studies until now, but Henrietta Lacks never gave permission for that research, nor had her family.In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca Skloot gracefully tells the story of the real woman and her descendants; the history of race-related medical research, including the role of eugenics; the struggles of the Lacks family with poverty, politics and racial issues; the phenomenal development of science based on the HeLa cells, in a language that can be understood by everyone. She combined the family's story with the changing ethics and laws around tissue collection, the irresponsible use of the family's medical information by journalists and researchers and the legislation preventing the family from benefiting from it all.COMMENTSI was gifted this book in December but never realized the impact it had internationally, neither would have on me. Until I finished reading it last night, I did not know it was an international bestseller, as well as read by so many of my GR friends! It was total surprise, since nonfiction is normally not a regular star on bestseller lists, right?The debate around the moral issue, and the experiences of the poor family were very well presented in the book, which was truly well written and objective as far as possible. For me personally, the question of how this woman, who basically saved millions of people's lives, were overlooked, is answered in the arrogance of scientists who deemed it unnecessary to respect the rights of people unable to fend for themselves.The ethical and moral dilemmas it created in America, when the family became aware of their mother's contribution to science without anyone's knowledge or consent, just enabled the commercial enterprises who benefited massively from her cells, to move to other countries where human rights are just a faint star in a unlimited universe. The Lacks family drew a line in the sand of how far people must be exploited in America. Unfortunately the medical fraternity just moved their operations elsewhere.Tissue and organ harvesting thrive in the world, it is globally a massive industry, with the poorest of the poor still the uninformed donors. An open secret. There are numerous stories, especially in India, where people wake up and realize they were operated on and one of their organs is missing. Stolen. By the time they became aware of it, the organ had already been transplanted in America and elsewhere in the world. That's no secret. Everything is justified as long as science is involved.  Nowadays people in other parts of the world sell their organs, even though it is illegal in most countries. According to American laws people cannot sell their tissue, which is part of human organs? People can donate it though, then it is acceptable.Yet someone else can patent your cells, but you're not allowed to be compensated, since the minute it leaves your body, it is regarded as waste, disposed of, and therefor not deemed your 'property' anymore. Huh?This book was a good and necessary read. The human interest side of it, telling the story of the family was eye-opening and excellent. A little bit of melodramatic, but how else would it become a bestseller, if ordinary readers like us could not relate to it. It was very well-written indeed. Thanks to Rebecca Skloot, in 2010, sixty years later, HeLa now has a history, a face and an address. Finally, Henrietta Lacks, and not the anonymous HeLa, became a biological celebrity. In 1951 Dr. Grey's lab assistant handled yet just another tissue sample of hundreds, when she received Henrietta's to prepare for research. She named it HeLa(first two letters of the patient's name and last name). But a few months later she visited the body of the deceased Henrietta Lacks in the mortuary to collect more samples. When she saw the woman's red-painted toenails, a lightbulb went on.Mary Kubicek: “Oh jeez, she’s a real person. . . . I started imagining her sitting in her bathroom painting those toenails, and it hit me for the first time that those cells we’d been working with all this time and sending all over the world, they came from a live woman. I’d never thought of it that way.”John Hopkins hospital could have considered naming a wing of their research facilities after Henrietta Lack. Why don't they?Nevertheless, this book should be read by everybody. Without it the world would have been a lot poorer and less human.The world has a lot to answer for.RECOMMENDED for sure!EDIT I googled the Lacks family and landed upon the website of the Lacks Foundation, which was started by Rebecca Skloot. http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/That news TOTALLY made my day. I wish them all the best and hope they will succeed in their goals and dreams. A wonderful initiative. Just imagine what can be accomplished if every single person, organization, research facility and medical company who benefitted for Henrietta Lacks's tissue cells, donate only $1 (one single dollar)? Yes, just imagine that!So many positive things happened to the family after the book was published. It just brings tears of joy to my eyes.http://www.lacksfamily.net/index.phpAnd finally: May 29, 2010A Historic Day: Henrietta Lacks’s Long Unmarked Grave Finally Gets a Headstonethanks to Dr. Roland Pattillo at Morehouse School of Medicine, who donated a headstone after reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks."
106,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,5,"There are some books that I finish and am left in awe, questioning everything that I thought I knew on a subject. Or, as is the case hear, having learned so much about which I knew nothing. My jaw is still on the floor after I finished this book and I can only imagine the controversies and discussions it might provoke. A thank you goes out to three Goodreads friends who recommended that I read this book and open an avenue for discussion. Aven, Brenda, and Rae, I hope we can begin a wild and intriguing dialogue, pulling others into the mix as things gain momentum.Who was Henrietta Lacks? What are HeLa cells? These are two of the foundational questions that Rebecca Skloot sought to answer in this poignant biographical piece. While I have tackled a number of biographies in my time as a reader, Skloot offered a unique approach to the genre in publication. Henrietta Lacks grew up in rural Virginia, picking tobacco and made ends meet as best she could. After marrying, she had a brood of children, including two of note, Elsie and Deborah, whose significance becomes apparent as the reader delves deeper into the narrative. Skloot offered up a succinct, but detailed narrative of how Lacks found an unusual mass inside her and was sent from her doctor to a specialist at Johns Hopkins (yes, THAT medical centre) for treatment. The mass was malignant and Lacks was deemed to have cervical cancer. Her surgeon, following the precedent of many doctors in the early 1950s, took samples of her tumour as well as that of the healthy part of her cervix, hoping to be able to have the cells survive so they could be analysed. Past attempts by doctors and scientists failed to keep cells alive for very long, which led to the constant slicing and saving technique used by those in the medical profession, when the opportunity arose. As it turns out, Lacks' cells were not only fascinating to explore, but George Gey (Head of Tissue Culture Research at Johns Hopkins) noticed that they lasted indefinitely, as long as they were properly fed. Gey realised that he had something on his hands and tried to get approval from the Lacks family, though did so in an extremely opaque manner. After Lacks succumbed to the cancer, doctors sought to perform an autopsy, which might allow them complete access to Lacks' body. Ignorant of what was going on, Henrietta's husband agreed, thinking that this was only to ensure his children and subsequent generations would not suffer the agony that cancer brought upon Henrietta. So began the conniving and secretive nature of George Gey. He harvested these 'special cells' and named them ""HeLa"", a brief combination of the original patient's two names. Their phenomenal growth and sustainability led him to ship them all over the country and eventually the world, though the Lacks family had no idea this was going on. HeLa cells were studied to create a polio vaccine (Jonas Salk used them at the University of Pittsburgh), helped to better understand cellular reactions to nuclear testing, space travel, and introduction of cancer cells into an otherwise healthy body during curious and somewhat inhumane tests on Ohio inmates. During all this, Johns Hopkins remained completely aware of what was going on and the transmission of HeLa cells around the globe, though did not think to inform the Lacks family, perhaps for fear that they would halt the use of these HeLa cells. Through the use of the term 'HeLa' cells, no one was the wiser and no direct acknowledgement of the long-deceased Henrietta Lacks need be made. Skloot provided much discussion about the uses, selling, 'donating', and experimenting that took place, including segments of the scientific community in America that were knowingly in violation of the Nuremberg Rules on human experimentation, though they danced their own legal jig to get around it all. The crux of the biography lay on this conundrum, though it would only find its true impact by exploring the lives of those Henrietta Lacks left behind after her death.Skloot took the time to pepper chapters with the history of the Lacks family as they grew up and, eventually, what happened when they were made aware that the HeLa cells existed, over two decades after they were obtained and Henrietta had died. Skloot split this other biographical piece into two parts, which eventually merge into one, documenting her research trips and interviews with the family alongside the presentation of a narrative that explores the fruits of those sit-down interviews. That Skloot tried to remain somewhat neutral is apparent, though through her connection to Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah, there was an obvious bias that developed. Superimposing these two narratives would, hopefully, offer the reader a chance to feel a personal connection to the Lacks family and the struggles they went through. In her discussions of the Lacks family, Skloot pulled no punches and presented the raw truths of criminal activity, abuse, addiction, and poverty alongside happy gatherings and memories of Henrietta. No biographical piece would be complete if it were only window dressing and trying to paint a rosy picture of this maligned family without offering at least a little peek into their daily lives. However, it balanced out and Skloot ended up with what the reader might call a decent introduction to this run of the mill family unit. Their ire at being duped by Johns Hopkins was apparent, alongside the dichotomy that HeLa cells were so popular, yet the family remained in dire poverty in the poor areas of Baltimore.The legal ramifications of HeLa cell usage was discussed at various points in the book, though there was no firm case related to it, at least not one including the Lacks family. One person I know sought to draw parallels between the Lacks situation and that of Carrie Buck, as illustrated wonderfully in Adam Cohen's book, Imbeciles (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...). While the courts surely fell short in codifying ownership of cells and research done on them, the focus of Skloot's book was the social injustice by Johns Hopkins, not the ineptitude of the US Supreme Court, as Cohen showed while presenting Buck v. Bell to the curious audience. While George Gey vowed that he gave away the HeLa cell samples to anyone who wanted them, surely the chain reaction and selling of them in catalogues thereafter allowed someone to line their pockets. Skloot offers up numerous mentions from the family, usually through Deborah, that the Lacks family was not seeking to get rich off of this discovery of immortal cells. While companies were spending millions and profiting billions from the early testing of HeLa cells, no one in the family could afford to see a doctor or purchase the medicines they needed (all of which came about because of tests HeLa cells facilitated!). It is both fascinating and angering to see the system wash their hands of the guilt related to immoral collecting and culturing of these HeLa cells. Skloot did explore the slippery slope of cells and tissue as discarded waste, as well as the need for consent in testing them, something the reader ought to spend some time exploring once the biographical narrative ends. It is sure to confound and confuse even the most well-grounded reader.The latter chapters touched upon the aptly used word from the title ""Immortal"" as it relates to Henrietta Lacks. Be it a biography that placed a story behind the woman, a detailed discussion of how the HeLa cell came into being and how its presence is all over the medical world, or that medical advancements as we know them will allow Henrietta Lacks' being to live on for eternity, the reader can reflect on which rationale best suits them. While there is a religious undertone in the biography as it relates to this, Christianity is not inculcated into the reader's mind, as it was not when Skloot learned about these things.Do I know Henrietta Lacks any better now, after Skloot completed her work? Most definitely! Can I, a complete scientific dunce, better understand HeLa cells and the idea behind cell growth and development? Completely! Do I feel there was an injustice done to the Lacks family by Johns Hopkins in 1951 and for decades to come? Yes, I do harbour a strong resentment to the duplicitous attitude undertaken by a hospital whose founder sought to ensure those who could not receive medical care on their own be helped and protected. Is there a lingering legal argument to be made for compensatory damages or at least some fiduciary responsibility owed to the Lacks family? That is a very grey area for me, only further complicated by the legal discussions in the Afterward and the advancement of new and complicated scientific discoveries, which also bore convoluted legal arguments. I will say this... Skloot brought Henrietta Lacks to life and if that puts a face to those HeLa cells, perhaps all those who read this book will think twice about those medicines used in their bodies and the scientific breakthroughs that are attributed to many powerful companies and/or nations. Maybe then, Henrietta can live on in all of us, immortal in some form or another.Kudos, Madam Skloot for intriguing someone whose scientific background is almost nil. You brought numerous stories to life and helped me see just how powerful one woman can be, silenced by death and the ignorance of what those around her were doing.Like/hate the review?

Her story is a heartbreaking one, but also an important one as her cancer cells, forever to be known as HeLa taken without her consent or knowledge, saved thousands of lives.Through ten long years of investigative work by this author, this narrative explores the experimental, racial and ethical issues of HeLa (the cells that would not die), while intertwining the story of her children's lives and the utter shock of finding out about their mother's cells more than twenty years later.""Physician Seeks Volunteers For Cancer Research."" Yeah, right........So many parts of this book made me sick to my stomach.....like the uncaring treatment of animals and all the poor souls injected with cancer cells without their knowledge in the name of research and greed; and oh, dam Ethel for the inhumane and brutal abuse to Henrietta's children too. Unbelievable!Whew! I must admit to being glad when I turned the last page on this one, but big time kudos to Rebecca Skloot for researching and telling Henrietta's story. She deserved so much better."
108,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,4,"Overall, a four star read that should probably be required reading for both biology and American history classes. (Actually, it was a far more interesting read than that makes it sound). While I had heard a great deal of buzz on the book, I wasn't prepared for how the story evolved. The book alternates between Henrietta Lacks' personal history, that of her family, a little of medical history and Skoot's actual pursuit of the story, which helps develop the story in historical context. Skoots included a lot more science than I expected, and even with ten years in the medical field, I was horrified at times. Skoots does a decent job of maintaining a journalistic tone, but some of the things she relates are terrible, from the way Henrietta grew up to cervical cancer treatment in the 50s and 60s. These were the days before cancer treatments approached the precision medicine it is aiming for today, and the treatments resembled nothing so much as trying to cut fingernails with garden shears. Just the thought of a radioactive seed tucked in the uterus causing tissue burn was enough to give me sympathetic cramps.Part of the evil in the book is the violence her family inflicted on each other, and it's one of the truly uncomfortable areas. I think that discomfort is important, because part of where this story comes from has to do with slavery and poverty. There isn't really an ethical high ground here, and that's part of Skoot's skill in setting up the story, and part of the problem in being a white woman telling the story of a black woman. The only reason I didn't give this a five star rating is that the narrative started to fall apart at the end, leaving behind the stories of the cell line and focus more on the breakdown of Henrietta's daughter, Deborah. While I understand she is the touchstone for the story, that she is partly telling the story of the mother through the daughter, much of Henrietta and the science is sidelined.Interesting questions popped up while reading; namely, why does everyone equate Henrietta's cancer cells with her person? As an illustration, if you tell people they have a cancerous tumor, the reaction is ""get rid of it."" It is categorized as ""other"" in everyone's mind and not recognized it as an intrinsic part of the person with cancer. It is not ""them."" Biologically speaking, I'm not sure the book answered the question of whether of not the HeLa cells actually were genetically identical to Henrietta, or if they were mutated--altered DNA. While that might be cold comfort, it's a huge philosophical and scientific question that is the pivot point for a number of issues. Treating the cells as if they were ""normal"" is part of what lead the scientists into disaster as evidenced by the discovery that so many cell lines were HeLa contaminated (I don't believe that transmission mechanism was explained either, which irks me). It also could be the basis for a sophisticated legal and ethical argument."
109,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani,4,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca SklootThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (2010) is a non-fiction book by American author Rebecca Skloot. Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead in 1951. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سی و یکم ماه آگوست سال 2014 میلادیعنوان: حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس؛ نویسنده: ربکا اسکلاوت (اسکلوت)؛ مترجم: حسین راسی؛ تهران آرامش‏‫، 1390؛ در 426ص؛ شابک 9789649219165؛ موضوع: هنرییتا لکس از سال 1920م تا 1951م؛ بیماران و سرطان - اخلاق پزشکی - کشت یاخته ها - آزمایش روی انسان - سده 21م‬زندگینامه ی بیماری به نام «هنرییتا لکس» است، نامش «هنریتا لکس» بود، اما دانشمندان ایشان را با نام «هلا» میشناسند؛ یک کشاورز تنباکوی فقیر جنوب بود، که در همان سرزمین اجداد برده ی خود، کار میکردند، اما سلولهایش - که بدون آگاهی ایشان گرفته شده - به یکی از مهمترین ابزارهای پزشکی تبدیل شد؛ نخستین سلولهای «جاودانه»ی انسانی که، رشد یافته اند، و امروز هنوز هم زنده هستند، اگرچه ایشان در سال 1951میلادی درگذشته اند؛ اگر بتوانیم همه ی سلولهای «هلا» را که تکثیر شده اند، وزن کنیم، شاید وزن آنها به بیش از پنجاه میلیون تن برسد؛ سلولهای «هلا» برای ایجاد «واکسن فلج اطفال» حیاتی بودند؛ سلولهای ایشان، پرده از اسرار «سرطان»، «ویروسها» و اثرات «تشعشعات بمب اتم»؛ برداشتند؛ همچنین پیشرفتهایی همانند: «لقاح آزمایشگاهی»، «کلونینگ» و «نقشه برداری ژن»، یاری کرده است؛ و توسط میلیاردها انسان خریداری و فروخته شده اند؛ با اینحال «هنریتتا لکس» ناشناخته مانده، و در یک گور نامشخص دفن شده استاین کتاب به بخش‌های: برخورد اخلاق در حرفه پزشکی با نژادپرستی، و محرومیت‌های «تاریخی- اجتماعی» رنگین پوستان، برخورد جنبه‌ های معنوی، و حقوقی مالکیت بافت‌های بدن انسان، به تنگدستی و خرافات‌، و برخورد با اکتشاف‌ها، راهکارها، و شیوه ‌های نوین پزشکی هم پرداخته، و نکاتی خواندنی را پیش روی خوانشگر میگذارد؛ «حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس»: صحبت‌ها، یادمانهای نزدیکان «لکس»، و نگاهی به اسناد قانونی، و پرونده‌های پزشکی ایشان نیز هست؛ نگارنده، در این نوشتار علاوه بر نگارش تاریخچة زندگی «هنریتیا لکس» به معرفی «سلول‌های هیلا» و پاسخ‌گویی به پرسش‌‌هایی درباره ی دانش پزشکی، اخلاق، نژاد، و طبقه‌ بندی اجتماعی نیز، پرداخته استا. شربیانی"
110,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6050722-rachel,5,"Full disclosure: I come to this book from a weirdly fortuitous place. Take my brief, but mind-searing, stint in gynecologic oncology research ca. 2002, which involved a weekly trek to the OR to pick up still-warm tumors, with the women who informedly consented to donate them often open on the table as I did so. Then throw in two years working in a tissue culture hood, two more in a narrative nonfiction book group, and another big chunk of time studying infectious diseases. Mix in interests in social justice, bioethics, the history of science, and mysteries, and you’ve got me primed for some outsized adoration of Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, because its three main narratives are: 1) The history of tissue culture, particularly the contribution of the “immortal,” fabulously prolific HeLa cells that revolutionized medical research.2) The life, disease and death of Henrietta Lacks, the woman whose cervical cancer cells gave rise to the HeLa cell line.3) The story of Henrietta Lacks’s impoverished family, particularly her daughter Deborah, belatedly discovering and coping with their mother’s cellular legacy.Intertwined with all three is the concept of informed consent in scientific research, and who owns those bits of us and our genetic information that are floating around the research world. See? That perfect scientific/bioethical/historical mystery doesn’t come along every day. My expectations for this one were absolutely sky-high. And Rebecca Skloot hit it higher than that pile of 89 zillion HeLa cells. Thing is, my particular background can make reading about science kind of painfully bifurcated. I mean first, you’ve got your books that are all, “Yay! Science is totally objective and awesome and will solve all of our problems, so just shut up and trust it already!!” But then you’ve definitely also got your, “Science is just one (over-privileged and socially influenced) way of knowing among many / Medicine is patriarchal and wicked and economically motivated and pretty much out to get you, so avoid it at all costs” books too.Yes, Skloot could have written the story of a poor, black, female victim of evil white scientists. But she didn’t do that. Given her interests, it’s conceivable she could have written the triumphant history of tissue culture, and the amazing medical breakthroughs made possible by HeLa cells, and thank you for playing, poorblackwomanwhomnobodyknows. But she didn’t do that either. Instead, she spent ten years researching and writing a balanced, multifaceted book about the humans doing the science, the human whose cells made the science possible, and the humans profoundly affected by the actions of both. Her book is a complex tangle of race, class, gender and medicine. Of reason and faith. Of knowledge and ethics. Of the chasm between the beneficiaries of medical innovation and those without healthcare in the good old US of A.And Skloot doesn’t have the answers. We don’t get to tut-tut at how much things sucked in the past, while patting ourselves on the back for living in the enlightened present. This is vital and messy stuff, here. The problems haven’t been fixed. Who owns our pieces is an issue that is very much alive, and, with the current onslaught of new genetic information, becoming livelier by the minute. Which is why I would feel comfortable recommending this book to anyone involved in human-subjects research in any capacity...so a boatload of us, really, whether we know it or not.But, buyer beware: to tackle all this three-pronged complexity, Skloot uses a decidedly non-linear structure, one with a high narrative leaps:book length ratio. The three main narratives unfold together and inform each other: we meet Deborah Lacks, while learning about the fate of her mother, while learning about what HeLa cells can do, while learning about tissue culture innovators, while learning about the fate of Deborah Lacks. And Skloot saves the nuts and bolts of informed consent and the ownership of biological materials for a densely packed Afterward. Me, I found this to be a powerful structure and ate it all up with a spoon, but I can see how it could be a bit frustrating. You should also know that Skloot is in the book. According to Skloot herself, she fought against this for years. But you know what? I think she needs to be there. This is a book about adding the human complexity back into an illusion of objective scientific truth. When the author has become a character in the lives of her subjects, influencing events in their lives, it works to have the author be a textual presence disrupting the illusion of the objective journalistic truth. She only appears when it’s relevant to her subjects’ story; you don’t hear anything about her story that doesn’t pertain to theirs. And having been in that narrative nonfiction book group for two years, Skloot’s stands out as an elegant and thoughtful approach to the author/subject connection (self-reported femme-fatale author of The Angel of Grozny: Orphans of a Forgotten War, I’m looking at you so hard right now.)
This book pairs well with:
 The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures, another excellent, non-judgmental book about the intersection of science, medicine and culture. With The Mismeasure of Man, for more on the fallibility of the scientific process. It would also taste really good with a kick-ass book about the history of biomedical ethics in the United States, so if you know of one, I’d love to hear about it!"
111,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"I am late to this book party, but let me explain: I get twitchy about medical stuff. Earlier this year I had to abandon Rosemary Mahoney's book about the blind because it described an eye surgery. I have never been able to finish Dr. Atul Gawande's Complications because of its description of medical procedures. It was a small miracle that I was able to finish the Call the Midwife series, because I hate childbirth scenes. When this Henrietta Lacks book started tearing up the bestseller lists a few years ago, I read a few reviews and thought, ""Yeah, that can wait.""Then I started a new library job, and the Lacks book was chosen as a Common Read for the campus. Guess who was volun-told to help lead upcoming book discussions? (Hint: it was me.)So, with a deep sigh, I started reading. And then, oh happy day, my fears turned out to be unfounded because I ended up really liking the story. Rebecca Skloot wrote that she first heard about Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells in a community college biology class. Lacks was a black woman who died in 1951 from cervical cancer. Before she died, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. A key part of this story is that Henrietta did not know her tissue had been taken, and doctors did not tell her family.Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in culture for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal cells ever grown in a laboratory.Henrietta's cells, nicknamed HeLa, were given to scientists and researchers around the world, and they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, Parkinson's disease, and they helped with innumerable other medical studies over the decades. At first, the cells were given for free, but some companies were set up to sell vials of HeLa, which became a lucrative enterprise. The reason Henrietta's cells were so precious was because they allowed scientists to perform experiments that would have been impossible with a living human. They cut HeLa cells apart and exposed them to endless toxins, radiation, and infections. They bombarded them with drugs, hoping to find one that would kill malignant cells without destroying normal ones. They studied immune suppression and cancer growth by injecting HeLa cells into immune-compromise rats, which developed malignant tumors much like Henrietta's. If the cells died in the process, it didn't matter -- scientists could just go back to their eternally growing HeLa stock and start over again.Unfortunately, the Lacks family did not know about any of this until several decades after Henrietta had died, and some relatives became very upset and felt betrayed by the doctors at Hopkins. A few threatened to sue the hospital, but never did.There is a lot of biology and medical discussion in this book, but Skloot also tried to learn more about Henrietta's life, and she was able to interview Lacks' relatives and children. Additionally, there is some good discussion on the ethics of taking tissue samples from patients without their consent, and on the problem of racism in health care.""I always have thought it was strange, if our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can't afford to see no doctors? Don't make no sense. People got rich off my mother without us even known about them takin her cells now we don't get a dime. I used to get so mad about that to where it made me sick and I had to take pills. But I don't got it in me no more to fight. I just want to know who my mother was."" -- Deborath Lacks, who was very young when her mother diedMy favorite parts of the book were the stories about Henrietta and the Lacks family, and the discussions on race and ethics in health care. There's no indication that Henrietta questioned [her doctor]; like most patients in the 1950s, she deferred to anything her doctors said. This was a time when 'benevolent deception' was a common practice -- doctors often withheld even the most fundamental information from their patients, sometimes not giving them any diagnosis at all. They believed it was best not to confuse or upset patients with frightening terms they might not understand, like cancer. Doctors knew best, and most patients didn't question that. Especially black patients in public wards. This was 1951 in Baltimore, segregation was law, and it was understood that black people didn't question white people's professional judgment. Many black patients were just glad to be getting treatment, since discrimination in hospitals was widespread.Skloot worked on the book for more than a decade, paying for research trips with student loans and credit card debt. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in medical ethics, biology, or just some good investigative reporting. Favorite Quote""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different."" -- Deborah Lacks"
112,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61753513-christy,5,"I do believe this book must have scored near the top of all books used in college courses these last 5-6 years - from English to history and social sciences, but I wonder how much traction it got in medical school and across the healthcare and medical research fields. It quickly became a ""classic"" because so many issues are covered: race, class, gender, genetics, property rights, and about the social ends of science and our technological choices. As well, it's a story of how some people are used by institutions for other ends, whether admirably or not, and how unjust and unfair it was to Henrietta to have her cancer cells taken without her permission. She died at age 31 from the cancer, yet the gene treatment her cells produced is tremendously useful in the medical field and will be for a long time to come, hence her ""immortal"" status, yet it gives little comfort to the reader. Ironically, her own family now suffers from a lack of access to healthcare.Kudos to author Skloot who started a the Henrietta Lacks Foundation to help families like the Lacks with healthcare and other financial needs, including more victims of similar experiences, including those of the infamous Tuskeegee experiment with treating only some Black soldiers with syphilis. You can check it out at http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/"
113,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020736-stacey,5,"I've started and erased my little book commentary so many times because this story is so overwhelming and so important on multiple levels, I'm not sure anything I could say about it would do justice to the complexity and dichotomy of the story surrounding Henrietta Lacks. It might not be far from the truth to state that she was the most important person who ever lived. A physical part of her body has saved hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of lives, and improved the lives of countless others. And her story is not over yet. Her cells are still being used in medical research all over the world. But these benefits came at the cost of a violation of her rights, in a time when it was commonplace for doctors and researchers to just do and take, without consent, especially among poor populations and people of color. Some of the things done with Henrietta's cells saved lives, some were heinous experiments performed on people who had no idea what was being done to them, in a grotesquely distorted and amplified reflection of what was done to Henrietta. Nuremberg was dismissed in the United States as something that only applied to the fallen Nazi's. Any act was justifiable in the name of science. And yet, some of the things done right her in our own nation were reminiscent of the research being conducted under the direction of the notorious Dr. Mengele.Reading certain parts of this book, I found myself holding my breath in horror at some of the ideas conjured by medical practioners in the name of “research.” Of course, we know.* Anyone who is even moderately informed on this nation's medical history knows about the Tuskegee trials, MK Ultra, flu and hepatitis research on the disabled and incarcerated, radiation exposure experiments on hospital patients, and cancer, cancer, cancer. The poor, disabled and people of color in this country, the “land of the free,” have been subjected to so many cancer experiments, it defies belief. Many of these trials, including some devised of Henrietta's cells, have involved injecting cancer, non-consensually, into human subjects. So while it is true that there can be utterly no doubt that our lives, and the lives of much of the world, are better, because of the knowledge made possible by parts of Henrietta Lacks's body, still acknowledgment of this reality comes at the cost of knowing that procedures were performed on her without her knowledge or understanding, and without her consent, with impunity; these actions were made even easier because she was poor, black and female, and this is to say nothing of the numerous and unethical violations of her (and her children's) privacy. It's an old story. It's a story that her biographer, Rebecca Skloot, handles with grace and compassion. Henrietta is not some medical spectacle, she was a real woman. If she has been deified by her friends and family since her death, it is maybe the homage that she deserves, not for her cells, but for her vibrance, kindness, and the tragedy of a mother who died much too young. There are a great many scientific and historical facts presented in this book, facts that I couldn't possibly vet for veracity, but the science seems sound, if simplistic, and the history is presented in a conversational way, that is easy to read, and uninterrupted by footnotes and references. Family recollections are presented in storyteller fashion, which makes for easy and compelling reading. Fact-checking is made easy by a list of references, presented in chapter-by-chapter appendices. Rarely do I read something that makes me want to collar strangers in the street and tell them, “You MUST read this book,” but this is one of those times. Henrietta's story is bigger than medical research, and cures for polio, and the human genome, and Nuremberg. Henrietta's story is about basic human rights, and autonomy, and love. It's about knowledge and power, how it's human nature to find a way to justify even the worst things we can devise in the name of the greater good, and how we turn our science into a god. This story is bigger than Rebecca Skloot's book. But I am grateful that she wrote it, and thankful to have read it. Would the story have changed had Henrietta been given the opportunity to give her informed consent? That's the thread of mystery which runs through the entire story, the answer to which we can never know. *documentation in this list is inconsistent, but most of these experiments can be independently verified."

115,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,4,"A lot to process with this book. This book's been out for a while, so I'm just going to put down a bunch of thoughts rattling around in my head, and probably leave it at that:-legacy left by slavery and how it affected Henrietta Lacks and the members of her family, and African Americans in general (where they lived, what kind of employment was available to them, the quality of education available to them, the history of abuse and violence, and the impact on their mental health, and the quality and availability of healthcare)-the assumptions and treatment by the medical establishment, at the time, of their patients and patients' rights-the lack of laws, or their lack of clarity, around a patient's consent, and the ownership of a patient's waste products from medical procedures. This was well illustrated in this book, from the 1950s to the time of the book's publication. -the quality of scientific education and knowledge in the general public. Unless people have some understanding of science, how are they to know what questions to ask of their doctors? The more affluent will generally fare better here, I suspect, what with their access to probably better trained teachers, and the ability to get higher education. And affluence and better outcomes would be partially dependent on where one started out in life.-thank goodness medical procedures improve over time, or are retired in favour of treatments that work!!-bioethics--thank goodness there is debate and evolution of ideas and laws. Though there are probably still lots of grey areas around research and commercializations -I was interested to find out more about the point raised about the DNA of the cell descendants of Henrietta's original cancerous cells.-I was sickened by the treatment, or perhaps I should say mystery around the treatment of Elsie, Henrietta's eldest daughter at the hospital for the insane. Or what doctors could call insane at the time.This was a painful read, but an important accounting of a part of US history, and more specifically, the legacy of slavery on a family, and the changing attitudes and practices in medicine and science."
116,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"I am not sure how is it in other countries but here in the Philippines, if you bring your car for repair in a service center and the serviceman says that he replaced a part, you how to do in you should find that replaced part inside your car. I think it is their proof that they actually replaced that part and also for you to decide how you want to dispose, resell, reuse or recycle it. Normally, this practice bothers me because I have a very small space for junks at home and I do not know what to do with a malfunctioning compressor, air vent, axle, mudguard, leaking pipes, tubes, coolant container, etc. What am I going to do with them? The only thing I know w.r.t. car is how to replace the battery or a flat tire. So, I always end up giving those away to the poor junk man so as to have something to load in his pushcart.It may not be the best analogy to introduce a very compelling book like this. However, the logic is the same. The organ, tissue, cells or fluids that you left in the hospital during your last hospitalization or check-up is totally different from the car spare parts. But both are left after you get what you want and you think they are of no use to you anymore. You gave the authorization for the part to be removed and replaced (if possible) and you deserve to have the replaced unit because legally, you are still the owner of the original or replaced part. However, just like me and the car junks, I would imagine that you don't want to bring home with you some test tubes filled with your excess coagulated blood, liquified Chlorox-smelling semen, miniscule torn ligaments or decayed tooth. What are you going to do with them? Henrietta Lacks, a poor black Tobacco farmer, died of cervical cancer in 1951. Without her knowledge, the doctors got her cancerous tissue and tried to use its cells in a cell culture. Surprise. Surprise. Henrietta's cells propagate like wild fire and they are still alive up to now. It was the first successful cell culture since in all the previous attempts, the cells only lived for few days before dying. The book explains that in Henrietta's chromosomes has enzyme called telomerase that continuously rebuils the telomere which is a string of DNA found at the end of each of Henrietta's chromosome. Skloot says in her introduction that there is more to this, as well as other issues, but apologizes for not excluding them in this book's scope. That's fine with me, because the scientific discussions in the book are just enough for me not to fall asleep and lose interest. We all took Biology in high school and the Cell and its parts, how they work, etc is always that's subject's first lesson so I think you can get by.So what if Henrietta's cells are still alive today? Medical discoveries still happen and we don't know or don't care to know their history. Well, those cells have been used to developed vaccines for polio, gene mapping, cloning, etc. So? Well, Henrietta's cancer cells were used without her or her families consent. Henrietta died 2 weeks after being diagnosed with cervical cancer and she was so poor she had to be buried in an unmarked grave. So? Well, Henrietta was black and the doctors were white. In the 50's, America was still not so open with mixing the two colors. The whites probably would not want to have anything in their body taken from a black person. So? This book tackles a number of controversial questions on medical ethics, racism and social discrimination. However, this is not a serious boring book. Skloot's storytelling does not leave any tinge of textbook formality and this can be read just like any A-grade medical crime bestseller that has some sprinklings of family drama (Henrietta's children have to be given away to relatives after her death), incest (10-y/o Rebecca, Henrietta's daughter, escapes a horny uncle showing his erect penis and she does not know the meaning of a rigid penis) and the struggles of a black family despite having a world-renowned mother whose cells, called the HeLa cells, make a unprecedented contribution to the medical field and in prolonging our life expectancy.So? Well, what if the same thing happens to you? What are the chances that your excess semen was not put in the wastebasket but stored in a sperm bank and given away to childless couples for in vitro fertilization of the wife's ovum? Then what if that child becomes the new Einstein? a new Picasso? a new Shakespeare? a new G.G.Marquez? I'm just saying...  "
117,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3893454-christina,4,"This was an interesting read. While I applaud Skloot's attempt to present a fair look at the history of the HeLa cell line used in research labs all over the world, the book is clearly skewed toward sympathy for the family. Not that they don't deserve sympathy, but really, the problems of the family is NOT the fault of anyone involved with the cell line. Don't get me wrong, Henrietta and her family have had a hard life, and they do deserve some sympathy. But not for this particular issue.The sad fact is that Henrietta died of an aggressive cancer, leaving her family to live their lives without her. That was not her fault or the fault of her family, but it was also not the fault of the hospital staff of Johns Hopkins. Yes, there was racial and socio-economic discrimination, but the fact remains that Henrietta was treated to best of the ability of the doctors at that time. Do we view the taking of cell samples from Henrietta without her permission as unethical today? Most people would say yes. But the law still remains unclear about that, and in 1954 that was most certainly not seen as unethical - it was common practice. So in the context of the time, the act was not unethical. As for monetary compensation, Johns Hopkins did not profit from the growth of HeLa cells; in fact, the scientist that first worked with HeLa cells GAVE the cells away to many many many other labs FOR FREE. Those labs shared with other labs, etc. Are there companies that profit from the cells now? Yes. But they got the cells the same way everyone else did back then - for free. The company then did their own research to find a way to mass produce, store and ship living cells. At the point the first company started mass producing and selling the cells the identity of the donor was long hidden, and the fact the cells were widespread at that time made them common property, so people in possession of the cells could do pretty much anything they wanted with them. And now for the part that is a little stickier - the family found out about Henrietta's cells, were (sort of) tricked into donating blood and cell samples and were kept in the dark about the cell line for decades. Was that right? NO, absolutely not. HOWEVER, I will point out that some of the subsequent anger, confusion and fear on the part of the family was due to their extreme lack of education rather than a malicious attempt to prey upon the Lacks family. The science presented in the book is simplified somewhat for the lay person, which is nice, as is the look at the advances in medicine and research that HeLa cells have brought to the world. As a scientist, however, I think that Skloot's explanations were a little fuzzy and did not really dispel most people's image of how science works in the real world. Perhaps a little more objectivity and less family bonding would have made this a better book.In conclusion: though Skloot claims she tries to give an unbiased view of the history of HeLa cells and the family from whence it came, I am concerned that lay people who read this will not understand some of the finer points and it will increase the already rampant fear of science that pervades American culture. The majority of Americans are woefully un-educated in the sciences, to the point that many people view it as no different than magic,but weirder and scarier. "
118,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1431828-nnedi,5,"What a wonderfully told story. Rebecca Skloot really came through on the research. She dug it alllllll up. And the way she told Henrietta's story was beautiful and almost reflective of Henrietta's life. The story started at a point and then spread out to become a story that enveloped all of humanity. I read this as more research on Henrietta for my forthcoming novel THE BOOK OF PHOENIX and it was exactly what I needed and wanted. I wanted the science but I also wanted the close personal narrative of this woman and the people in her life; I wanted the good, the bad and the ugly. This book was all of that. Some of it is lovely, some was disturbing, plenty of it as shocking, and lots of it was heart-breaking. Her story is so deeplyAmerican. Also, it was really cool how close the writer got to the narrative. and eventually became a part of it. I love that. Oh and there's a touch of African magic in the story, which didn't surprise me at ALL, considering what this book was about. <3'd this book!"
119,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer,4,"You know all those forms you have to fill out while waiting at the doctor and dentist office? The tedious, repetitious ones that you could have sworn you already completed at least a thousand times? Next time you sigh loudly or roll your eyes at the prospect of this task, think about the people who came before us who were never offered the luxury of informed consent, confidentiality, and protection from discrimination. Horrendous injustices prompted these forms into action so that history does not repeat itself. It's a sad thought.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks offers historical insight into human rights issues within the medical field. Primarily though, it focuses on the woman behind the most famous and widely researched human cells in the world: Henrietta Lacks. Her name has only recently become known to the world which is quite sad, but thanks to her family's perseverance and Rebecca Skloot's heavy research and publication, the world now knows who to credit with most medical advances to date. It has been reported that Ms. Lacks had no knowledge of her contribution, as she was unaware that tissues were saved after multiple cancer biopsies/treatments, and therefore, she gave no permission for her cells to be used in any way, shape, or form, but Ms. Skloot reminds us that even today, none of us have any say over what is done with our cells and tissues once removed from our bodies. I appreciated Ms. Skloot's attention to Ms. Lacks' remaining family members and their immense struggles in spite of all the progress (and profits) made in the medical field. In my opinion though, she was a bit too forthcoming in regards to the family. Factors related to race, poverty, education, medical issues, disabilities, and access to healthcare are definitely warranted in a book like this to show the overall contrast between those benefiting from Ms. Lacks' contribution and the family that was left behind, along with the insensitivity and injustice of it all. However, criminal histories, superstitions, and mental illness had no place in this book in my opinion. I believe this was potentially harmful to the family's character, and some portions of the book painted the family in a money-hungry and incompetent light which was unnecessary even if that may have been Ms. Skloot's perception or experience. Regardless, the family's inclusion in this book did make all the difference and I thoroughly enjoyed my reading experience.

As he shrieked and ran around looking for a mirror, I finally got to read the document.“This is a medical consent form. What’s going on?” I demanded as I shook the paper at him. Once he had combed and smoothed his hair back into perfection, Doe sighed.“Very well, Mr. Kemper. I guess I’ll have to come clean. Do you remember when you had your appendix out when you were in grade school?”“Sure. That gave me one of my better scars, but that was like 30 years ago. Why are you here now?” I asked.“You’re probably not aware of this, but your appendix was used in a research project by DBII,” Doe said.“Really? I assumed it just got incinerated or used in the hospital cafeteria’s meatloaf special. Why would anyone want to study my rotten appendix?”“Oh, all kinds of research is done on tissue gathered during medical procedures. Most people don’t know that, but it’s very common,” Doe said.“OK, but why are you here now?”“Well, your appendix turned out to be very special. It was secreting some kind of pus that no one had seen before. After many tests, it turned out to be a new chemical compound with commercial applications. So a patent was filed based on that compound and turned into a consumer product,” Doe admitted.“That sounds disgusting. What was it used in? Because I want to make sure to never buy it,” I said.“It’s the basis for the adhesive on Post-It Notes,” Doe said.“Are you freaking kidding me? Post-It Notes are based on my old appendix?”“I’m absolutely serious, Mr. Kemper. Now we at DBII need your help. Unfortunately for us, you haven’t had anything removed lately. So I have to get your consent if we’re going to do further studies,” Doe said.“But you already got my goo-seeping appendix. I don’t have another one,” I said. “True, but sales have been down for Post-It Notes lately. So after the marketing and research boys talked it over for a while, they thought we should bring you in for a full body scan. Maybe you’ve got a spleen giving out or something else that we could pull out and see if we could use it,” Doe said.“This is pretty damn disturbing,” I said.“Why? You’re an organ donor, right? Same thing,” Doe said.“I don’t consider someone lucking into an organ if the Chiefs win a play-off game and I have a goddamn heart attack the same thing as companies making money off tissue I had removed decades ago and didn’t know anything about,” I said.“Fortunately, the American government and legal system disagree. So how about it, Mr. Kemper? Will you come with me?” Doe asked.“I dunno. What’s my end of this? You already owe me a fat check for the Post-Its.”“Oh, no. You won’t get any money from the Post-Its, or if any future discoveries from your tissues lead to more gains.” Doe said.“That’s complete bullshit!”“Again, the legal system disagrees with you. But this is for science, Mr. Kemper. You don’t want to hold up medical scientific research that could save lives, do you?”“It’s for Post-It Notes!”“Maybe, but who is to say that the cure for some terrible disease isn't lurking somewhere in your genes? Could you live with yourself if you prevented crucial medical research just because you were ticked off that you didn’t get any money for your appendix? Remember that it’s not like you could have NOT had your appendix removed. At least, not if you wanted to keep living. And I highly doubt that you would have had the resources to have it studied and discovered the adhesive for yourself even if you would have taken it home with you in a jar after it was removed. We’re the ones who spent all that money to get some good out of a piece of disgusting gunk that tried to kill you. So shouldn’t we be compensated? What are you? Some kind of damn dirty hippie liberal socialist?” Doe said in disgust“You’re a hell of a corporate lackey, Doe,” I said.“Thank you.”“Fine. I’ll do it,” I said as I signed the form. “But I want some free Post-It Notes.”“No deal. Steal them from work like everyone else,” Doe said.******Obviously, I‘m a big fat liar and none of this happened, but I really did have my appendix out as a kid. Plus, my tonsils got yanked and I’ve had my fair share of blood taken over the years. What this book taught me is that it’s highly likely that some of my scraps are sitting in frozen jars in labs somewhere. Yours, too. If any of us have anything unique in our tissues that may be valuable for medical research, it’s possible that they’d be worth a fortune, but we’d never see a dime of it.Henrietta Lacks couldn’t be considered lucky by any stretch of the imagination. A black woman who grew up poor on a tobacco farm, she married her cousin and moved to the Baltimore area. Her husband apparently liked to step out on her and Henrietta ended up with STDs, and one of her children was born mentally handicapped and had to be institutionalized. In 1951, Henrietta was diagnosed with cervical cancer by doctors at Johns Hopkins. During her biopsy, cell samples were taken and given to a researcher who had been working on the problem of trying to grow human cells. Henrietta’s cancer spread wildly, and she was dead within a year. But her cells turned out to be an incredible discovery because they continued growing at a very fast rate. The doctor at Johns Hopkins started sharing his find for no compensation, and this coincided with a large need for cell samples due to testing of the polio vaccine. The HeLa cells would be crucial for confirming that the vaccine worked and soon companies were created to grow and ship them to researchers around the world. Since then, Henrietta’s cells have been sent into outer space and subjected to nuclear tests and cited in over 60,000 medical research papersUnfortunately, no one ever asked Henrietta’s permission and her family knew nothing about the important role her cells played in medicine for decades. Poor and with little formal education, Henrietta’s children were confused by what was actually done to their mother and upset when they learned that her tissue was part of a multi-million dollar industry that they‘ve received no compensation from..Rebecca Skloot has written a fascinating book that clearly outlines why Henrietta’s cells were so important, why she went unrecognized for decades, the pain it’s caused her family, and the way that new medical discoveries over the last sixty years have opened a potential Pandora’s Box of legal and ethical issues regarding tissue collection, research, patents and money. This book brings up a lot of issues that we’re probably all going to be dealing with in the future. Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog."
121,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"This is an all-gold five star read.It's actually two stories, the story of the HeLa cells and the story of the Lacks family told by a journalist who writes the first story objectively and the second, in which she is involved, subjectively. The contrast between the poor Lacks family who cannot afford their medical bills and the research establishment who have made millions, maybe billions from these cells is ironic and tragic. It has been established by other law cases that if the family had gone for restitution they would not have got it, but that's a moot point as they couldn't afford a lawyer in any case. I have seen some bad reviews about this book. People who think that the story of the Lacks - poor rural African-Americans who never made it 'up' from slavery and whose lifestyle of decent working class folk that also involves incest, adultery, disease and crime, they just dismiss with 'heard it all before' and 'my family despite all obstacles succeeded so what is wrong with the Lacks?' I wonder if these people who not only totally can't see the wonderful writing that brings these people to life and who so lack in compassion themselves are the sort of people who oppose health care for the masses? As an extremely wealthy American tourist once put it to me, he had earned good health care by his hard work and success in life, it was one of the perks, why waste good money on, say, a a triple-bypass on someone who hasn't even succeeded enough to afford health insurance? That they were a drain on society, non-contributors and not the way America needed to go to move forward.I don't think you can rate people by what they have achieved materially. Success depends a great deal on opportunity and many don't have that. Henrietta Lacks didn't have it and her children didn't have it, not even her grandchildren made much of a way for themselves, but the next generation, the great grandchildren - ah now they are going in for Masters degrees and maybe their children will be major contributors. The author intends to recompense the family by setting up a scholarship for at least one of them. All of us came originally from poverty and to put down those that are still mired in the quicksand of never having enough spare cash to finance an education is cruel, uncompassionate and hardly looking to the future.HeLa cells have given us our future. They are the most researched and tested human cells in existence. All of us have benefited from the medical advances made using them and the book is recognition of what a great contribution Henrietta Lacks and her family with all their donations of tissue and blood, mostly stolen from them under false pretences, have made. Indeed one of the researchers who looks like having told a lot of lies (and then lied about that) in order to get the family to donate blood to further her research is still trying to get them to donate more. She's a hard-nosed scientist, with an excellent job and income and to her the Lacks are no more than providers of raw material. Sometimes you can't make hard and fast rulings. No I don't think we should have to give informed consent for experiments to be done on tissue or blood donated during a procedure or childbirth - that would slow medical research unbearably. I don't think cells should be identifiable with the donor either, it should be quite anonymous (as it now is). However, there is only ever one 'first' in any sphere and that one does deserve recognition and now with the book, some 50 years after her life ended, Henrietta Lacks has it. Good on yer, Rebecca Skloot, you've done a good thing here."

“She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?”
I've moved this book on and off my TBR for years. The truth is that, with few exceptions, I'm generally turned off by the thought of non-fiction. I'm a fan of fictional stories, and I think I've always felt that non-fiction will be dry, boring and difficult to get through. Especially a book about science, cells and medicine when I'm more of a humanities/social sciences kinda girl.But this book... it's just so interesting. It's written in a very easy, journalistic style and places the author into the story (some people didn't like this, but I thought it felt like you were going along for the journey). It's all the interesting bits of science, full of eye-opening and shocking discoveries, but it's also about history, sociology and race.I started reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks while sat next to my boyfriend. Every so often I would unknowingly gasp or mutter ""oh my god"" and he was like ""what? what?"" and I hadn't even realized I'd done it out loud. It's just full of surprises - and every one is true! It uncovers things you almost certainly didn't know about. And it just shows that sometimes real life can be nastier, more shocking, and more wondrous than anything you could imagine.Maybe you've heard of HeLa in passing, maybe you don't know anything about these cells that helped in cancer research, in finding a polio vaccine, in cloning, in gene mapping and discovering the effects of an atom bomb; either way, this tells an incredible and awful story of a poor, black woman in the American South who was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She is given back her humanity, becoming more than a cluster of cells and being shown for the tough, spirited woman she was. From her own family life to the frankly nauseating treatment of black patients in the 1950s, her story emerges.Not only that, but this book is about the injustices committed by the pharmaceutical industry - both in this individual case (how is it that Henrietta's family are dirt poor when she has revolutionized medicine?) and on a larger scale (during the 1950s, many prisoners were injected with cancer as part of medical experiments!). It's hard to believe what so-called ""professionals"" have gotten away with throughout history - things that we generally associate with Nazi death camps.I honestly could not put it down. Maybe because it's not just about science and cells, but is mainly about all of the humanity and social history behind scientific discoveries. Maybe because Skloot is so damn passionate about her subject and that passion is transferred to the reader. Whatever the reason, I highly recommend it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"
123,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"This was a really good book that leaves one with more questions than it answers, especially at this moment with the explosion in investment and growth in health/biotech. A lot of those questions are ones I wouldn't know how to answer myself either. I think it's really important though that we all start grappling with and instituting better processes around things like informed consent. Also really horrible to think about this in larger societal terms, in the context of institutional racism, and the ways in which the Lacks family still is so socioeconomically disadvantaged while private biotechnology companies sell their mother's cells for so much money. I just feel so extremely uncomfortable with that. I think I wouldn't care so much if the cells were just part of the commons, available for free, or extremely cheaply, but to know people are profiting off of it, it really is quite disgusting. I try not to bring my politics to bear here quite too often but this really really makes me feel strongly that commercialization of things in biological research, especially people's biological matter and tissue shouldn't be happening. This whole situation just feels quite perverse honestly and the book left me feeling disheartened. The dual dehumanization of the Lacks family through science and commercialization is horrifying. And I think if we wants things to be better moving forward both need to be addressed, not just one."
124,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"On October 4, 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a thirty-one-year old black woman, died after a gruesome battle with a rapidly metastasizing cancer. During her treatment, the doctors at Johns Hopkins took some cells from her failing body and used them for research. This was not an unusual thing to have done in 1951. But the cells that came from Ms. Lacks’ body were unusual. They had qualities that made them uniquely valuable as research tools. Labeled “HeLa”, Henrietta’s cells were reproduced by the billions over the following sixty years and have been instrumental in experiments across a wide range of biological science. Today, HeLa cells are sold by the vial at impressive prices. Yet, Ms. Lacks’ family has seen not a penny of compensation from the work that has been made possible by their relative’s unique cells. Rebecca Skloot - from Powell'sRebecca Skloot, a science writer with articles published in many major outlets, spent years looking into the genesis of these cells. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells four stories. First is the tale of HeLa cells, and the value they have been to science; second is the life of, arguably, the most important cell “donor” in history, and of her family; third is a look at the ethics of cell “donation” and the commercial and legal significance of rights involved; and fourth is the Visible Woman look at Skloot’s pursuit of the tales. Each story is significant. The contribution of HeLa cells has been huge and it is important to know how these cells came to be so widely used, and what are the characteristics that make them so valuable. Skloot goes into a reasonable level of detail for those of us who do not make our living in a lab coat. She adds information on how cell cultures can become contaminated, and how that impacts completed research. She also offers a description of telomeres, strings of DNA at the end of chromosomes critical to longevity, and key to the immortality of HeLa cells. Fascinating stuff. Henrietta Lacks - From Science And FilmSkloot constructs a biography of Henrietta, and patches together a portrait of the life of her family, from her ancestors to her children, siblings and other relations. It is with a source of pride, among other emotions, that her family regards Henrietta’s impact on the world. Skloot delves into these feelings, and the experiences the Lacks family members have had over the decades with people trying to write about Henrietta, and people trying to exploit their interest in Henrietta for dark purposes.The author had to overcome considerable family resistance before she was able to get them to meet with and ultimately open up to her. She takes us through her process, showing who she talked with, when, and the result of those conversations, what institutions she contacted re locating and gaining access to information about Henrietta and some other family members. Most interesting, and at times frustrating, is her story of how she gained the trust of some, if not all, of the Lacks family. This is like presenting a how-to of her research process, a blow-by-blow description of the way research is done in the real world, and it is very enlightening.The Immortal Tale of Henrietta Lacks has received considerable acclaim. It is all well-deserved. The book is an eye-opening window into a piece of our history that is mostly unknown. It presents science in a very manageable way and gives us plenty to think about the next time we have a blood test or any other medical procedure. This book may not be as immortal as Henrietta’s cells, but it will stay with you for a very long time.The HBO Film airs on April 22, 2017==============================EXTRA STUFF8/8/13 - NY Times article - A Family Consents to a Medical Gift, 62 Years Later3/29/17 - Washington Post - On the eve of an Oprah movie about Henrietta Lacks, an ugly feud consumes the family - by Steve Hendrix"

126,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2085746-laura,3,"Fascinating and Thought-Provoking.
Strengths:
*Fantastically interesting subject!One woman's cancerous cells are multiplied and distributed around the globe enabling a new era of cellular research and fueling incredible advances in scientific methodology, technology, and medical treatments. This strain of cells, named HeLa (after Henrietta Lacks their originator), has been amazingly prolific and has become integrated into advancements of science around the world (space travel, genome research, pharmaceutical treatments, polio vaccination, etc). *Thought-Provoking Ethical Questions This book makes you ponder ethical questions historically raised by the unfolding sequence of events and still rippling currently. Ex. 1) Informed consent: Henrietta did not provide informed consent (not required in those days). Ex. 2) Genetic rights/non-rights: her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later. Ex. 3) Patents and profits for biologic material: zero profits realized by Henrietta or her descendants; multiple-millions in profits have been realized by individuals and corporations utilizing her genetic material.*Biographical description of Henrietta and interviews with her family.  The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications. We're reading about actual, valuable people and historic events.
Weaknesses:
*Framework: the book is framed around the author's journey of writing the story and her interactions with Henrietta's family. I thought the author got in the way and would have preferred to have to read less of her journey and more coverage of the science involved and its ethical implications. I found myself distinctly not caring how many times the author circled the block or how many trips she made to Henrietta's birthplace.*Lack of Clarity: By mid-point through the book, I was wishing the biographical approach was more refined and focused. The narrative swerved through the author's interest in various people as she encountered them along the way: Henrietta, Henrietta's immediate family, scientists, Henrietta's extended family, a neighborhood grocery store owner, a con artist, Henrietta's youngest daughter, Henrietta's oldest daughter, etc. Everything was a side dish; no particular biography satisfied as a main course.
Bottom Line:
This book won't join my 'to re-read' shelf...but has whetted my appetite for further exploration of this important woman, fascinating topic and intriguing ethical questions.I was left wanting more:-more detail surrounding the science involved, -more coverage of past and present ethical implications-a more refined biography of Henrietta, and -a more focused look at the impact and implications of the HeLa cell strain line on Henrietta's descendants."

A young black mother dies of cervical cancer in 1950 and unbeknownst to her becomes the impetus for many medical advances through the decades that follow because of the cancer cells that were taken without her permission. This book evokes so many thoughts and feelings, sometimes at odds with one another. It is thought provoking and informative in the details and heartbreaking in the rendering of the personal story of Henrietta Lacks. I was madder than hell that people/companies made loads of money on the Hela cell line while some members of the Lacks family didn’t have health insurance . Yet, I am grateful for the research advances that made a polio vaccine possible, advanced cancer research and genetics, and so much more.Rebecca Skloot does a wonderful job of presenting the moral and legal questions of medical research without consent meshing this with the the human side giving a picture of the woman whose cells saved so many lives. We get to know her family, especially her daughter Deborah who worked tirelessly with the author to discover what happened to her mother. This made it all so real - not just a recitation of the facts. The scientific aspects are very detailed but understandable. It was the sections on Henrietta and her family that I wanted to read the most.In 1950 there was “no formal research oversight in the United States.” Years later there are laws on “informed consent “ and how medical research is conducted, and protection of privacy for medical records. Yet even today, there are controversies over the ownership of human tissue. The in depth research over years in writing this book is evident and I believe a heartfelt effort to recognize Henrietta Lacks for her unwitting contribution to medical research."
128,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114573-chelsea,3,"This could have been an incredible book. Henrietta Lacks' story is finally told--and Skloot makes very clear how important Lacks' cells have been to the last 60 years of science and, paradoxically, how much Henrietta and her family suffered because those cells were taken from Henrietta without her consent. But in her effort to contrast the importance and profitability of Henrietta's cells with the marginalization and impoverishment of Henrietta's family, Skloot makes three really big mistakes. First, she's not transparent about her own journalistic ethics, which is troubling in a book about ethics. Did the Lacks family end up benefiting from her book financially? Did all Lacks give permission for their depictions in the book? We never know. Second, Skloot's narration when describing the Lacks family suffering--sexual abuse, addiction, disability, mental illness--lacks sensitivity; it often feels clinical and sometimes even voyeuristic. Again, this is disturbing in a book that concerns the importance of dignity, consent, etc.Finally, Skloot inserts herself into the story over and over, not so subtly suggesting that she is a hero for telling Henrietta's story. Sometimes, it appears that she is making the very offensive suggestion that she, a highly educated unreligious white woman, has healed the Lacks family by showing them science and history."
129,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731872-kathleen,3,"My thoughts on this book are kind of all over the place. I feel for the Lacks family, I really do. It's hard to read about the poverty and lack of education and the cavalier approach towards informed consent in the early days of Johns Hopkins Research Hospital. The fact that the HeLa cell line is the foundation of so much valuable research is rightfully a source of pride for the family of Henrietta Lacks. I don't think they will ever see monetary compensation for their mother's cancer cell line, however. That horse left the barn a long, long time ago.Furthermore, I don't feel the admiration for the author of this book like I think many others do. She wanted to make herself out to be different than all the rest of the people who wrote about the woman behind the HeLa cell line but I only saw the similarities. Yes, she has established a scholarship fund for the descendants of Henrietta Lacks but I got tired of hearing again and again how she financed her research herself. I think the exploitation is there, just prettied up a bit with a lot of self-congratulatory descriptions of how HARD she had to try to talk to the family and how MANY times she called asking for interviews. At times I felt like she badgered them worse than the unethical people who had come before.The sadness of this story is really about the devastation of a family when its unifying force, a strong mother, is removed. Piled on with more sadness about the appalling institutional conditions for mentally handicapped patients (talking about Henrietta Lacks' oldest daughter) back in the 50's and you have tragedy on top of more tragedy."
130,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,4,"This is a very powerful and informative story. Also, with the history of personal freedoms, civil rights, and right to privacy/requiring consent, this is a very important books. I am not sure the details about the science involved in the story will appeal to all. Just the same as how those who are here for the science may be disinterested in the background stories of the people involved. But, if you think you will like one of the other, I don’t think the one you don’t care for will be distracting.With that in mind, I will continue with the statement that it really is two books: the science and the people. First, the background of cell and tissue research in the last 100 years is intriguing and to hear about all of the advances and why Henretta Lacks was key to them is fascinating. Second, the background of not only the Lacks family, but also others who have had their tissues/cells used for research without permission, gives a lot of food for thought. Almost every medical advancement, and many scientific advancements, in the past 60 years are because of Henrietta Lacks. But, questions about the consent she gave, what she understood about her cells being used, and how much the family has benefited are all questioned and discussed. It really hits hard to think that you may have no control over parts of you once they are no longer part of your body. Also, the fiscal and research ramifications of giving people more rights over their body tissue/cells really creates a huge Catch-22. As I had surgery earlier this year that involved some tissue being removed for analysis, it started to make me wonder what I signed on all those forms and if my cells might still be out there being used for research.The only part of the book that kind of dragged for me was the time that the author spent with the family late in the book. After listening to an interview with the author it was surprising to hear that this part of the book may have been her original focus (how the family has dealt with the revelations surrounding the use of their mother’s cells), but to me it kind of dragged and got repetitive. I don’t think it is bad and others may find it interesting, it just was what brought down my interest in the story a little bit.If you like science-based stories, medical-based stories, civil/personal rights history, and/or just love a decent non-fiction, I think this book is very worth checking out."
131,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1992225-liz-nutting,5,"When I was a graduate student in the field of Ethics, one of my favorite pedagogical strategies, as both a teacher and a student, was the case study. A good case study can make an abstract ethical issue more concrete. A really good case study can turn a deeply contentious issue into an opportunity for thoughtfulness and compassion; right and wrong (to the extent that those concepts even belong in the study of ethics) are nuanced by descriptions of circumstances or values or human need that can make it easier to see and hear and believe the ones on the other side(s) of an issue. Often the case studies are hypothetical, or descriptions of actual cases pared to ""just the facts, ma'am,"" without all the possible extenuating circumstances that can shape difficult decisions. For some students, this causes great angst. How could they be asked to make a judgment, especially one that might involve life or death, without knowing all the details? And of course, at the end of the lesson, everyone wants to know what really happened, how things turned out ""in real life."" On those rare occasions when we actually do know something of the outcome, it is clear that knowing what ""really"" happened almost never makes the decision easier, clearer, or less agonizing. And that is what makes The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks so deeply compelling and challenging. It is the rare story of the outcome of a seemingly inconsequential decision by a doctor and a researcher in 1951, one that few at that time would have ever seen as an ethical decision, let alone an unethical one. A researcher studying cell cultures needs samples; a doctor treating a woman with aggressive cervical cancer scrapes a few extra cells of that cancer into a Petri dish for the researcher. The missing cells had no bearing whatsoever on the outcome of the woman's disease, so no harm done. A few weeks later the woman is dead, but her cancer cells are living in the lab. The bare bones ethical issue at stake--whether it is ethically warranted to take a patient's tissues without consent and subsequently use them for scientific and medical research--is even now not a particularly contentious one...yet. Legally, the case law is settled: tissue removed in the course of medical treatment or testing no longer belongs to the patient. It is, in essence, refuse, and one woman's trash is another man's treasure. Ethically, almost all the professional guidelines encourage researchers to obtain consent, but they have no teeth (and most were non-existent in 1951 anyway). In reality, the vast majority of the tissue taken from patients is of limited use. But there are those rare times when a single person's cells have the potential to break open the worlds of science and medicine, to the benefit of millions--and the enrichment of a very few. Such was the case with the cells of cervical cancer taken from Henrietta Lacks at Johns Hopkins University hospital. HeLa cells grew in the lab of George Gey. And grew. And grew, unlike any cell before it. Next, they were carried to a different laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, where Jonas Salk used them to successfully test his polio vaccine, and thus the cancer that had killed Henrietta Lacks directly led to the healing of millions worldwide. Soon HeLa cells would be in almost every major research laboratory in the world. They traveled to Asia to help find a cure for hemorrhagic fever and into space to study the effects of zero gravity on human cells. Even today, almost 60 years after Henrietta's death, HeLa cells are some of the most widely used by the scientific community. With such immeasurable benefits as these, who could possibly doubt the wisdom of Henrietta's doctor to take a tiny bit of tissue? But the ""real"" story is much more complicated. Henrietta Lacks was uneducated, poor and black. Her cancer was treated in the ""colored"" ward of Johns Hopkins. Her death left five children without their mother, to be raised by an abusive cousin. Should any of that matter in weighing the morality of taking tissue from a patient without her consent, especially in light of the benefits? God knows our country's history of medical experimentation on the poor and minority populations is not pretty. Ironically, one of the laboratories researching with HeLa cells in the 1950s was the one at the Tuskegee Institute--at the very same time that the infamous syphilis studies were taking place. In light of that history, Henrietta's race and socioeconomic status can't help but be relevant factors in her particular case. But her children's status? What bearing does that have? According to author Rebecca Skloot, in ethical discussions of the use of human tissue, ""[t]here are, essentially, two issues to deal with: consent and money."" Both become issues for Henrietta's children. The family didn't learn until 1973 that their mother's cells had been taken, or that they'd played such a vital role in the development of scientific knowledge. They spent the next 30 years trying to learn more about their mother's cells. As they learned of the money made by the pharmaceutical companies and other companies as a direct result of HeLa cells, they inevitably asked questions about what share, if any, they were entitled to. As Henrietta's eldest son put it, ""If our mother so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?"" But even more than financial compensation, the family wants recognition--and respect--for their mother. They want the woman behind her contributions acknowledged for who she is--a black woman, a mother, a person with name longer than four letters. And they want to know the mother they never knew, to find out the facts of her death. In the lab at Johns Hopkins, looking through a microscope at her mother's cells for the first time, daughter Deborah sums it up: ""John Hopkin [sic] is a school for learning, and that's important. But this is my mother. Nobody seem to get that."" Would a fully informed Henrietta Lacks have made the decision to give her tissue to George Gey if asked? Would her decision either way have had any affect whatsoever on her children's future lives? We'll never know, of course. But reading the story behind the case study makes these questions far more potent than any ethics textbook can. And as science now unravels the strains of our DNA--thanks in no small part to HeLa--these are no longer inconsequential questions for any of us. Perhaps we, too, like the doctors and scientists who have long studied HeLa, can learn from the case study of Henrietta Lacks. "
132,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-bionic-jean,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is is an extraordinary book. By turns it is shocking, informative and tragic. There is brilliance - but also deep injustice. It is in part an account of the development of genetics, part social commentary, and partly the story of one woman, Henrietta Lacks. She was an African-American woman descended from slaves and one white slave-owner (Lacks), and she lived as many hundreds of black people still did even as late as the 1950's, in poverty in an old slave-cabin - the ""home-house"" - in East Baltimore. And although the events do not always make for easy reading, the author assures us that it is completely non-fiction. Nothing has been invented, nothing exaggerated. The author has done her level best to tell things as they were. Although the name ""Henrietta Lacks"" is comparatively unknown, ""HeLa"" cells are routinely used in scientific experiments worldwide today, and have been for decades. They are the only human cells thought to be scientifically ""immortal"" ie if they are provided with the correct culture and environment they do not die. They were cut from a tumour in the cervix of Henrietta Lacks a few months before she died in 1951; extracted because she had a particular virulent form of cancer. Despite extreme measures taken in the laboratories to protect the cells, human cells had always inevitably died after a few days. HeLa cells though, stayed alive in the petri dish, and proved to be virtually unstoppable, growing faster and stronger than any other cells known.These HeLa cells were used to develop the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilisation and a host of other medical treatments. They were sent on the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity. It is fair to say that they have helped with some of the most important advances in medicine. But there is a terrible irony and injustice in this. The people to benefit from this were largely white people. Henrietta Lacks's family and descendants suffered appalling poverty. Working from dawn to dusk in poisonous tobacco fields was the norm as soon as the children were able to stand. Moving from Virginia's tobacco production to Bethlehem Steel, a boiler manufacturer in South Boston, was little better, as they were then exposed to asbestos and coal. The families had intermingled for generations. Henrietta and Day, her husband, were first cousins, and this was by no means unusual. So the predisposition to illness was both hereditary and environmental. But access to medical help was virtually nil. Most hospitals accepted only whites, or grudgingly admitted so-called ""colored"" people to a separate area, which was far less well funded and staffed. The Lacks family had to travel a long way in order to be treated, and then were not allowed the privilege of proper explanations as to the treatment given - or the tissue samples extracted.At this time unusual cells were taken routinely by doctors wanting to make their own investigations into cancer (which at that time was thought to be a virus) and many other conditions. No permission was sought; none was needed. The Hippocratic oath doctors set such store by dates from the 4th Century BC, and makes no mention of it; neither did the law of the time require it. It was not until 1947, that the subject was raised. Nazi doctors had performed many ethically unsound operations and experiments on live Jews, and during the trials after the war the Nuremberg Code - a 10 point code of ethics - was set up. This states that, ""The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential."" Even then it was advice, not law. Rebecca Skloot says that Howard Jones, the doctor who had originally diagnosed Henrietta Lacks' cancer, said, ""Hopkins, with its large indigent black population, had no dearth of clinical material."" It was clearly a racial norm of the time. In fact to be fair, the white doctors had no real conception that what they were doing had an ethical side. George Gey and his assistants were responsible for isolating the genetic material in Henrietta's cells - an astonishing feat. Gey happily shared the cells with any scientists who asked. The issue of payment was never raised, but the HeLa cells fast became a commodity, and the Lacks's family, who were never consulted about anything, mistakenly assumed until very recently that Gey must have made a fortune out of them. As Henrietta's daughter Deborah said, ""Them white folks getting rich of our mother while we got nothin."" Skloot carefully chronicles some of the most shocking medical stories from these times. The reader infers from her examples that testing on the impoverished and disadvantaged was almost routine. One notorious study was into syphilis and apparently went on for 40 years. It was called the ""Tuskegee study"", and involved thousands of males at varying stages of the disease. At the time it was known that they could be cured by penicillin, but they were not given this treatment, in order that doctors could study the progress of the disease. In this case they were volunteers, but were encouraged by the offer of free travel to the hospital, a free meal when they got there, and the promise of $50 for their families after they died, for funeral expenses. There are many such poignant examples. The author also says that in 1954 thousands of chronically ill elderly people, convicts and even some children, were injected by a Dr. Chester Southam with HeLa cells, basically just to see what would happen. Of course many of them went on to develop cancer. One man who had Hela cells injected in his arm produced small tumours there within days. But the patients were never informed of this, and if they did happen to ask were told they were being ""tested for immunity"". (We are told that Southam was prosecuted for this much later in 1966.) It was not until 1957 that there was any mention in law of ""informed consent."" Confidentially and privacy violation issues came far later.After her death, four of Henrietta Lacks's children, Lawrence, Deborah, Sonny and Joe, were put in the charge of Ethel, a friend of the family who had been very envious of Henrietta. It appears that she was incredibly cruel to the children, hardly ever feeding them until late, after a day's work, when they would be given a meagre crust. She would also drag the youngest one, Joe, out of bed at will, and beat him unmercifully. Joe was only 4 months old when his mother died and grew up to have severe behavioural problems. In fact later on on life, all these children grew to have not only health problems (including all being almost deaf) but a myriad of social problems too - being involved in burglary, assault and drugs - and spent a lot of their lives in prison.One of Henrietta's five children had been put in ""Crownsville Hospital for the Negro Insane"" when she was still tiny, because Henrietta was too ill to care for her any more. The story of this child, which is gradually told through Skloot's text as more of it is revealed, is heart-breaking. It is not clear why Elsie was so slow, but her mental retardation is now thought to be partly due to syphilis, and partly due to being born on the home-house stone floor - which was routine for such families at the time - and banging her head during birth. It was not known what had subsequently happened to Elsie until Skloot's research, but then some records were discovered. A photograph of Elsie shows a miserable child apparently in pain in a distorted position. Apparently brain scans then necessitated draining the surrounding brain fluid. Never mind that the patient might then suffer violent headaches, fits and vomiting for 2-3 months until the fluid reformed; it gave a better picture. Many people had been sent to this institution because of ""idiocy"" or epilepsy; the assumption now is that that they were incarcerated to get them out of the way, and that tests like this, often for research, were routine. Figures from 1955, when Elsie died, showed that at that time the hospital had 2700 patients, which was 800 over the maximum capacity. The ratio of doctors to patients was 1 doctor for 225 patients.Add into this the appalling inhumanity of history where white people used black people for their own ends, and the fears of Henrietta's family and community become inevitable. There had been stories for generations of white-coated doctors coming at dead of night and experimenting on black people. This became confused - or perhaps vindicated - by the Ku Klux Klan. Stories of voodoo, charismatic religious experiences, dire poverty, lack of basic education (one of Henrietta's brothers was more fortunate in that he had 4 years' schooling in total) untreated health problems and the prevailing 1950's attitudes of never questioning the doctor, all fed into the mix resulting in ignorance and occasional hysteria.Much of the first part of this book includes descriptions of scientific research and discoveries; both the theory and practise of how genes were isolated. Alternating with this is the background to the racial tensions, and the history of Henrietta Lacks' ancestry and family. Rebecca Skloot, a science writer, had been fascinated by the potential story since school days, when she first heard of HeLa cells, but nobody seemed to know anything about them. She started this book in her 20's, and spent a decade researching it, financed by credit cards and student loans. As a white woman she was treated with gross suspicion by all Henrietta Lacks's family. Eventually she formed a good relationship with Deborah, but it took a year before Deborah would even speak to her, and Deborah's brothers were very resistant. Several of them were pastors, as was James Pullam, her husband. They believed the Bible literally and had many fears about how Henrietta's cells were used. Deborah herself could not understand how they were immortal. Could her mother's cells feel pain when they were exploded, or infected? Would they develop into half-human half-chicken freaks when they were split and combined with chicken cells? Were there millions of clones all looking like her mother wandering around London? The media worldwide had played its part in adding to these fears, which had been spawned by a genuine ignorance.The interviews with Henrietta's family, and the progress and discoveries Skloot made accompanied by Deborah in the second part of the book, do make the reader uneasy. Indeed parts of these passages read like a trashy novel. Skloot says she wanted to report the conversation verbatim, so the vernacular is reported intact. Fair enough. But there is a lot of, ""Deborah shouted"" or, ""Lawrence yelled"". Of course they did! All of Henrietta's children had severe health problems, probably due to a variety of factors; their environment, upbringing and genetic inheritance. They were all very hard of hearing, so yes, they would shout when amongst themselves. Add to this Skloot's tendency to describe the attributes and appearance of a family member as ""beautiful hazel-nut brown skin"" or ""twinkling eyes"" and there is a whiff of condescension which does not sit well. Does it add anything to this account? Would a description of the author as having ""raven-black hair and full glossy lips"" help? Of course not. The author may feel she is being complimentary; she is not. She is being patronising. But it is difficult to know how else the total incomprehension and ignorance of how a largely white society operated could have been conveyed, other than by this verbatim reportage, even though at worst it comes across as extremely crass, and at best gently humorous.It would be convenient to imagine that these appalling cases were a thing of the past. But the book continues detailing injustices until the date of its publication in 2010. Henrietta's son, Sonny had a quintuple bypass in 2003. Skloot reports, ""The last thing he remembered before falling unconscious under the anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened in medicine."" So far, so good. There was recognition. But Skloot then delivers the final shot, ""Sonny woke up more than $125,500 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery."" As Lawrence (Henrietta's eldest son) says elsewhere, ""It's not fair! She's the most important person in the world and her family [are] living in poverty. If our mother [is] so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""Henrietta's original cancer had in fact been misdiagnosed. It was discovered years later that because she had syphilis, she had the genital warts HPV virus, which does actually invade the DNA. There is an intriguing section on this, as well as the ""HeLa bomb"", where one doctor painstakingly proved to the whole of the scientific community that a lot of their research had been flawed, as HeLa cells were contaminating many of the other cells they had been working with and drawing conclusions from. They were so virulent that they could travel on the smallest particle of dust in the atmosphere, and because Gey had given them so generously, there was no real record of where they had all ended up.Deborah herself always lived in fear of inheriting her mother's cancer. Because of this she readily submitted to tests. Victor McKusick took blood samples, which Deborah believed were for ""cancer tests."" In fact though, Skloot claims, they were for his own research. This is another example of chronic misunderstanding. He knew of the family's mental anguish and the unfair treatment they had had. He thought she understood why he wanted the blood. He gave her an autographed copy of his book - a technical manual on Genetics. Of this, Deborah commented wryly, ""It would have been nice if he'd told me what the damn thing said too."" And again, ""I would like some health insurance so I don't got to pay all that money every month for drugs my mother cells probably helped to make.""In 2001, Skloot tells us, Christoph Lengauer, now the Head of Oncology in one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, said of Henrietta, ""Her cells are how it all started."" And to Deborah, ""Once there is a cure for cancer, it's definitely largely because of your mother's cells.""In 2005 the US government issued gene patents relating to the use of 20% of known human genes, including Alzheimer's, asthma, colon cancer and breast cancer. The injustices however, continue. Pharmaceutical companies, scientists and universities now control what research is done, and the costs of the resulting tests and therapies. An example of how this continues to impede scientific development according to the author is that of the company Myriad Genetics, who hold the patent on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. (These are the genes which are responsible for most hereditary breast cancers.) The company had arbitrarily set a charge of $3000 to have this test, amid furore amongst scientists. They had licensed the use of the test. Anyone who ignored it received a threat of litigation. Eventually in 2009 they were sued by the American Civil Liberties Union, representing a huge number of people including 150,000 scientists for inhibiting research. The commercialisation of human biological materials has now become big business.There seems to have been some attempts at restitution since this book was published, the most recent being in August 2013. There was an agreement between the family and The National Institutes of Health to give the family some control over the access to the cells' DNA code, and a promise of acknowledgement on scientific papers. The committee set to oversee this arrangement will have 6 members, 2 of whom will be members of the family. The wheels have been set in motion.All in all this is an important and startlingly original book by a dedicated and compassionate author. It speaks to every one of us, regardless of our colour, nationality or class. Skloot admitted that it took a long time to decide the structure of the book, in order to include all the important aspects that she wished to. There are three sections: ""Life"", ""Death"" and ""Immortality"", plus an ""Afterword"". The main thrust throughout is clearly the enduring injustice the Lacks family suffered. So perhaps the final words should be Joe's, or (as he changed his name when he converted to Islam in prison), Zakariyya's: ""I believe what them doctors did was wrong. They lied to us for 25 years, kept them cells from us, then they gonna say them things DONATED by our mother. Them cells was stolen! Those fools come take blood from us sayin they need to run tests and not tell us that all these years they done profitized off of her…. You don't lie and clone behind their backs. That's wrong - it's one of the most violating parts of this whole thing….Then doctors say her cells [are] so important and did all this and that to help people. But it didn't do no good for her, and it don't do no good for us. If me and my sister need something, we can't even go and see a doctor cause we can't afford it.""It's too late for some of Henrietta's family. For how many others will it also be too late?"

Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, ""Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."" (Matthew 26:26-28, NIV Bible)From The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks: There's no way of knowing how many of Henrietta's cells are alive today. One scientist estimates that if you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown on a scale, they'd weigh more than 50 million metric tons--an inconceivable number, given that an individual cell weighs almost nothing....Her cells were part of research into the genes that cause cancer and those that suppress it; they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, and Parkinson's disease; and they've been used to study lactose digestion, sexually transmitted diseases, appendicitis, human longevity, mosquito mating, and the negative cellular effects of working in sewers....Like guinea pigs and mice, Henrietta's cells have become the standard laboratory workhorse.(The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, pp. 2-4)Questions:1) Assuming Jesus Christ was speaking literally, please calculate the total mass and volume of the Body of Christ consumed in the period between the Last Supper (c. 30-36 AD/CE) and the present day.

But what happens when her biological material generates billions of dollars for the drug and pharmaceutical industry, leaving her dirt poor descendants in the lurch?Yeah, I know I wrote that like the teaser for one of my mysteries but the only mystery here is how people who have profited from the diseased cells that killed a woman can sleep at night while her kids and grand kids don't have two nickels to rub together.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is really two stories. One of Henrietta Lacks and her cancer cells that lived decades beyond her years, and the other of Rebecca Skloot and the surviving members of the Lacks family.Henrietta Lacks married her counsin, contracted multiple STD's due to his philandering ways, and died of misdiagnosed cervical cancer by the time she was 30. However, the cancer that killed her survives today in the form of HeLa cells, which have been taken to the moon, exposed to every manner of radiation and illness, and all sorts of other experiments. While other people are raking in money due to the HeLa research, the surviving Lacks family doesn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of, bringing me to the real meat of the book: The pharmaceutical industry is a bunch of dickbags. Imagine having something removed that generated billions of dollars of revenue for people you've never met and still needing to watch your budget so you can pay your mortage. Fair? Shit no, but that's the way it is, apparently. It also seems illogical that you can patent things you didn't create but again, that's the way the cookie crumbles.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an eye-opening look at someone most of us have never heard of but probably owe some sort of debt to. Also, it drags the big money pharma companies out in the sun. Sadly, they do not burst into flames like the vampires they are. Four out of five stars. I'm going to go read something happy now."
135,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,5,"The gift of life is surely the greatest gift of all. So how can the story of the remarkable woman who gave that gift over and over again to millions of people have been overlooked for so long?In 1951 a poor African American woman in Maryland became an uninformed donor to medical science. Henrietta Lacks died at age 31 of cervical cancer at John Hopkins hospital in Baltimore. Then doctors discovered that tumor cells they had removed from her body earlier continued to thrive in the lab - a medical first.Before long, her cells, dubbed HeLa cells, would be used for research around the world, contributing to major advances in everything from cancer treatments to vaccines; from aging to the life cycle of mosquitoes; nuclear bomb explosions to effect of gravity on human tissue during flights to outer space. An estimated 50 million metric tons of her cells were reproduced; thousands of careers have been build, and initiated more than 60 000 scientific studies until now, but Henrietta Lacks never gave permission for that research, nor had her family.In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca Skloot gracefully tells the story of the real woman and her descendants; the history of race-related medical research, including the role of eugenics; the struggles of the Lacks family with poverty, politics and racial issues; the phenomenal development of science based on the HeLa cells, in a language that can be understood by everyone. She combined the family's story with the changing ethics and laws around tissue collection, the irresponsible use of the family's medical information by journalists and researchers and the legislation preventing the family from benefiting from it all.COMMENTSI was gifted this book in December but never realized the impact it had internationally, neither would have on me. Until I finished reading it last night, I did not know it was an international bestseller, as well as read by so many of my GR friends! It was total surprise, since nonfiction is normally not a regular star on bestseller lists, right?The debate around the moral issue, and the experiences of the poor family were very well presented in the book, which was truly well written and objective as far as possible. For me personally, the question of how this woman, who basically saved millions of people's lives, were overlooked, is answered in the arrogance of scientists who deemed it unnecessary to respect the rights of people unable to fend for themselves.The ethical and moral dilemmas it created in America, when the family became aware of their mother's contribution to science without anyone's knowledge or consent, just enabled the commercial enterprises who benefited massively from her cells, to move to other countries where human rights are just a faint star in a unlimited universe. The Lacks family drew a line in the sand of how far people must be exploited in America. Unfortunately the medical fraternity just moved their operations elsewhere.Tissue and organ harvesting thrive in the world, it is globally a massive industry, with the poorest of the poor still the uninformed donors. An open secret. There are numerous stories, especially in India, where people wake up and realize they were operated on and one of their organs is missing. Stolen. By the time they became aware of it, the organ had already been transplanted in America and elsewhere in the world. That's no secret. Everything is justified as long as science is involved.  Nowadays people in other parts of the world sell their organs, even though it is illegal in most countries. According to American laws people cannot sell their tissue, which is part of human organs? People can donate it though, then it is acceptable.Yet someone else can patent your cells, but you're not allowed to be compensated, since the minute it leaves your body, it is regarded as waste, disposed of, and therefor not deemed your 'property' anymore. Huh?This book was a good and necessary read. The human interest side of it, telling the story of the family was eye-opening and excellent. A little bit of melodramatic, but how else would it become a bestseller, if ordinary readers like us could not relate to it. It was very well-written indeed. Thanks to Rebecca Skloot, in 2010, sixty years later, HeLa now has a history, a face and an address. Finally, Henrietta Lacks, and not the anonymous HeLa, became a biological celebrity. In 1951 Dr. Grey's lab assistant handled yet just another tissue sample of hundreds, when she received Henrietta's to prepare for research. She named it HeLa(first two letters of the patient's name and last name). But a few months later she visited the body of the deceased Henrietta Lacks in the mortuary to collect more samples. When she saw the woman's red-painted toenails, a lightbulb went on.Mary Kubicek: “Oh jeez, she’s a real person. . . . I started imagining her sitting in her bathroom painting those toenails, and it hit me for the first time that those cells we’d been working with all this time and sending all over the world, they came from a live woman. I’d never thought of it that way.”John Hopkins hospital could have considered naming a wing of their research facilities after Henrietta Lack. Why don't they?Nevertheless, this book should be read by everybody. Without it the world would have been a lot poorer and less human.The world has a lot to answer for.RECOMMENDED for sure!EDIT I googled the Lacks family and landed upon the website of the Lacks Foundation, which was started by Rebecca Skloot. http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/That news TOTALLY made my day. I wish them all the best and hope they will succeed in their goals and dreams. A wonderful initiative. Just imagine what can be accomplished if every single person, organization, research facility and medical company who benefitted for Henrietta Lacks's tissue cells, donate only $1 (one single dollar)? Yes, just imagine that!So many positive things happened to the family after the book was published. It just brings tears of joy to my eyes.http://www.lacksfamily.net/index.phpAnd finally: May 29, 2010A Historic Day: Henrietta Lacks’s Long Unmarked Grave Finally Gets a Headstonethanks to Dr. Roland Pattillo at Morehouse School of Medicine, who donated a headstone after reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks."

Or, as is the case hear, having learned so much about which I knew nothing. My jaw is still on the floor after I finished this book and I can only imagine the controversies and discussions it might provoke. A thank you goes out to three Goodreads friends who recommended that I read this book and open an avenue for discussion. Aven, Brenda, and Rae, I hope we can begin a wild and intriguing dialogue, pulling others into the mix as things gain momentum.Who was Henrietta Lacks? What are HeLa cells? These are two of the foundational questions that Rebecca Skloot sought to answer in this poignant biographical piece. While I have tackled a number of biographies in my time as a reader, Skloot offered a unique approach to the genre in publication. Henrietta Lacks grew up in rural Virginia, picking tobacco and made ends meet as best she could. After marrying, she had a brood of children, including two of note, Elsie and Deborah, whose significance becomes apparent as the reader delves deeper into the narrative. Skloot offered up a succinct, but detailed narrative of how Lacks found an unusual mass inside her and was sent from her doctor to a specialist at Johns Hopkins (yes, THAT medical centre) for treatment. The mass was malignant and Lacks was deemed to have cervical cancer. Her surgeon, following the precedent of many doctors in the early 1950s, took samples of her tumour as well as that of the healthy part of her cervix, hoping to be able to have the cells survive so they could be analysed. Past attempts by doctors and scientists failed to keep cells alive for very long, which led to the constant slicing and saving technique used by those in the medical profession, when the opportunity arose. As it turns out, Lacks' cells were not only fascinating to explore, but George Gey (Head of Tissue Culture Research at Johns Hopkins) noticed that they lasted indefinitely, as long as they were properly fed. Gey realised that he had something on his hands and tried to get approval from the Lacks family, though did so in an extremely opaque manner. After Lacks succumbed to the cancer, doctors sought to perform an autopsy, which might allow them complete access to Lacks' body. Ignorant of what was going on, Henrietta's husband agreed, thinking that this was only to ensure his children and subsequent generations would not suffer the agony that cancer brought upon Henrietta. So began the conniving and secretive nature of George Gey. He harvested these 'special cells' and named them ""HeLa"", a brief combination of the original patient's two names. Their phenomenal growth and sustainability led him to ship them all over the country and eventually the world, though the Lacks family had no idea this was going on. HeLa cells were studied to create a polio vaccine (Jonas Salk used them at the University of Pittsburgh), helped to better understand cellular reactions to nuclear testing, space travel, and introduction of cancer cells into an otherwise healthy body during curious and somewhat inhumane tests on Ohio inmates. During all this, Johns Hopkins remained completely aware of what was going on and the transmission of HeLa cells around the globe, though did not think to inform the Lacks family, perhaps for fear that they would halt the use of these HeLa cells. Through the use of the term 'HeLa' cells, no one was the wiser and no direct acknowledgement of the long-deceased Henrietta Lacks need be made. Skloot provided much discussion about the uses, selling, 'donating', and experimenting that took place, including segments of the scientific community in America that were knowingly in violation of the Nuremberg Rules on human experimentation, though they danced their own legal jig to get around it all. The crux of the biography lay on this conundrum, though it would only find its true impact by exploring the lives of those Henrietta Lacks left behind after her death.Skloot took the time to pepper chapters with the history of the Lacks family as they grew up and, eventually, what happened when they were made aware that the HeLa cells existed, over two decades after they were obtained and Henrietta had died. Skloot split this other biographical piece into two parts, which eventually merge into one, documenting her research trips and interviews with the family alongside the presentation of a narrative that explores the fruits of those sit-down interviews. That Skloot tried to remain somewhat neutral is apparent, though through her connection to Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah, there was an obvious bias that developed. Superimposing these two narratives would, hopefully, offer the reader a chance to feel a personal connection to the Lacks family and the struggles they went through. In her discussions of the Lacks family, Skloot pulled no punches and presented the raw truths of criminal activity, abuse, addiction, and poverty alongside happy gatherings and memories of Henrietta. No biographical piece would be complete if it were only window dressing and trying to paint a rosy picture of this maligned family without offering at least a little peek into their daily lives. However, it balanced out and Skloot ended up with what the reader might call a decent introduction to this run of the mill family unit. Their ire at being duped by Johns Hopkins was apparent, alongside the dichotomy that HeLa cells were so popular, yet the family remained in dire poverty in the poor areas of Baltimore.The legal ramifications of HeLa cell usage was discussed at various points in the book, though there was no firm case related to it, at least not one including the Lacks family. One person I know sought to draw parallels between the Lacks situation and that of Carrie Buck, as illustrated wonderfully in Adam Cohen's book, Imbeciles (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...). While the courts surely fell short in codifying ownership of cells and research done on them, the focus of Skloot's book was the social injustice by Johns Hopkins, not the ineptitude of the US Supreme Court, as Cohen showed while presenting Buck v. Bell to the curious audience. While George Gey vowed that he gave away the HeLa cell samples to anyone who wanted them, surely the chain reaction and selling of them in catalogues thereafter allowed someone to line their pockets. Skloot offers up numerous mentions from the family, usually through Deborah, that the Lacks family was not seeking to get rich off of this discovery of immortal cells. While companies were spending millions and profiting billions from the early testing of HeLa cells, no one in the family could afford to see a doctor or purchase the medicines they needed (all of which came about because of tests HeLa cells facilitated!). It is both fascinating and angering to see the system wash their hands of the guilt related to immoral collecting and culturing of these HeLa cells. Skloot did explore the slippery slope of cells and tissue as discarded waste, as well as the need for consent in testing them, something the reader ought to spend some time exploring once the biographical narrative ends. It is sure to confound and confuse even the most well-grounded reader.The latter chapters touched upon the aptly used word from the title ""Immortal"" as it relates to Henrietta Lacks. Be it a biography that placed a story behind the woman, a detailed discussion of how the HeLa cell came into being and how its presence is all over the medical world, or that medical advancements as we know them will allow Henrietta Lacks' being to live on for eternity, the reader can reflect on which rationale best suits them. While there is a religious undertone in the biography as it relates to this, Christianity is not inculcated into the reader's mind, as it was not when Skloot learned about these things.Do I know Henrietta Lacks any better now, after Skloot completed her work? Most definitely! Can I, a complete scientific dunce, better understand HeLa cells and the idea behind cell growth and development? Completely! Do I feel there was an injustice done to the Lacks family by Johns Hopkins in 1951 and for decades to come? Yes, I do harbour a strong resentment to the duplicitous attitude undertaken by a hospital whose founder sought to ensure those who could not receive medical care on their own be helped and protected. Is there a lingering legal argument to be made for compensatory damages or at least some fiduciary responsibility owed to the Lacks family? That is a very grey area for me, only further complicated by the legal discussions in the Afterward and the advancement of new and complicated scientific discoveries, which also bore convoluted legal arguments. I will say this... Skloot brought Henrietta Lacks to life and if that puts a face to those HeLa cells, perhaps all those who read this book will think twice about those medicines used in their bodies and the scientific breakthroughs that are attributed to many powerful companies and/or nations. Maybe then, Henrietta can live on in all of us, immortal in some form or another.Kudos, Madam Skloot for intriguing someone whose scientific background is almost nil. You brought numerous stories to life and helped me see just how powerful one woman can be, silenced by death and the ignorance of what those around her were doing.Like/hate the review?

137,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol,4,"This 2010 work of non-fiction regarding THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS is a sad story and a tough, draining read that shocked me more than once along the way.Henrietta was a poor black woman only 31 years of age when she died of cervical cancer leaving five children behind, her youngest, Deborah, just a baby. Her story is a heartbreaking one, but also an important one as her cancer cells, forever to be known as HeLa taken without her consent or knowledge, saved thousands of lives.Through ten long years of investigative work by this author, this narrative explores the experimental, racial and ethical issues of HeLa (the cells that would not die), while intertwining the story of her children's lives and the utter shock of finding out about their mother's cells more than twenty years later.""Physician Seeks Volunteers For Cancer Research."" Yeah, right........So many parts of this book made me sick to my stomach.....like the uncaring treatment of animals and all the poor souls injected with cancer cells without their knowledge in the name of research and greed; and oh, dam Ethel for the inhumane and brutal abuse to Henrietta's children too. Unbelievable!Whew! I must admit to being glad when I turned the last page on this one, but big time kudos to Rebecca Skloot for researching and telling Henrietta's story. She deserved so much better."
138,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,4,"Overall, a four star read that should probably be required reading for both biology and American history classes. (Actually, it was a far more interesting read than that makes it sound). While I had heard a great deal of buzz on the book, I wasn't prepared for how the story evolved. The book alternates between Henrietta Lacks' personal history, that of her family, a little of medical history and Skoot's actual pursuit of the story, which helps develop the story in historical context. Skoots included a lot more science than I expected, and even with ten years in the medical field, I was horrified at times. Skoots does a decent job of maintaining a journalistic tone, but some of the things she relates are terrible, from the way Henrietta grew up to cervical cancer treatment in the 50s and 60s. These were the days before cancer treatments approached the precision medicine it is aiming for today, and the treatments resembled nothing so much as trying to cut fingernails with garden shears. Just the thought of a radioactive seed tucked in the uterus causing tissue burn was enough to give me sympathetic cramps.Part of the evil in the book is the violence her family inflicted on each other, and it's one of the truly uncomfortable areas. I think that discomfort is important, because part of where this story comes from has to do with slavery and poverty. There isn't really an ethical high ground here, and that's part of Skoot's skill in setting up the story, and part of the problem in being a white woman telling the story of a black woman. The only reason I didn't give this a five star rating is that the narrative started to fall apart at the end, leaving behind the stories of the cell line and focus more on the breakdown of Henrietta's daughter, Deborah. While I understand she is the touchstone for the story, that she is partly telling the story of the mother through the daughter, much of Henrietta and the science is sidelined.Interesting questions popped up while reading; namely, why does everyone equate Henrietta's cancer cells with her person? As an illustration, if you tell people they have a cancerous tumor, the reaction is ""get rid of it."" It is categorized as ""other"" in everyone's mind and not recognized it as an intrinsic part of the person with cancer. It is not ""them."" Biologically speaking, I'm not sure the book answered the question of whether of not the HeLa cells actually were genetically identical to Henrietta, or if they were mutated--altered DNA. While that might be cold comfort, it's a huge philosophical and scientific question that is the pivot point for a number of issues. Treating the cells as if they were ""normal"" is part of what lead the scientists into disaster as evidenced by the discovery that so many cell lines were HeLa contaminated (I don't believe that transmission mechanism was explained either, which irks me). It also could be the basis for a sophisticated legal and ethical argument."

Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead in 1951. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سی و یکم ماه آگوست سال 2014 میلادیعنوان: حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس؛ نویسنده: ربکا اسکلاوت (اسکلوت)؛ مترجم: حسین راسی؛ تهران آرامش‏‫، 1390؛ در 426ص؛ شابک 9789649219165؛ موضوع: هنرییتا لکس از سال 1920م تا 1951م؛ بیماران و سرطان - اخلاق پزشکی - کشت یاخته ها - آزمایش روی انسان - سده 21م‬زندگینامه ی بیماری به نام «هنرییتا لکس» است، نامش «هنریتا لکس» بود، اما دانشمندان ایشان را با نام «هلا» میشناسند؛ یک کشاورز تنباکوی فقیر جنوب بود، که در همان سرزمین اجداد برده ی خود، کار میکردند، اما سلولهایش - که بدون آگاهی ایشان گرفته شده - به یکی از مهمترین ابزارهای پزشکی تبدیل شد؛ نخستین سلولهای «جاودانه»ی انسانی که، رشد یافته اند، و امروز هنوز هم زنده هستند، اگرچه ایشان در سال 1951میلادی درگذشته اند؛ اگر بتوانیم همه ی سلولهای «هلا» را که تکثیر شده اند، وزن کنیم، شاید وزن آنها به بیش از پنجاه میلیون تن برسد؛ سلولهای «هلا» برای ایجاد «واکسن فلج اطفال» حیاتی بودند؛ سلولهای ایشان، پرده از اسرار «سرطان»، «ویروسها» و اثرات «تشعشعات بمب اتم»؛ برداشتند؛ همچنین پیشرفتهایی همانند: «لقاح آزمایشگاهی»، «کلونینگ» و «نقشه برداری ژن»، یاری کرده است؛ و توسط میلیاردها انسان خریداری و فروخته شده اند؛ با اینحال «هنریتتا لکس» ناشناخته مانده، و در یک گور نامشخص دفن شده استاین کتاب به بخش‌های: برخورد اخلاق در حرفه پزشکی با نژادپرستی، و محرومیت‌های «تاریخی- اجتماعی» رنگین پوستان، برخورد جنبه‌ های معنوی، و حقوقی مالکیت بافت‌های بدن انسان، به تنگدستی و خرافات‌، و برخورد با اکتشاف‌ها، راهکارها، و شیوه ‌های نوین پزشکی هم پرداخته، و نکاتی خواندنی را پیش روی خوانشگر میگذارد؛ «حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس»: صحبت‌ها، یادمانهای نزدیکان «لکس»، و نگاهی به اسناد قانونی، و پرونده‌های پزشکی ایشان نیز هست؛ نگارنده، در این نوشتار علاوه بر نگارش تاریخچة زندگی «هنریتیا لکس» به معرفی «سلول‌های هیلا» و پاسخ‌گویی به پرسش‌‌هایی درباره ی دانش پزشکی، اخلاق، نژاد، و طبقه‌ بندی اجتماعی نیز، پرداخته استا. شربیانی"
140,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6050722-rachel,5,"Full disclosure: I come to this book from a weirdly fortuitous place. Take my brief, but mind-searing, stint in gynecologic oncology research ca. 2002, which involved a weekly trek to the OR to pick up still-warm tumors, with the women who informedly consented to donate them often open on the table as I did so. Then throw in two years working in a tissue culture hood, two more in a narrative nonfiction book group, and another big chunk of time studying infectious diseases. Mix in interests in social justice, bioethics, the history of science, and mysteries, and you’ve got me primed for some outsized adoration of Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, because its three main narratives are: 1) The history of tissue culture, particularly the contribution of the “immortal,” fabulously prolific HeLa cells that revolutionized medical research.2) The life, disease and death of Henrietta Lacks, the woman whose cervical cancer cells gave rise to the HeLa cell line.3) The story of Henrietta Lacks’s impoverished family, particularly her daughter Deborah, belatedly discovering and coping with their mother’s cellular legacy.Intertwined with all three is the concept of informed consent in scientific research, and who owns those bits of us and our genetic information that are floating around the research world. See? That perfect scientific/bioethical/historical mystery doesn’t come along every day. My expectations for this one were absolutely sky-high. And Rebecca Skloot hit it higher than that pile of 89 zillion HeLa cells. Thing is, my particular background can make reading about science kind of painfully bifurcated. I mean first, you’ve got your books that are all, “Yay! Science is totally objective and awesome and will solve all of our problems, so just shut up and trust it already!!” But then you’ve definitely also got your, “Science is just one (over-privileged and socially influenced) way of knowing among many / Medicine is patriarchal and wicked and economically motivated and pretty much out to get you, so avoid it at all costs” books too.Yes, Skloot could have written the story of a poor, black, female victim of evil white scientists. But she didn’t do that. Given her interests, it’s conceivable she could have written the triumphant history of tissue culture, and the amazing medical breakthroughs made possible by HeLa cells, and thank you for playing, poorblackwomanwhomnobodyknows. But she didn’t do that either. Instead, she spent ten years researching and writing a balanced, multifaceted book about the humans doing the science, the human whose cells made the science possible, and the humans profoundly affected by the actions of both. Her book is a complex tangle of race, class, gender and medicine. Of reason and faith. Of knowledge and ethics. Of the chasm between the beneficiaries of medical innovation and those without healthcare in the good old US of A.And Skloot doesn’t have the answers. We don’t get to tut-tut at how much things sucked in the past, while patting ourselves on the back for living in the enlightened present. This is vital and messy stuff, here. The problems haven’t been fixed. Who owns our pieces is an issue that is very much alive, and, with the current onslaught of new genetic information, becoming livelier by the minute. Which is why I would feel comfortable recommending this book to anyone involved in human-subjects research in any capacity...so a boatload of us, really, whether we know it or not.But, buyer beware: to tackle all this three-pronged complexity, Skloot uses a decidedly non-linear structure, one with a high narrative leaps:book length ratio. The three main narratives unfold together and inform each other: we meet Deborah Lacks, while learning about the fate of her mother, while learning about what HeLa cells can do, while learning about tissue culture innovators, while learning about the fate of Deborah Lacks. And Skloot saves the nuts and bolts of informed consent and the ownership of biological materials for a densely packed Afterward. Me, I found this to be a powerful structure and ate it all up with a spoon, but I can see how it could be a bit frustrating. You should also know that Skloot is in the book. According to Skloot herself, she fought against this for years. But you know what? I think she needs to be there. This is a book about adding the human complexity back into an illusion of objective scientific truth. When the author has become a character in the lives of her subjects, influencing events in their lives, it works to have the author be a textual presence disrupting the illusion of the objective journalistic truth. She only appears when it’s relevant to her subjects’ story; you don’t hear anything about her story that doesn’t pertain to theirs. And having been in that narrative nonfiction book group for two years, Skloot’s stands out as an elegant and thoughtful approach to the author/subject connection (self-reported femme-fatale author of The Angel of Grozny: Orphans of a Forgotten War, I’m looking at you so hard right now.)
This book pairs well with:
 The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures, another excellent, non-judgmental book about the intersection of science, medicine and culture. With The Mismeasure of Man, for more on the fallibility of the scientific process. It would also taste really good with a kick-ass book about the history of biomedical ethics in the United States, so if you know of one, I’d love to hear about it!"
141,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"I am late to this book party, but let me explain: I get twitchy about medical stuff. Earlier this year I had to abandon Rosemary Mahoney's book about the blind because it described an eye surgery. I have never been able to finish Dr. Atul Gawande's Complications because of its description of medical procedures. It was a small miracle that I was able to finish the Call the Midwife series, because I hate childbirth scenes. When this Henrietta Lacks book started tearing up the bestseller lists a few years ago, I read a few reviews and thought, ""Yeah, that can wait.""Then I started a new library job, and the Lacks book was chosen as a Common Read for the campus. Guess who was volun-told to help lead upcoming book discussions? (Hint: it was me.)So, with a deep sigh, I started reading. And then, oh happy day, my fears turned out to be unfounded because I ended up really liking the story. Rebecca Skloot wrote that she first heard about Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells in a community college biology class. Lacks was a black woman who died in 1951 from cervical cancer. Before she died, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. A key part of this story is that Henrietta did not know her tissue had been taken, and doctors did not tell her family.Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in culture for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal cells ever grown in a laboratory.Henrietta's cells, nicknamed HeLa, were given to scientists and researchers around the world, and they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, Parkinson's disease, and they helped with innumerable other medical studies over the decades. At first, the cells were given for free, but some companies were set up to sell vials of HeLa, which became a lucrative enterprise. The reason Henrietta's cells were so precious was because they allowed scientists to perform experiments that would have been impossible with a living human. They cut HeLa cells apart and exposed them to endless toxins, radiation, and infections. They bombarded them with drugs, hoping to find one that would kill malignant cells without destroying normal ones. They studied immune suppression and cancer growth by injecting HeLa cells into immune-compromise rats, which developed malignant tumors much like Henrietta's. If the cells died in the process, it didn't matter -- scientists could just go back to their eternally growing HeLa stock and start over again.Unfortunately, the Lacks family did not know about any of this until several decades after Henrietta had died, and some relatives became very upset and felt betrayed by the doctors at Hopkins. A few threatened to sue the hospital, but never did.There is a lot of biology and medical discussion in this book, but Skloot also tried to learn more about Henrietta's life, and she was able to interview Lacks' relatives and children. Additionally, there is some good discussion on the ethics of taking tissue samples from patients without their consent, and on the problem of racism in health care.""I always have thought it was strange, if our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can't afford to see no doctors? Don't make no sense. People got rich off my mother without us even known about them takin her cells now we don't get a dime. I used to get so mad about that to where it made me sick and I had to take pills. But I don't got it in me no more to fight. I just want to know who my mother was."" -- Deborath Lacks, who was very young when her mother diedMy favorite parts of the book were the stories about Henrietta and the Lacks family, and the discussions on race and ethics in health care. There's no indication that Henrietta questioned [her doctor]; like most patients in the 1950s, she deferred to anything her doctors said. This was a time when 'benevolent deception' was a common practice -- doctors often withheld even the most fundamental information from their patients, sometimes not giving them any diagnosis at all. They believed it was best not to confuse or upset patients with frightening terms they might not understand, like cancer. Doctors knew best, and most patients didn't question that. Especially black patients in public wards. This was 1951 in Baltimore, segregation was law, and it was understood that black people didn't question white people's professional judgment. Many black patients were just glad to be getting treatment, since discrimination in hospitals was widespread.Skloot worked on the book for more than a decade, paying for research trips with student loans and credit card debt. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in medical ethics, biology, or just some good investigative reporting. Favorite Quote""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different."" -- Deborah Lacks"
142,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61753513-christy,5,"I do believe this book must have scored near the top of all books used in college courses these last 5-6 years - from English to history and social sciences, but I wonder how much traction it got in medical school and across the healthcare and medical research fields. It quickly became a ""classic"" because so many issues are covered: race, class, gender, genetics, property rights, and about the social ends of science and our technological choices. As well, it's a story of how some people are used by institutions for other ends, whether admirably or not, and how unjust and unfair it was to Henrietta to have her cancer cells taken without her permission. She died at age 31 from the cancer, yet the gene treatment her cells produced is tremendously useful in the medical field and will be for a long time to come, hence her ""immortal"" status, yet it gives little comfort to the reader. Ironically, her own family now suffers from a lack of access to healthcare.Kudos to author Skloot who started a the Henrietta Lacks Foundation to help families like the Lacks with healthcare and other financial needs, including more victims of similar experiences, including those of the infamous Tuskeegee experiment with treating only some Black soldiers with syphilis. You can check it out at http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/"
143,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020736-stacey,5,"I've started and erased my little book commentary so many times because this story is so overwhelming and so important on multiple levels, I'm not sure anything I could say about it would do justice to the complexity and dichotomy of the story surrounding Henrietta Lacks. It might not be far from the truth to state that she was the most important person who ever lived. A physical part of her body has saved hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of lives, and improved the lives of countless others. And her story is not over yet. Her cells are still being used in medical research all over the world. But these benefits came at the cost of a violation of her rights, in a time when it was commonplace for doctors and researchers to just do and take, without consent, especially among poor populations and people of color. Some of the things done with Henrietta's cells saved lives, some were heinous experiments performed on people who had no idea what was being done to them, in a grotesquely distorted and amplified reflection of what was done to Henrietta. Nuremberg was dismissed in the United States as something that only applied to the fallen Nazi's. Any act was justifiable in the name of science. And yet, some of the things done right her in our own nation were reminiscent of the research being conducted under the direction of the notorious Dr. Mengele.Reading certain parts of this book, I found myself holding my breath in horror at some of the ideas conjured by medical practioners in the name of “research.” Of course, we know.* Anyone who is even moderately informed on this nation's medical history knows about the Tuskegee trials, MK Ultra, flu and hepatitis research on the disabled and incarcerated, radiation exposure experiments on hospital patients, and cancer, cancer, cancer. The poor, disabled and people of color in this country, the “land of the free,” have been subjected to so many cancer experiments, it defies belief. Many of these trials, including some devised of Henrietta's cells, have involved injecting cancer, non-consensually, into human subjects. So while it is true that there can be utterly no doubt that our lives, and the lives of much of the world, are better, because of the knowledge made possible by parts of Henrietta Lacks's body, still acknowledgment of this reality comes at the cost of knowing that procedures were performed on her without her knowledge or understanding, and without her consent, with impunity; these actions were made even easier because she was poor, black and female, and this is to say nothing of the numerous and unethical violations of her (and her children's) privacy. It's an old story. It's a story that her biographer, Rebecca Skloot, handles with grace and compassion. Henrietta is not some medical spectacle, she was a real woman. If she has been deified by her friends and family since her death, it is maybe the homage that she deserves, not for her cells, but for her vibrance, kindness, and the tragedy of a mother who died much too young. There are a great many scientific and historical facts presented in this book, facts that I couldn't possibly vet for veracity, but the science seems sound, if simplistic, and the history is presented in a conversational way, that is easy to read, and uninterrupted by footnotes and references. Family recollections are presented in storyteller fashion, which makes for easy and compelling reading. Fact-checking is made easy by a list of references, presented in chapter-by-chapter appendices. Rarely do I read something that makes me want to collar strangers in the street and tell them, “You MUST read this book,” but this is one of those times. Henrietta's story is bigger than medical research, and cures for polio, and the human genome, and Nuremberg. Henrietta's story is about basic human rights, and autonomy, and love. It's about knowledge and power, how it's human nature to find a way to justify even the worst things we can devise in the name of the greater good, and how we turn our science into a god. This story is bigger than Rebecca Skloot's book. But I am grateful that she wrote it, and thankful to have read it. Would the story have changed had Henrietta been given the opportunity to give her informed consent? That's the thread of mystery which runs through the entire story, the answer to which we can never know. *documentation in this list is inconsistent, but most of these experiments can be independently verified."

145,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,4,"A lot to process with this book. This book's been out for a while, so I'm just going to put down a bunch of thoughts rattling around in my head, and probably leave it at that:-legacy left by slavery and how it affected Henrietta Lacks and the members of her family, and African Americans in general (where they lived, what kind of employment was available to them, the quality of education available to them, the history of abuse and violence, and the impact on their mental health, and the quality and availability of healthcare)-the assumptions and treatment by the medical establishment, at the time, of their patients and patients' rights-the lack of laws, or their lack of clarity, around a patient's consent, and the ownership of a patient's waste products from medical procedures. This was well illustrated in this book, from the 1950s to the time of the book's publication. -the quality of scientific education and knowledge in the general public. Unless people have some understanding of science, how are they to know what questions to ask of their doctors? The more affluent will generally fare better here, I suspect, what with their access to probably better trained teachers, and the ability to get higher education. And affluence and better outcomes would be partially dependent on where one started out in life.-thank goodness medical procedures improve over time, or are retired in favour of treatments that work!!-bioethics--thank goodness there is debate and evolution of ideas and laws. Though there are probably still lots of grey areas around research and commercializations -I was interested to find out more about the point raised about the DNA of the cell descendants of Henrietta's original cancerous cells.-I was sickened by the treatment, or perhaps I should say mystery around the treatment of Elsie, Henrietta's eldest daughter at the hospital for the insane. Or what doctors could call insane at the time.This was a painful read, but an important accounting of a part of US history, and more specifically, the legacy of slavery on a family, and the changing attitudes and practices in medicine and science."
146,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"I am not sure how is it in other countries but here in the Philippines, if you bring your car for repair in a service center and the serviceman says that he replaced a part, you how to do in you should find that replaced part inside your car. I think it is their proof that they actually replaced that part and also for you to decide how you want to dispose, resell, reuse or recycle it. Normally, this practice bothers me because I have a very small space for junks at home and I do not know what to do with a malfunctioning compressor, air vent, axle, mudguard, leaking pipes, tubes, coolant container, etc. What am I going to do with them? The only thing I know w.r.t. car is how to replace the battery or a flat tire. So, I always end up giving those away to the poor junk man so as to have something to load in his pushcart.It may not be the best analogy to introduce a very compelling book like this. However, the logic is the same. The organ, tissue, cells or fluids that you left in the hospital during your last hospitalization or check-up is totally different from the car spare parts. But both are left after you get what you want and you think they are of no use to you anymore. You gave the authorization for the part to be removed and replaced (if possible) and you deserve to have the replaced unit because legally, you are still the owner of the original or replaced part. However, just like me and the car junks, I would imagine that you don't want to bring home with you some test tubes filled with your excess coagulated blood, liquified Chlorox-smelling semen, miniscule torn ligaments or decayed tooth. What are you going to do with them? Henrietta Lacks, a poor black Tobacco farmer, died of cervical cancer in 1951. Without her knowledge, the doctors got her cancerous tissue and tried to use its cells in a cell culture. Surprise. Surprise. Henrietta's cells propagate like wild fire and they are still alive up to now. It was the first successful cell culture since in all the previous attempts, the cells only lived for few days before dying. The book explains that in Henrietta's chromosomes has enzyme called telomerase that continuously rebuils the telomere which is a string of DNA found at the end of each of Henrietta's chromosome. Skloot says in her introduction that there is more to this, as well as other issues, but apologizes for not excluding them in this book's scope. That's fine with me, because the scientific discussions in the book are just enough for me not to fall asleep and lose interest. We all took Biology in high school and the Cell and its parts, how they work, etc is always that's subject's first lesson so I think you can get by.So what if Henrietta's cells are still alive today? Medical discoveries still happen and we don't know or don't care to know their history. Well, those cells have been used to developed vaccines for polio, gene mapping, cloning, etc. So? Well, Henrietta's cancer cells were used without her or her families consent. Henrietta died 2 weeks after being diagnosed with cervical cancer and she was so poor she had to be buried in an unmarked grave. So? Well, Henrietta was black and the doctors were white. In the 50's, America was still not so open with mixing the two colors. The whites probably would not want to have anything in their body taken from a black person. So? This book tackles a number of controversial questions on medical ethics, racism and social discrimination. However, this is not a serious boring book. Skloot's storytelling does not leave any tinge of textbook formality and this can be read just like any A-grade medical crime bestseller that has some sprinklings of family drama (Henrietta's children have to be given away to relatives after her death), incest (10-y/o Rebecca, Henrietta's daughter, escapes a horny uncle showing his erect penis and she does not know the meaning of a rigid penis) and the struggles of a black family despite having a world-renowned mother whose cells, called the HeLa cells, make a unprecedented contribution to the medical field and in prolonging our life expectancy.So? Well, what if the same thing happens to you? What are the chances that your excess semen was not put in the wastebasket but stored in a sperm bank and given away to childless couples for in vitro fertilization of the wife's ovum? Then what if that child becomes the new Einstein? a new Picasso? a new Shakespeare? a new G.G.Marquez? I'm just saying...  "
147,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3893454-christina,4,"This was an interesting read. While I applaud Skloot's attempt to present a fair look at the history of the HeLa cell line used in research labs all over the world, the book is clearly skewed toward sympathy for the family. Not that they don't deserve sympathy, but really, the problems of the family is NOT the fault of anyone involved with the cell line. Don't get me wrong, Henrietta and her family have had a hard life, and they do deserve some sympathy. But not for this particular issue.The sad fact is that Henrietta died of an aggressive cancer, leaving her family to live their lives without her. That was not her fault or the fault of her family, but it was also not the fault of the hospital staff of Johns Hopkins. Yes, there was racial and socio-economic discrimination, but the fact remains that Henrietta was treated to best of the ability of the doctors at that time. Do we view the taking of cell samples from Henrietta without her permission as unethical today? Most people would say yes. But the law still remains unclear about that, and in 1954 that was most certainly not seen as unethical - it was common practice. So in the context of the time, the act was not unethical. As for monetary compensation, Johns Hopkins did not profit from the growth of HeLa cells; in fact, the scientist that first worked with HeLa cells GAVE the cells away to many many many other labs FOR FREE. Those labs shared with other labs, etc. Are there companies that profit from the cells now? Yes. But they got the cells the same way everyone else did back then - for free. The company then did their own research to find a way to mass produce, store and ship living cells. At the point the first company started mass producing and selling the cells the identity of the donor was long hidden, and the fact the cells were widespread at that time made them common property, so people in possession of the cells could do pretty much anything they wanted with them. And now for the part that is a little stickier - the family found out about Henrietta's cells, were (sort of) tricked into donating blood and cell samples and were kept in the dark about the cell line for decades. Was that right? NO, absolutely not. HOWEVER, I will point out that some of the subsequent anger, confusion and fear on the part of the family was due to their extreme lack of education rather than a malicious attempt to prey upon the Lacks family. The science presented in the book is simplified somewhat for the lay person, which is nice, as is the look at the advances in medicine and research that HeLa cells have brought to the world. As a scientist, however, I think that Skloot's explanations were a little fuzzy and did not really dispel most people's image of how science works in the real world. Perhaps a little more objectivity and less family bonding would have made this a better book.In conclusion: though Skloot claims she tries to give an unbiased view of the history of HeLa cells and the family from whence it came, I am concerned that lay people who read this will not understand some of the finer points and it will increase the already rampant fear of science that pervades American culture. The majority of Americans are woefully un-educated in the sciences, to the point that many people view it as no different than magic,but weirder and scarier. "

And the way she told Henrietta's story was beautiful and almost reflective of Henrietta's life. The story started at a point and then spread out to become a story that enveloped all of humanity. I read this as more research on Henrietta for my forthcoming novel THE BOOK OF PHOENIX and it was exactly what I needed and wanted. I wanted the science but I also wanted the close personal narrative of this woman and the people in her life; I wanted the good, the bad and the ugly. This book was all of that. Some of it is lovely, some was disturbing, plenty of it as shocking, and lots of it was heart-breaking. Her story is so deeplyAmerican. Also, it was really cool how close the writer got to the narrative. and eventually became a part of it. I love that. Oh and there's a touch of African magic in the story, which didn't surprise me at ALL, considering what this book was about. <3'd this book!"

The tedious, repetitious ones that you could have sworn you already completed at least a thousand times? Next time you sigh loudly or roll your eyes at the prospect of this task, think about the people who came before us who were never offered the luxury of informed consent, confidentiality, and protection from discrimination. Horrendous injustices prompted these forms into action so that history does not repeat itself. It's a sad thought.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks offers historical insight into human rights issues within the medical field. Primarily though, it focuses on the woman behind the most famous and widely researched human cells in the world: Henrietta Lacks. Her name has only recently become known to the world which is quite sad, but thanks to her family's perseverance and Rebecca Skloot's heavy research and publication, the world now knows who to credit with most medical advances to date. It has been reported that Ms. Lacks had no knowledge of her contribution, as she was unaware that tissues were saved after multiple cancer biopsies/treatments, and therefore, she gave no permission for her cells to be used in any way, shape, or form, but Ms. Skloot reminds us that even today, none of us have any say over what is done with our cells and tissues once removed from our bodies. I appreciated Ms. Skloot's attention to Ms. Lacks' remaining family members and their immense struggles in spite of all the progress (and profits) made in the medical field. In my opinion though, she was a bit too forthcoming in regards to the family. Factors related to race, poverty, education, medical issues, disabilities, and access to healthcare are definitely warranted in a book like this to show the overall contrast between those benefiting from Ms. Lacks' contribution and the family that was left behind, along with the insensitivity and injustice of it all. However, criminal histories, superstitions, and mental illness had no place in this book in my opinion. I believe this was potentially harmful to the family's character, and some portions of the book painted the family in a money-hungry and incompetent light which was unnecessary even if that may have been Ms. Skloot's perception or experience. Regardless, the family's inclusion in this book did make all the difference and I thoroughly enjoyed my reading experience.

He started shaking my hand and wormed his way into the house.“Mr. Kemper, I’m John Doe with Dee-Bag Industries Incorporated. I need you to sign some paperwork and take a ride with me. Don’t worry, I’ll have you home in a day or two,” he said. Then he pulled a document out of his briefcase, set it on the coffee table and pushed a pen in my hand. “Wait a second. What the hell is this all about?” I said as I tried to pick up the paper to read it, but Doe kept trying to force my hand with the pen down on it so I couldn‘t see what it said.“Oh, that’s just legal mumbo-jumbo. You’d rather try and read your mortgage agreement than this old thing. Just put your name down and let’s be on our way, shall we?” he said.There was a brief scuffle, but I managed to distract him by messing up his carefully gelled hair. As he shrieked and ran around looking for a mirror, I finally got to read the document.“This is a medical consent form. What’s going on?” I demanded as I shook the paper at him. Once he had combed and smoothed his hair back into perfection, Doe sighed.“Very well, Mr. Kemper. I guess I’ll have to come clean. Do you remember when you had your appendix out when you were in grade school?”“Sure. That gave me one of my better scars, but that was like 30 years ago. Why are you here now?” I asked.“You’re probably not aware of this, but your appendix was used in a research project by DBII,” Doe said.“Really? I assumed it just got incinerated or used in the hospital cafeteria’s meatloaf special. Why would anyone want to study my rotten appendix?”“Oh, all kinds of research is done on tissue gathered during medical procedures. Most people don’t know that, but it’s very common,” Doe said.“OK, but why are you here now?”“Well, your appendix turned out to be very special. It was secreting some kind of pus that no one had seen before. After many tests, it turned out to be a new chemical compound with commercial applications. So a patent was filed based on that compound and turned into a consumer product,” Doe admitted.“That sounds disgusting. What was it used in? Because I want to make sure to never buy it,” I said.“It’s the basis for the adhesive on Post-It Notes,” Doe said.“Are you freaking kidding me? Post-It Notes are based on my old appendix?”“I’m absolutely serious, Mr. Kemper. Now we at DBII need your help. Unfortunately for us, you haven’t had anything removed lately. So I have to get your consent if we’re going to do further studies,” Doe said.“But you already got my goo-seeping appendix. I don’t have another one,” I said. “True, but sales have been down for Post-It Notes lately. So after the marketing and research boys talked it over for a while, they thought we should bring you in for a full body scan. Maybe you’ve got a spleen giving out or something else that we could pull out and see if we could use it,” Doe said.“This is pretty damn disturbing,” I said.“Why? You’re an organ donor, right? Same thing,” Doe said.“I don’t consider someone lucking into an organ if the Chiefs win a play-off game and I have a goddamn heart attack the same thing as companies making money off tissue I had removed decades ago and didn’t know anything about,” I said.“Fortunately, the American government and legal system disagree. So how about it, Mr. Kemper? Will you come with me?” Doe asked.“I dunno. What’s my end of this? You already owe me a fat check for the Post-Its.”“Oh, no. You won’t get any money from the Post-Its, or if any future discoveries from your tissues lead to more gains.” Doe said.“That’s complete bullshit!”“Again, the legal system disagrees with you. But this is for science, Mr. Kemper. You don’t want to hold up medical scientific research that could save lives, do you?”“It’s for Post-It Notes!”“Maybe, but who is to say that the cure for some terrible disease isn't lurking somewhere in your genes? Could you live with yourself if you prevented crucial medical research just because you were ticked off that you didn’t get any money for your appendix? Remember that it’s not like you could have NOT had your appendix removed. At least, not if you wanted to keep living. And I highly doubt that you would have had the resources to have it studied and discovered the adhesive for yourself even if you would have taken it home with you in a jar after it was removed. We’re the ones who spent all that money to get some good out of a piece of disgusting gunk that tried to kill you. So shouldn’t we be compensated? What are you? Some kind of damn dirty hippie liberal socialist?” Doe said in disgust“You’re a hell of a corporate lackey, Doe,” I said.“Thank you.”“Fine. I’ll do it,” I said as I signed the form. “But I want some free Post-It Notes.”“No deal. Steal them from work like everyone else,” Doe said.******Obviously, I‘m a big fat liar and none of this happened, but I really did have my appendix out as a kid. Plus, my tonsils got yanked and I’ve had my fair share of blood taken over the years. What this book taught me is that it’s highly likely that some of my scraps are sitting in frozen jars in labs somewhere. Yours, too. If any of us have anything unique in our tissues that may be valuable for medical research, it’s possible that they’d be worth a fortune, but we’d never see a dime of it.Henrietta Lacks couldn’t be considered lucky by any stretch of the imagination. A black woman who grew up poor on a tobacco farm, she married her cousin and moved to the Baltimore area. Her husband apparently liked to step out on her and Henrietta ended up with STDs, and one of her children was born mentally handicapped and had to be institutionalized. In 1951, Henrietta was diagnosed with cervical cancer by doctors at Johns Hopkins. During her biopsy, cell samples were taken and given to a researcher who had been working on the problem of trying to grow human cells. Henrietta’s cancer spread wildly, and she was dead within a year. But her cells turned out to be an incredible discovery because they continued growing at a very fast rate. The doctor at Johns Hopkins started sharing his find for no compensation, and this coincided with a large need for cell samples due to testing of the polio vaccine. The HeLa cells would be crucial for confirming that the vaccine worked and soon companies were created to grow and ship them to researchers around the world. Since then, Henrietta’s cells have been sent into outer space and subjected to nuclear tests and cited in over 60,000 medical research papersUnfortunately, no one ever asked Henrietta’s permission and her family knew nothing about the important role her cells played in medicine for decades. Poor and with little formal education, Henrietta’s children were confused by what was actually done to their mother and upset when they learned that her tissue was part of a multi-million dollar industry that they‘ve received no compensation from..Rebecca Skloot has written a fascinating book that clearly outlines why Henrietta’s cells were so important, why she went unrecognized for decades, the pain it’s caused her family, and the way that new medical discoveries over the last sixty years have opened a potential Pandora’s Box of legal and ethical issues regarding tissue collection, research, patents and money. This book brings up a lot of issues that we’re probably all going to be dealing with in the future. Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog."
151,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"This is an all-gold five star read.It's actually two stories, the story of the HeLa cells and the story of the Lacks family told by a journalist who writes the first story objectively and the second, in which she is involved, subjectively. The contrast between the poor Lacks family who cannot afford their medical bills and the research establishment who have made millions, maybe billions from these cells is ironic and tragic. It has been established by other law cases that if the family had gone for restitution they would not have got it, but that's a moot point as they couldn't afford a lawyer in any case. I have seen some bad reviews about this book. People who think that the story of the Lacks - poor rural African-Americans who never made it 'up' from slavery and whose lifestyle of decent working class folk that also involves incest, adultery, disease and crime, they just dismiss with 'heard it all before' and 'my family despite all obstacles succeeded so what is wrong with the Lacks?' I wonder if these people who not only totally can't see the wonderful writing that brings these people to life and who so lack in compassion themselves are the sort of people who oppose health care for the masses? As an extremely wealthy American tourist once put it to me, he had earned good health care by his hard work and success in life, it was one of the perks, why waste good money on, say, a a triple-bypass on someone who hasn't even succeeded enough to afford health insurance? That they were a drain on society, non-contributors and not the way America needed to go to move forward.I don't think you can rate people by what they have achieved materially. Success depends a great deal on opportunity and many don't have that. Henrietta Lacks didn't have it and her children didn't have it, not even her grandchildren made much of a way for themselves, but the next generation, the great grandchildren - ah now they are going in for Masters degrees and maybe their children will be major contributors. The author intends to recompense the family by setting up a scholarship for at least one of them. All of us came originally from poverty and to put down those that are still mired in the quicksand of never having enough spare cash to finance an education is cruel, uncompassionate and hardly looking to the future.HeLa cells have given us our future. They are the most researched and tested human cells in existence. All of us have benefited from the medical advances made using them and the book is recognition of what a great contribution Henrietta Lacks and her family with all their donations of tissue and blood, mostly stolen from them under false pretences, have made. Indeed one of the researchers who looks like having told a lot of lies (and then lied about that) in order to get the family to donate blood to further her research is still trying to get them to donate more. She's a hard-nosed scientist, with an excellent job and income and to her the Lacks are no more than providers of raw material. Sometimes you can't make hard and fast rulings. No I don't think we should have to give informed consent for experiments to be done on tissue or blood donated during a procedure or childbirth - that would slow medical research unbearably. I don't think cells should be identifiable with the donor either, it should be quite anonymous (as it now is). However, there is only ever one 'first' in any sphere and that one does deserve recognition and now with the book, some 50 years after her life ended, Henrietta Lacks has it. Good on yer, Rebecca Skloot, you've done a good thing here."

“She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?”
I've moved this book on and off my TBR for years. The truth is that, with few exceptions, I'm generally turned off by the thought of non-fiction. I'm a fan of fictional stories, and I think I've always felt that non-fiction will be dry, boring and difficult to get through. Especially a book about science, cells and medicine when I'm more of a humanities/social sciences kinda girl.But this book... it's just so interesting. It's written in a very easy, journalistic style and places the author into the story (some people didn't like this, but I thought it felt like you were going along for the journey). It's all the interesting bits of science, full of eye-opening and shocking discoveries, but it's also about history, sociology and race.I started reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks while sat next to my boyfriend. Every so often I would unknowingly gasp or mutter ""oh my god"" and he was like ""what? what?"" and I hadn't even realized I'd done it out loud. It's just full of surprises - and every one is true! It uncovers things you almost certainly didn't know about. And it just shows that sometimes real life can be nastier, more shocking, and more wondrous than anything you could imagine.Maybe you've heard of HeLa in passing, maybe you don't know anything about these cells that helped in cancer research, in finding a polio vaccine, in cloning, in gene mapping and discovering the effects of an atom bomb; either way, this tells an incredible and awful story of a poor, black woman in the American South who was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She is given back her humanity, becoming more than a cluster of cells and being shown for the tough, spirited woman she was. From her own family life to the frankly nauseating treatment of black patients in the 1950s, her story emerges.Not only that, but this book is about the injustices committed by the pharmaceutical industry - both in this individual case (how is it that Henrietta's family are dirt poor when she has revolutionized medicine?) and on a larger scale (during the 1950s, many prisoners were injected with cancer as part of medical experiments!). It's hard to believe what so-called ""professionals"" have gotten away with throughout history - things that we generally associate with Nazi death camps.I honestly could not put it down. Maybe because it's not just about science and cells, but is mainly about all of the humanity and social history behind scientific discoveries. Maybe because Skloot is so damn passionate about her subject and that passion is transferred to the reader. Whatever the reason, I highly recommend it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"
153,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"This was a really good book that leaves one with more questions than it answers, especially at this moment with the explosion in investment and growth in health/biotech. A lot of those questions are ones I wouldn't know how to answer myself either. I think it's really important though that we all start grappling with and instituting better processes around things like informed consent. Also really horrible to think about this in larger societal terms, in the context of institutional racism, and the ways in which the Lacks family still is so socioeconomically disadvantaged while private biotechnology companies sell their mother's cells for so much money. I just feel so extremely uncomfortable with that. I think I wouldn't care so much if the cells were just part of the commons, available for free, or extremely cheaply, but to know people are profiting off of it, it really is quite disgusting. I try not to bring my politics to bear here quite too often but this really really makes me feel strongly that commercialization of things in biological research, especially people's biological matter and tissue shouldn't be happening. This whole situation just feels quite perverse honestly and the book left me feeling disheartened. The dual dehumanization of the Lacks family through science and commercialization is horrifying. And I think if we wants things to be better moving forward both need to be addressed, not just one."
154,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"On October 4, 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a thirty-one-year old black woman, died after a gruesome battle with a rapidly metastasizing cancer. During her treatment, the doctors at Johns Hopkins took some cells from her failing body and used them for research. This was not an unusual thing to have done in 1951. But the cells that came from Ms. Lacks’ body were unusual. They had qualities that made them uniquely valuable as research tools. Labeled “HeLa”, Henrietta’s cells were reproduced by the billions over the following sixty years and have been instrumental in experiments across a wide range of biological science. Today, HeLa cells are sold by the vial at impressive prices. Yet, Ms. Lacks’ family has seen not a penny of compensation from the work that has been made possible by their relative’s unique cells. Rebecca Skloot - from Powell'sRebecca Skloot, a science writer with articles published in many major outlets, spent years looking into the genesis of these cells. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells four stories. First is the tale of HeLa cells, and the value they have been to science; second is the life of, arguably, the most important cell “donor” in history, and of her family; third is a look at the ethics of cell “donation” and the commercial and legal significance of rights involved; and fourth is the Visible Woman look at Skloot’s pursuit of the tales. Each story is significant. The contribution of HeLa cells has been huge and it is important to know how these cells came to be so widely used, and what are the characteristics that make them so valuable. Skloot goes into a reasonable level of detail for those of us who do not make our living in a lab coat. She adds information on how cell cultures can become contaminated, and how that impacts completed research. She also offers a description of telomeres, strings of DNA at the end of chromosomes critical to longevity, and key to the immortality of HeLa cells. Fascinating stuff. Henrietta Lacks - From Science And FilmSkloot constructs a biography of Henrietta, and patches together a portrait of the life of her family, from her ancestors to her children, siblings and other relations. It is with a source of pride, among other emotions, that her family regards Henrietta’s impact on the world. Skloot delves into these feelings, and the experiences the Lacks family members have had over the decades with people trying to write about Henrietta, and people trying to exploit their interest in Henrietta for dark purposes.The author had to overcome considerable family resistance before she was able to get them to meet with and ultimately open up to her. She takes us through her process, showing who she talked with, when, and the result of those conversations, what institutions she contacted re locating and gaining access to information about Henrietta and some other family members. Most interesting, and at times frustrating, is her story of how she gained the trust of some, if not all, of the Lacks family. This is like presenting a how-to of her research process, a blow-by-blow description of the way research is done in the real world, and it is very enlightening.The Immortal Tale of Henrietta Lacks has received considerable acclaim. It is all well-deserved. The book is an eye-opening window into a piece of our history that is mostly unknown. It presents science in a very manageable way and gives us plenty to think about the next time we have a blood test or any other medical procedure. This book may not be as immortal as Henrietta’s cells, but it will stay with you for a very long time.The HBO Film airs on April 22, 2017==============================EXTRA STUFF8/8/13 - NY Times article - A Family Consents to a Medical Gift, 62 Years Later3/29/17 - Washington Post - On the eve of an Oprah movie about Henrietta Lacks, an ugly feud consumes the family - by Steve Hendrix"

Strengths:
*Fantastically interesting subject!One woman's cancerous cells are multiplied and distributed around the globe enabling a new era of cellular research and fueling incredible advances in scientific methodology, technology, and medical treatments. This strain of cells, named HeLa (after Henrietta Lacks their originator), has been amazingly prolific and has become integrated into advancements of science around the world (space travel, genome research, pharmaceutical treatments, polio vaccination, etc). *Thought-Provoking Ethical Questions This book makes you ponder ethical questions historically raised by the unfolding sequence of events and still rippling currently. Ex. 1) Informed consent: Henrietta did not provide informed consent (not required in those days). Ex. 2) Genetic rights/non-rights: her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later. Ex. 3) Patents and profits for biologic material: zero profits realized by Henrietta or her descendants; multiple-millions in profits have been realized by individuals and corporations utilizing her genetic material.*Biographical description of Henrietta and interviews with her family.  The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications. We're reading about actual, valuable people and historic events.
Weaknesses:
*Framework: the book is framed around the author's journey of writing the story and her interactions with Henrietta's family. I thought the author got in the way and would have preferred to have to read less of her journey and more coverage of the science involved and its ethical implications. I found myself distinctly not caring how many times the author circled the block or how many trips she made to Henrietta's birthplace.*Lack of Clarity: By mid-point through the book, I was wishing the biographical approach was more refined and focused. The narrative swerved through the author's interest in various people as she encountered them along the way: Henrietta, Henrietta's immediate family, scientists, Henrietta's extended family, a neighborhood grocery store owner, a con artist, Henrietta's youngest daughter, Henrietta's oldest daughter, etc. Everything was a side dish; no particular biography satisfied as a main course.
Bottom Line:
This book won't join my 'to re-read' shelf...but has whetted my appetite for further exploration of this important woman, fascinating topic and intriguing ethical questions.I was left wanting more:-more detail surrounding the science involved, -more coverage of past and present ethical implications-a more refined biography of Henrietta, and -a more focused look at the impact and implications of the HeLa cell strain line on Henrietta's descendants."

A young black mother dies of cervical cancer in 1950 and unbeknownst to her becomes the impetus for many medical advances through the decades that follow because of the cancer cells that were taken without her permission. This book evokes so many thoughts and feelings, sometimes at odds with one another. It is thought provoking and informative in the details and heartbreaking in the rendering of the personal story of Henrietta Lacks. I was madder than hell that people/companies made loads of money on the Hela cell line while some members of the Lacks family didn’t have health insurance . Yet, I am grateful for the research advances that made a polio vaccine possible, advanced cancer research and genetics, and so much more.Rebecca Skloot does a wonderful job of presenting the moral and legal questions of medical research without consent meshing this with the the human side giving a picture of the woman whose cells saved so many lives. We get to know her family, especially her daughter Deborah who worked tirelessly with the author to discover what happened to her mother. This made it all so real - not just a recitation of the facts. The scientific aspects are very detailed but understandable. It was the sections on Henrietta and her family that I wanted to read the most.In 1950 there was “no formal research oversight in the United States.” Years later there are laws on “informed consent “ and how medical research is conducted, and protection of privacy for medical records. Yet even today, there are controversies over the ownership of human tissue. The in depth research over years in writing this book is evident and I believe a heartfelt effort to recognize Henrietta Lacks for her unwitting contribution to medical research."
158,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114573-chelsea,3,"This could have been an incredible book. Henrietta Lacks' story is finally told--and Skloot makes very clear how important Lacks' cells have been to the last 60 years of science and, paradoxically, how much Henrietta and her family suffered because those cells were taken from Henrietta without her consent. But in her effort to contrast the importance and profitability of Henrietta's cells with the marginalization and impoverishment of Henrietta's family, Skloot makes three really big mistakes. First, she's not transparent about her own journalistic ethics, which is troubling in a book about ethics. Did the Lacks family end up benefiting from her book financially? Did all Lacks give permission for their depictions in the book? We never know. Second, Skloot's narration when describing the Lacks family suffering--sexual abuse, addiction, disability, mental illness--lacks sensitivity; it often feels clinical and sometimes even voyeuristic. Again, this is disturbing in a book that concerns the importance of dignity, consent, etc.Finally, Skloot inserts herself into the story over and over, not so subtly suggesting that she is a hero for telling Henrietta's story. Sometimes, it appears that she is making the very offensive suggestion that she, a highly educated unreligious white woman, has healed the Lacks family by showing them science and history."
159,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731872-kathleen,3,"My thoughts on this book are kind of all over the place. I feel for the Lacks family, I really do. It's hard to read about the poverty and lack of education and the cavalier approach towards informed consent in the early days of Johns Hopkins Research Hospital. The fact that the HeLa cell line is the foundation of so much valuable research is rightfully a source of pride for the family of Henrietta Lacks. I don't think they will ever see monetary compensation for their mother's cancer cell line, however. That horse left the barn a long, long time ago.Furthermore, I don't feel the admiration for the author of this book like I think many others do. She wanted to make herself out to be different than all the rest of the people who wrote about the woman behind the HeLa cell line but I only saw the similarities. Yes, she has established a scholarship fund for the descendants of Henrietta Lacks but I got tired of hearing again and again how she financed her research herself. I think the exploitation is there, just prettied up a bit with a lot of self-congratulatory descriptions of how HARD she had to try to talk to the family and how MANY times she called asking for interviews. At times I felt like she badgered them worse than the unethical people who had come before.The sadness of this story is really about the devastation of a family when its unifying force, a strong mother, is removed. Piled on with more sadness about the appalling institutional conditions for mentally handicapped patients (talking about Henrietta Lacks' oldest daughter) back in the 50's and you have tragedy on top of more tragedy."
160,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,4,"This is a very powerful and informative story. Also, with the history of personal freedoms, civil rights, and right to privacy/requiring consent, this is a very important books. I am not sure the details about the science involved in the story will appeal to all. Just the same as how those who are here for the science may be disinterested in the background stories of the people involved. But, if you think you will like one of the other, I don’t think the one you don’t care for will be distracting.With that in mind, I will continue with the statement that it really is two books: the science and the people. First, the background of cell and tissue research in the last 100 years is intriguing and to hear about all of the advances and why Henretta Lacks was key to them is fascinating. Second, the background of not only the Lacks family, but also others who have had their tissues/cells used for research without permission, gives a lot of food for thought. Almost every medical advancement, and many scientific advancements, in the past 60 years are because of Henrietta Lacks. But, questions about the consent she gave, what she understood about her cells being used, and how much the family has benefited are all questioned and discussed. It really hits hard to think that you may have no control over parts of you once they are no longer part of your body. Also, the fiscal and research ramifications of giving people more rights over their body tissue/cells really creates a huge Catch-22. As I had surgery earlier this year that involved some tissue being removed for analysis, it started to make me wonder what I signed on all those forms and if my cells might still be out there being used for research.The only part of the book that kind of dragged for me was the time that the author spent with the family late in the book. After listening to an interview with the author it was surprising to hear that this part of the book may have been her original focus (how the family has dealt with the revelations surrounding the use of their mother’s cells), but to me it kind of dragged and got repetitive. I don’t think it is bad and others may find it interesting, it just was what brought down my interest in the story a little bit.If you like science-based stories, medical-based stories, civil/personal rights history, and/or just love a decent non-fiction, I think this book is very worth checking out."
161,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1992225-liz-nutting,5,"When I was a graduate student in the field of Ethics, one of my favorite pedagogical strategies, as both a teacher and a student, was the case study. A good case study can make an abstract ethical issue more concrete. A really good case study can turn a deeply contentious issue into an opportunity for thoughtfulness and compassion; right and wrong (to the extent that those concepts even belong in the study of ethics) are nuanced by descriptions of circumstances or values or human need that can make it easier to see and hear and believe the ones on the other side(s) of an issue. Often the case studies are hypothetical, or descriptions of actual cases pared to ""just the facts, ma'am,"" without all the possible extenuating circumstances that can shape difficult decisions. For some students, this causes great angst. How could they be asked to make a judgment, especially one that might involve life or death, without knowing all the details? And of course, at the end of the lesson, everyone wants to know what really happened, how things turned out ""in real life."" On those rare occasions when we actually do know something of the outcome, it is clear that knowing what ""really"" happened almost never makes the decision easier, clearer, or less agonizing. And that is what makes The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks so deeply compelling and challenging. It is the rare story of the outcome of a seemingly inconsequential decision by a doctor and a researcher in 1951, one that few at that time would have ever seen as an ethical decision, let alone an unethical one. A researcher studying cell cultures needs samples; a doctor treating a woman with aggressive cervical cancer scrapes a few extra cells of that cancer into a Petri dish for the researcher. The missing cells had no bearing whatsoever on the outcome of the woman's disease, so no harm done. A few weeks later the woman is dead, but her cancer cells are living in the lab. The bare bones ethical issue at stake--whether it is ethically warranted to take a patient's tissues without consent and subsequently use them for scientific and medical research--is even now not a particularly contentious one...yet. Legally, the case law is settled: tissue removed in the course of medical treatment or testing no longer belongs to the patient. It is, in essence, refuse, and one woman's trash is another man's treasure. Ethically, almost all the professional guidelines encourage researchers to obtain consent, but they have no teeth (and most were non-existent in 1951 anyway). In reality, the vast majority of the tissue taken from patients is of limited use. But there are those rare times when a single person's cells have the potential to break open the worlds of science and medicine, to the benefit of millions--and the enrichment of a very few. Such was the case with the cells of cervical cancer taken from Henrietta Lacks at Johns Hopkins University hospital. HeLa cells grew in the lab of George Gey. And grew. And grew, unlike any cell before it. Next, they were carried to a different laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, where Jonas Salk used them to successfully test his polio vaccine, and thus the cancer that had killed Henrietta Lacks directly led to the healing of millions worldwide. Soon HeLa cells would be in almost every major research laboratory in the world. They traveled to Asia to help find a cure for hemorrhagic fever and into space to study the effects of zero gravity on human cells. Even today, almost 60 years after Henrietta's death, HeLa cells are some of the most widely used by the scientific community. With such immeasurable benefits as these, who could possibly doubt the wisdom of Henrietta's doctor to take a tiny bit of tissue? But the ""real"" story is much more complicated. Henrietta Lacks was uneducated, poor and black. Her cancer was treated in the ""colored"" ward of Johns Hopkins. Her death left five children without their mother, to be raised by an abusive cousin. Should any of that matter in weighing the morality of taking tissue from a patient without her consent, especially in light of the benefits? God knows our country's history of medical experimentation on the poor and minority populations is not pretty. Ironically, one of the laboratories researching with HeLa cells in the 1950s was the one at the Tuskegee Institute--at the very same time that the infamous syphilis studies were taking place. In light of that history, Henrietta's race and socioeconomic status can't help but be relevant factors in her particular case. But her children's status? What bearing does that have? According to author Rebecca Skloot, in ethical discussions of the use of human tissue, ""[t]here are, essentially, two issues to deal with: consent and money."" Both become issues for Henrietta's children. The family didn't learn until 1973 that their mother's cells had been taken, or that they'd played such a vital role in the development of scientific knowledge. They spent the next 30 years trying to learn more about their mother's cells. As they learned of the money made by the pharmaceutical companies and other companies as a direct result of HeLa cells, they inevitably asked questions about what share, if any, they were entitled to. As Henrietta's eldest son put it, ""If our mother so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?"" But even more than financial compensation, the family wants recognition--and respect--for their mother. They want the woman behind her contributions acknowledged for who she is--a black woman, a mother, a person with name longer than four letters. And they want to know the mother they never knew, to find out the facts of her death. In the lab at Johns Hopkins, looking through a microscope at her mother's cells for the first time, daughter Deborah sums it up: ""John Hopkin [sic] is a school for learning, and that's important. But this is my mother. Nobody seem to get that."" Would a fully informed Henrietta Lacks have made the decision to give her tissue to George Gey if asked? Would her decision either way have had any affect whatsoever on her children's future lives? We'll never know, of course. But reading the story behind the case study makes these questions far more potent than any ethics textbook can. And as science now unravels the strains of our DNA--thanks in no small part to HeLa--these are no longer inconsequential questions for any of us. Perhaps we, too, like the doctors and scientists who have long studied HeLa, can learn from the case study of Henrietta Lacks. "
162,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-bionic-jean,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is is an extraordinary book. By turns it is shocking, informative and tragic. There is brilliance - but also deep injustice. It is in part an account of the development of genetics, part social commentary, and partly the story of one woman, Henrietta Lacks. She was an African-American woman descended from slaves and one white slave-owner (Lacks), and she lived as many hundreds of black people still did even as late as the 1950's, in poverty in an old slave-cabin - the ""home-house"" - in East Baltimore. And although the events do not always make for easy reading, the author assures us that it is completely non-fiction. Nothing has been invented, nothing exaggerated. The author has done her level best to tell things as they were. Although the name ""Henrietta Lacks"" is comparatively unknown, ""HeLa"" cells are routinely used in scientific experiments worldwide today, and have been for decades. They are the only human cells thought to be scientifically ""immortal"" ie if they are provided with the correct culture and environment they do not die. They were cut from a tumour in the cervix of Henrietta Lacks a few months before she died in 1951; extracted because she had a particular virulent form of cancer. Despite extreme measures taken in the laboratories to protect the cells, human cells had always inevitably died after a few days. HeLa cells though, stayed alive in the petri dish, and proved to be virtually unstoppable, growing faster and stronger than any other cells known.These HeLa cells were used to develop the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilisation and a host of other medical treatments. They were sent on the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity. It is fair to say that they have helped with some of the most important advances in medicine. But there is a terrible irony and injustice in this. The people to benefit from this were largely white people. Henrietta Lacks's family and descendants suffered appalling poverty. Working from dawn to dusk in poisonous tobacco fields was the norm as soon as the children were able to stand. Moving from Virginia's tobacco production to Bethlehem Steel, a boiler manufacturer in South Boston, was little better, as they were then exposed to asbestos and coal. The families had intermingled for generations. Henrietta and Day, her husband, were first cousins, and this was by no means unusual. So the predisposition to illness was both hereditary and environmental. But access to medical help was virtually nil. Most hospitals accepted only whites, or grudgingly admitted so-called ""colored"" people to a separate area, which was far less well funded and staffed. The Lacks family had to travel a long way in order to be treated, and then were not allowed the privilege of proper explanations as to the treatment given - or the tissue samples extracted.At this time unusual cells were taken routinely by doctors wanting to make their own investigations into cancer (which at that time was thought to be a virus) and many other conditions. No permission was sought; none was needed. The Hippocratic oath doctors set such store by dates from the 4th Century BC, and makes no mention of it; neither did the law of the time require it. It was not until 1947, that the subject was raised. Nazi doctors had performed many ethically unsound operations and experiments on live Jews, and during the trials after the war the Nuremberg Code - a 10 point code of ethics - was set up. This states that, ""The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential."" Even then it was advice, not law. Rebecca Skloot says that Howard Jones, the doctor who had originally diagnosed Henrietta Lacks' cancer, said, ""Hopkins, with its large indigent black population, had no dearth of clinical material."" It was clearly a racial norm of the time. In fact to be fair, the white doctors had no real conception that what they were doing had an ethical side. George Gey and his assistants were responsible for isolating the genetic material in Henrietta's cells - an astonishing feat. Gey happily shared the cells with any scientists who asked. The issue of payment was never raised, but the HeLa cells fast became a commodity, and the Lacks's family, who were never consulted about anything, mistakenly assumed until very recently that Gey must have made a fortune out of them. As Henrietta's daughter Deborah said, ""Them white folks getting rich of our mother while we got nothin."" Skloot carefully chronicles some of the most shocking medical stories from these times. The reader infers from her examples that testing on the impoverished and disadvantaged was almost routine. One notorious study was into syphilis and apparently went on for 40 years. It was called the ""Tuskegee study"", and involved thousands of males at varying stages of the disease. At the time it was known that they could be cured by penicillin, but they were not given this treatment, in order that doctors could study the progress of the disease. In this case they were volunteers, but were encouraged by the offer of free travel to the hospital, a free meal when they got there, and the promise of $50 for their families after they died, for funeral expenses. There are many such poignant examples. The author also says that in 1954 thousands of chronically ill elderly people, convicts and even some children, were injected by a Dr. Chester Southam with HeLa cells, basically just to see what would happen. Of course many of them went on to develop cancer. One man who had Hela cells injected in his arm produced small tumours there within days. But the patients were never informed of this, and if they did happen to ask were told they were being ""tested for immunity"". (We are told that Southam was prosecuted for this much later in 1966.) It was not until 1957 that there was any mention in law of ""informed consent."" Confidentially and privacy violation issues came far later.After her death, four of Henrietta Lacks's children, Lawrence, Deborah, Sonny and Joe, were put in the charge of Ethel, a friend of the family who had been very envious of Henrietta. It appears that she was incredibly cruel to the children, hardly ever feeding them until late, after a day's work, when they would be given a meagre crust. She would also drag the youngest one, Joe, out of bed at will, and beat him unmercifully. Joe was only 4 months old when his mother died and grew up to have severe behavioural problems. In fact later on on life, all these children grew to have not only health problems (including all being almost deaf) but a myriad of social problems too - being involved in burglary, assault and drugs - and spent a lot of their lives in prison.One of Henrietta's five children had been put in ""Crownsville Hospital for the Negro Insane"" when she was still tiny, because Henrietta was too ill to care for her any more. The story of this child, which is gradually told through Skloot's text as more of it is revealed, is heart-breaking. It is not clear why Elsie was so slow, but her mental retardation is now thought to be partly due to syphilis, and partly due to being born on the home-house stone floor - which was routine for such families at the time - and banging her head during birth. It was not known what had subsequently happened to Elsie until Skloot's research, but then some records were discovered. A photograph of Elsie shows a miserable child apparently in pain in a distorted position. Apparently brain scans then necessitated draining the surrounding brain fluid. Never mind that the patient might then suffer violent headaches, fits and vomiting for 2-3 months until the fluid reformed; it gave a better picture. Many people had been sent to this institution because of ""idiocy"" or epilepsy; the assumption now is that that they were incarcerated to get them out of the way, and that tests like this, often for research, were routine. Figures from 1955, when Elsie died, showed that at that time the hospital had 2700 patients, which was 800 over the maximum capacity. The ratio of doctors to patients was 1 doctor for 225 patients.Add into this the appalling inhumanity of history where white people used black people for their own ends, and the fears of Henrietta's family and community become inevitable. There had been stories for generations of white-coated doctors coming at dead of night and experimenting on black people. This became confused - or perhaps vindicated - by the Ku Klux Klan. Stories of voodoo, charismatic religious experiences, dire poverty, lack of basic education (one of Henrietta's brothers was more fortunate in that he had 4 years' schooling in total) untreated health problems and the prevailing 1950's attitudes of never questioning the doctor, all fed into the mix resulting in ignorance and occasional hysteria.Much of the first part of this book includes descriptions of scientific research and discoveries; both the theory and practise of how genes were isolated. Alternating with this is the background to the racial tensions, and the history of Henrietta Lacks' ancestry and family. Rebecca Skloot, a science writer, had been fascinated by the potential story since school days, when she first heard of HeLa cells, but nobody seemed to know anything about them. She started this book in her 20's, and spent a decade researching it, financed by credit cards and student loans. As a white woman she was treated with gross suspicion by all Henrietta Lacks's family. Eventually she formed a good relationship with Deborah, but it took a year before Deborah would even speak to her, and Deborah's brothers were very resistant. Several of them were pastors, as was James Pullam, her husband. They believed the Bible literally and had many fears about how Henrietta's cells were used. Deborah herself could not understand how they were immortal. Could her mother's cells feel pain when they were exploded, or infected? Would they develop into half-human half-chicken freaks when they were split and combined with chicken cells? Were there millions of clones all looking like her mother wandering around London? The media worldwide had played its part in adding to these fears, which had been spawned by a genuine ignorance.The interviews with Henrietta's family, and the progress and discoveries Skloot made accompanied by Deborah in the second part of the book, do make the reader uneasy. Indeed parts of these passages read like a trashy novel. Skloot says she wanted to report the conversation verbatim, so the vernacular is reported intact. Fair enough. But there is a lot of, ""Deborah shouted"" or, ""Lawrence yelled"". Of course they did! All of Henrietta's children had severe health problems, probably due to a variety of factors; their environment, upbringing and genetic inheritance. They were all very hard of hearing, so yes, they would shout when amongst themselves. Add to this Skloot's tendency to describe the attributes and appearance of a family member as ""beautiful hazel-nut brown skin"" or ""twinkling eyes"" and there is a whiff of condescension which does not sit well. Does it add anything to this account? Would a description of the author as having ""raven-black hair and full glossy lips"" help? Of course not. The author may feel she is being complimentary; she is not. She is being patronising. But it is difficult to know how else the total incomprehension and ignorance of how a largely white society operated could have been conveyed, other than by this verbatim reportage, even though at worst it comes across as extremely crass, and at best gently humorous.It would be convenient to imagine that these appalling cases were a thing of the past. But the book continues detailing injustices until the date of its publication in 2010. Henrietta's son, Sonny had a quintuple bypass in 2003. Skloot reports, ""The last thing he remembered before falling unconscious under the anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened in medicine."" So far, so good. There was recognition. But Skloot then delivers the final shot, ""Sonny woke up more than $125,500 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery."" As Lawrence (Henrietta's eldest son) says elsewhere, ""It's not fair! She's the most important person in the world and her family [are] living in poverty. If our mother [is] so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""Henrietta's original cancer had in fact been misdiagnosed. It was discovered years later that because she had syphilis, she had the genital warts HPV virus, which does actually invade the DNA. There is an intriguing section on this, as well as the ""HeLa bomb"", where one doctor painstakingly proved to the whole of the scientific community that a lot of their research had been flawed, as HeLa cells were contaminating many of the other cells they had been working with and drawing conclusions from. They were so virulent that they could travel on the smallest particle of dust in the atmosphere, and because Gey had given them so generously, there was no real record of where they had all ended up.Deborah herself always lived in fear of inheriting her mother's cancer. Because of this she readily submitted to tests. Victor McKusick took blood samples, which Deborah believed were for ""cancer tests."" In fact though, Skloot claims, they were for his own research. This is another example of chronic misunderstanding. He knew of the family's mental anguish and the unfair treatment they had had. He thought she understood why he wanted the blood. He gave her an autographed copy of his book - a technical manual on Genetics. Of this, Deborah commented wryly, ""It would have been nice if he'd told me what the damn thing said too."" And again, ""I would like some health insurance so I don't got to pay all that money every month for drugs my mother cells probably helped to make.""In 2001, Skloot tells us, Christoph Lengauer, now the Head of Oncology in one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, said of Henrietta, ""Her cells are how it all started."" And to Deborah, ""Once there is a cure for cancer, it's definitely largely because of your mother's cells.""In 2005 the US government issued gene patents relating to the use of 20% of known human genes, including Alzheimer's, asthma, colon cancer and breast cancer. The injustices however, continue. Pharmaceutical companies, scientists and universities now control what research is done, and the costs of the resulting tests and therapies. An example of how this continues to impede scientific development according to the author is that of the company Myriad Genetics, who hold the patent on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. (These are the genes which are responsible for most hereditary breast cancers.) The company had arbitrarily set a charge of $3000 to have this test, amid furore amongst scientists. They had licensed the use of the test. Anyone who ignored it received a threat of litigation. Eventually in 2009 they were sued by the American Civil Liberties Union, representing a huge number of people including 150,000 scientists for inhibiting research. The commercialisation of human biological materials has now become big business.There seems to have been some attempts at restitution since this book was published, the most recent being in August 2013. There was an agreement between the family and The National Institutes of Health to give the family some control over the access to the cells' DNA code, and a promise of acknowledgement on scientific papers. The committee set to oversee this arrangement will have 6 members, 2 of whom will be members of the family. The wheels have been set in motion.All in all this is an important and startlingly original book by a dedicated and compassionate author. It speaks to every one of us, regardless of our colour, nationality or class. Skloot admitted that it took a long time to decide the structure of the book, in order to include all the important aspects that she wished to. There are three sections: ""Life"", ""Death"" and ""Immortality"", plus an ""Afterword"". The main thrust throughout is clearly the enduring injustice the Lacks family suffered. So perhaps the final words should be Joe's, or (as he changed his name when he converted to Islam in prison), Zakariyya's: ""I believe what them doctors did was wrong. They lied to us for 25 years, kept them cells from us, then they gonna say them things DONATED by our mother. Them cells was stolen! Those fools come take blood from us sayin they need to run tests and not tell us that all these years they done profitized off of her…. You don't lie and clone behind their backs. That's wrong - it's one of the most violating parts of this whole thing….Then doctors say her cells [are] so important and did all this and that to help people. But it didn't do no good for her, and it don't do no good for us. If me and my sister need something, we can't even go and see a doctor cause we can't afford it.""It's too late for some of Henrietta's family. For how many others will it also be too late?"

Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, ""Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."" (Matthew 26:26-28, NIV Bible)From The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks: There's no way of knowing how many of Henrietta's cells are alive today. One scientist estimates that if you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown on a scale, they'd weigh more than 50 million metric tons--an inconceivable number, given that an individual cell weighs almost nothing....Her cells were part of research into the genes that cause cancer and those that suppress it; they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, and Parkinson's disease; and they've been used to study lactose digestion, sexually transmitted diseases, appendicitis, human longevity, mosquito mating, and the negative cellular effects of working in sewers....Like guinea pigs and mice, Henrietta's cells have become the standard laboratory workhorse.(The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, pp. 2-4)Questions:1) Assuming Jesus Christ was speaking literally, please calculate the total mass and volume of the Body of Christ consumed in the period between the Last Supper (c. 30-36 AD/CE) and the present day.

But what happens when her biological material generates billions of dollars for the drug and pharmaceutical industry, leaving her dirt poor descendants in the lurch?Yeah, I know I wrote that like the teaser for one of my mysteries but the only mystery here is how people who have profited from the diseased cells that killed a woman can sleep at night while her kids and grand kids don't have two nickels to rub together.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is really two stories. One of Henrietta Lacks and her cancer cells that lived decades beyond her years, and the other of Rebecca Skloot and the surviving members of the Lacks family.Henrietta Lacks married her counsin, contracted multiple STD's due to his philandering ways, and died of misdiagnosed cervical cancer by the time she was 30. However, the cancer that killed her survives today in the form of HeLa cells, which have been taken to the moon, exposed to every manner of radiation and illness, and all sorts of other experiments. While other people are raking in money due to the HeLa research, the surviving Lacks family doesn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of, bringing me to the real meat of the book: The pharmaceutical industry is a bunch of dickbags. Imagine having something removed that generated billions of dollars of revenue for people you've never met and still needing to watch your budget so you can pay your mortage. Fair? Shit no, but that's the way it is, apparently. It also seems illogical that you can patent things you didn't create but again, that's the way the cookie crumbles.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an eye-opening look at someone most of us have never heard of but probably owe some sort of debt to. Also, it drags the big money pharma companies out in the sun. Sadly, they do not burst into flames like the vampires they are. Four out of five stars. I'm going to go read something happy now."
165,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,5,"The gift of life is surely the greatest gift of all. So how can the story of the remarkable woman who gave that gift over and over again to millions of people have been overlooked for so long?In 1951 a poor African American woman in Maryland became an uninformed donor to medical science. Henrietta Lacks died at age 31 of cervical cancer at John Hopkins hospital in Baltimore. Then doctors discovered that tumor cells they had removed from her body earlier continued to thrive in the lab - a medical first.Before long, her cells, dubbed HeLa cells, would be used for research around the world, contributing to major advances in everything from cancer treatments to vaccines; from aging to the life cycle of mosquitoes; nuclear bomb explosions to effect of gravity on human tissue during flights to outer space. An estimated 50 million metric tons of her cells were reproduced; thousands of careers have been build, and initiated more than 60 000 scientific studies until now, but Henrietta Lacks never gave permission for that research, nor had her family.In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca Skloot gracefully tells the story of the real woman and her descendants; the history of race-related medical research, including the role of eugenics; the struggles of the Lacks family with poverty, politics and racial issues; the phenomenal development of science based on the HeLa cells, in a language that can be understood by everyone. She combined the family's story with the changing ethics and laws around tissue collection, the irresponsible use of the family's medical information by journalists and researchers and the legislation preventing the family from benefiting from it all.COMMENTSI was gifted this book in December but never realized the impact it had internationally, neither would have on me. Until I finished reading it last night, I did not know it was an international bestseller, as well as read by so many of my GR friends! It was total surprise, since nonfiction is normally not a regular star on bestseller lists, right?The debate around the moral issue, and the experiences of the poor family were very well presented in the book, which was truly well written and objective as far as possible. For me personally, the question of how this woman, who basically saved millions of people's lives, were overlooked, is answered in the arrogance of scientists who deemed it unnecessary to respect the rights of people unable to fend for themselves.The ethical and moral dilemmas it created in America, when the family became aware of their mother's contribution to science without anyone's knowledge or consent, just enabled the commercial enterprises who benefited massively from her cells, to move to other countries where human rights are just a faint star in a unlimited universe. The Lacks family drew a line in the sand of how far people must be exploited in America. Unfortunately the medical fraternity just moved their operations elsewhere.Tissue and organ harvesting thrive in the world, it is globally a massive industry, with the poorest of the poor still the uninformed donors. An open secret. There are numerous stories, especially in India, where people wake up and realize they were operated on and one of their organs is missing. Stolen. By the time they became aware of it, the organ had already been transplanted in America and elsewhere in the world. That's no secret. Everything is justified as long as science is involved.  Nowadays people in other parts of the world sell their organs, even though it is illegal in most countries. According to American laws people cannot sell their tissue, which is part of human organs? People can donate it though, then it is acceptable.Yet someone else can patent your cells, but you're not allowed to be compensated, since the minute it leaves your body, it is regarded as waste, disposed of, and therefor not deemed your 'property' anymore. Huh?This book was a good and necessary read. The human interest side of it, telling the story of the family was eye-opening and excellent. A little bit of melodramatic, but how else would it become a bestseller, if ordinary readers like us could not relate to it. It was very well-written indeed. Thanks to Rebecca Skloot, in 2010, sixty years later, HeLa now has a history, a face and an address. Finally, Henrietta Lacks, and not the anonymous HeLa, became a biological celebrity. In 1951 Dr. Grey's lab assistant handled yet just another tissue sample of hundreds, when she received Henrietta's to prepare for research. She named it HeLa(first two letters of the patient's name and last name). But a few months later she visited the body of the deceased Henrietta Lacks in the mortuary to collect more samples. When she saw the woman's red-painted toenails, a lightbulb went on.Mary Kubicek: “Oh jeez, she’s a real person. . . . I started imagining her sitting in her bathroom painting those toenails, and it hit me for the first time that those cells we’d been working with all this time and sending all over the world, they came from a live woman. I’d never thought of it that way.”John Hopkins hospital could have considered naming a wing of their research facilities after Henrietta Lack. Why don't they?Nevertheless, this book should be read by everybody. Without it the world would have been a lot poorer and less human.The world has a lot to answer for.RECOMMENDED for sure!EDIT I googled the Lacks family and landed upon the website of the Lacks Foundation, which was started by Rebecca Skloot. http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/That news TOTALLY made my day. I wish them all the best and hope they will succeed in their goals and dreams. A wonderful initiative. Just imagine what can be accomplished if every single person, organization, research facility and medical company who benefitted for Henrietta Lacks's tissue cells, donate only $1 (one single dollar)? Yes, just imagine that!So many positive things happened to the family after the book was published. It just brings tears of joy to my eyes.http://www.lacksfamily.net/index.phpAnd finally: May 29, 2010A Historic Day: Henrietta Lacks’s Long Unmarked Grave Finally Gets a Headstonethanks to Dr. Roland Pattillo at Morehouse School of Medicine, who donated a headstone after reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks."

Or, as is the case hear, having learned so much about which I knew nothing. My jaw is still on the floor after I finished this book and I can only imagine the controversies and discussions it might provoke. A thank you goes out to three Goodreads friends who recommended that I read this book and open an avenue for discussion. Aven, Brenda, and Rae, I hope we can begin a wild and intriguing dialogue, pulling others into the mix as things gain momentum.Who was Henrietta Lacks? What are HeLa cells? These are two of the foundational questions that Rebecca Skloot sought to answer in this poignant biographical piece. While I have tackled a number of biographies in my time as a reader, Skloot offered a unique approach to the genre in publication. Henrietta Lacks grew up in rural Virginia, picking tobacco and made ends meet as best she could. After marrying, she had a brood of children, including two of note, Elsie and Deborah, whose significance becomes apparent as the reader delves deeper into the narrative. Skloot offered up a succinct, but detailed narrative of how Lacks found an unusual mass inside her and was sent from her doctor to a specialist at Johns Hopkins (yes, THAT medical centre) for treatment. The mass was malignant and Lacks was deemed to have cervical cancer. Her surgeon, following the precedent of many doctors in the early 1950s, took samples of her tumour as well as that of the healthy part of her cervix, hoping to be able to have the cells survive so they could be analysed. Past attempts by doctors and scientists failed to keep cells alive for very long, which led to the constant slicing and saving technique used by those in the medical profession, when the opportunity arose. As it turns out, Lacks' cells were not only fascinating to explore, but George Gey (Head of Tissue Culture Research at Johns Hopkins) noticed that they lasted indefinitely, as long as they were properly fed. Gey realised that he had something on his hands and tried to get approval from the Lacks family, though did so in an extremely opaque manner. After Lacks succumbed to the cancer, doctors sought to perform an autopsy, which might allow them complete access to Lacks' body. Ignorant of what was going on, Henrietta's husband agreed, thinking that this was only to ensure his children and subsequent generations would not suffer the agony that cancer brought upon Henrietta. So began the conniving and secretive nature of George Gey. He harvested these 'special cells' and named them ""HeLa"", a brief combination of the original patient's two names. Their phenomenal growth and sustainability led him to ship them all over the country and eventually the world, though the Lacks family had no idea this was going on. HeLa cells were studied to create a polio vaccine (Jonas Salk used them at the University of Pittsburgh), helped to better understand cellular reactions to nuclear testing, space travel, and introduction of cancer cells into an otherwise healthy body during curious and somewhat inhumane tests on Ohio inmates. During all this, Johns Hopkins remained completely aware of what was going on and the transmission of HeLa cells around the globe, though did not think to inform the Lacks family, perhaps for fear that they would halt the use of these HeLa cells. Through the use of the term 'HeLa' cells, no one was the wiser and no direct acknowledgement of the long-deceased Henrietta Lacks need be made. Skloot provided much discussion about the uses, selling, 'donating', and experimenting that took place, including segments of the scientific community in America that were knowingly in violation of the Nuremberg Rules on human experimentation, though they danced their own legal jig to get around it all. The crux of the biography lay on this conundrum, though it would only find its true impact by exploring the lives of those Henrietta Lacks left behind after her death.Skloot took the time to pepper chapters with the history of the Lacks family as they grew up and, eventually, what happened when they were made aware that the HeLa cells existed, over two decades after they were obtained and Henrietta had died. Skloot split this other biographical piece into two parts, which eventually merge into one, documenting her research trips and interviews with the family alongside the presentation of a narrative that explores the fruits of those sit-down interviews. That Skloot tried to remain somewhat neutral is apparent, though through her connection to Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah, there was an obvious bias that developed. Superimposing these two narratives would, hopefully, offer the reader a chance to feel a personal connection to the Lacks family and the struggles they went through. In her discussions of the Lacks family, Skloot pulled no punches and presented the raw truths of criminal activity, abuse, addiction, and poverty alongside happy gatherings and memories of Henrietta. No biographical piece would be complete if it were only window dressing and trying to paint a rosy picture of this maligned family without offering at least a little peek into their daily lives. However, it balanced out and Skloot ended up with what the reader might call a decent introduction to this run of the mill family unit. Their ire at being duped by Johns Hopkins was apparent, alongside the dichotomy that HeLa cells were so popular, yet the family remained in dire poverty in the poor areas of Baltimore.The legal ramifications of HeLa cell usage was discussed at various points in the book, though there was no firm case related to it, at least not one including the Lacks family. One person I know sought to draw parallels between the Lacks situation and that of Carrie Buck, as illustrated wonderfully in Adam Cohen's book, Imbeciles (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...). While the courts surely fell short in codifying ownership of cells and research done on them, the focus of Skloot's book was the social injustice by Johns Hopkins, not the ineptitude of the US Supreme Court, as Cohen showed while presenting Buck v. Bell to the curious audience. While George Gey vowed that he gave away the HeLa cell samples to anyone who wanted them, surely the chain reaction and selling of them in catalogues thereafter allowed someone to line their pockets. Skloot offers up numerous mentions from the family, usually through Deborah, that the Lacks family was not seeking to get rich off of this discovery of immortal cells. While companies were spending millions and profiting billions from the early testing of HeLa cells, no one in the family could afford to see a doctor or purchase the medicines they needed (all of which came about because of tests HeLa cells facilitated!). It is both fascinating and angering to see the system wash their hands of the guilt related to immoral collecting and culturing of these HeLa cells. Skloot did explore the slippery slope of cells and tissue as discarded waste, as well as the need for consent in testing them, something the reader ought to spend some time exploring once the biographical narrative ends. It is sure to confound and confuse even the most well-grounded reader.The latter chapters touched upon the aptly used word from the title ""Immortal"" as it relates to Henrietta Lacks. Be it a biography that placed a story behind the woman, a detailed discussion of how the HeLa cell came into being and how its presence is all over the medical world, or that medical advancements as we know them will allow Henrietta Lacks' being to live on for eternity, the reader can reflect on which rationale best suits them. While there is a religious undertone in the biography as it relates to this, Christianity is not inculcated into the reader's mind, as it was not when Skloot learned about these things.Do I know Henrietta Lacks any better now, after Skloot completed her work? Most definitely! Can I, a complete scientific dunce, better understand HeLa cells and the idea behind cell growth and development? Completely! Do I feel there was an injustice done to the Lacks family by Johns Hopkins in 1951 and for decades to come? Yes, I do harbour a strong resentment to the duplicitous attitude undertaken by a hospital whose founder sought to ensure those who could not receive medical care on their own be helped and protected. Is there a lingering legal argument to be made for compensatory damages or at least some fiduciary responsibility owed to the Lacks family? That is a very grey area for me, only further complicated by the legal discussions in the Afterward and the advancement of new and complicated scientific discoveries, which also bore convoluted legal arguments. I will say this... Skloot brought Henrietta Lacks to life and if that puts a face to those HeLa cells, perhaps all those who read this book will think twice about those medicines used in their bodies and the scientific breakthroughs that are attributed to many powerful companies and/or nations. Maybe then, Henrietta can live on in all of us, immortal in some form or another.Kudos, Madam Skloot for intriguing someone whose scientific background is almost nil. You brought numerous stories to life and helped me see just how powerful one woman can be, silenced by death and the ignorance of what those around her were doing.Like/hate the review?

167,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol,4,"This 2010 work of non-fiction regarding THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS is a sad story and a tough, draining read that shocked me more than once along the way.Henrietta was a poor black woman only 31 years of age when she died of cervical cancer leaving five children behind, her youngest, Deborah, just a baby. Her story is a heartbreaking one, but also an important one as her cancer cells, forever to be known as HeLa taken without her consent or knowledge, saved thousands of lives.Through ten long years of investigative work by this author, this narrative explores the experimental, racial and ethical issues of HeLa (the cells that would not die), while intertwining the story of her children's lives and the utter shock of finding out about their mother's cells more than twenty years later.""Physician Seeks Volunteers For Cancer Research."" Yeah, right........So many parts of this book made me sick to my stomach.....like the uncaring treatment of animals and all the poor souls injected with cancer cells without their knowledge in the name of research and greed; and oh, dam Ethel for the inhumane and brutal abuse to Henrietta's children too. Unbelievable!Whew! I must admit to being glad when I turned the last page on this one, but big time kudos to Rebecca Skloot for researching and telling Henrietta's story. She deserved so much better."
168,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,4,"Overall, a four star read that should probably be required reading for both biology and American history classes. (Actually, it was a far more interesting read than that makes it sound). While I had heard a great deal of buzz on the book, I wasn't prepared for how the story evolved. The book alternates between Henrietta Lacks' personal history, that of her family, a little of medical history and Skoot's actual pursuit of the story, which helps develop the story in historical context. Skoots included a lot more science than I expected, and even with ten years in the medical field, I was horrified at times. Skoots does a decent job of maintaining a journalistic tone, but some of the things she relates are terrible, from the way Henrietta grew up to cervical cancer treatment in the 50s and 60s. These were the days before cancer treatments approached the precision medicine it is aiming for today, and the treatments resembled nothing so much as trying to cut fingernails with garden shears. Just the thought of a radioactive seed tucked in the uterus causing tissue burn was enough to give me sympathetic cramps.Part of the evil in the book is the violence her family inflicted on each other, and it's one of the truly uncomfortable areas. I think that discomfort is important, because part of where this story comes from has to do with slavery and poverty. There isn't really an ethical high ground here, and that's part of Skoot's skill in setting up the story, and part of the problem in being a white woman telling the story of a black woman. The only reason I didn't give this a five star rating is that the narrative started to fall apart at the end, leaving behind the stories of the cell line and focus more on the breakdown of Henrietta's daughter, Deborah. While I understand she is the touchstone for the story, that she is partly telling the story of the mother through the daughter, much of Henrietta and the science is sidelined.Interesting questions popped up while reading; namely, why does everyone equate Henrietta's cancer cells with her person? As an illustration, if you tell people they have a cancerous tumor, the reaction is ""get rid of it."" It is categorized as ""other"" in everyone's mind and not recognized it as an intrinsic part of the person with cancer. It is not ""them."" Biologically speaking, I'm not sure the book answered the question of whether of not the HeLa cells actually were genetically identical to Henrietta, or if they were mutated--altered DNA. While that might be cold comfort, it's a huge philosophical and scientific question that is the pivot point for a number of issues. Treating the cells as if they were ""normal"" is part of what lead the scientists into disaster as evidenced by the discovery that so many cell lines were HeLa contaminated (I don't believe that transmission mechanism was explained either, which irks me). It also could be the basis for a sophisticated legal and ethical argument."

Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead in 1951. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سی و یکم ماه آگوست سال 2014 میلادیعنوان: حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس؛ نویسنده: ربکا اسکلاوت (اسکلوت)؛ مترجم: حسین راسی؛ تهران آرامش‏‫، 1390؛ در 426ص؛ شابک 9789649219165؛ موضوع: هنرییتا لکس از سال 1920م تا 1951م؛ بیماران و سرطان - اخلاق پزشکی - کشت یاخته ها - آزمایش روی انسان - سده 21م‬زندگینامه ی بیماری به نام «هنرییتا لکس» است، نامش «هنریتا لکس» بود، اما دانشمندان ایشان را با نام «هلا» میشناسند؛ یک کشاورز تنباکوی فقیر جنوب بود، که در همان سرزمین اجداد برده ی خود، کار میکردند، اما سلولهایش - که بدون آگاهی ایشان گرفته شده - به یکی از مهمترین ابزارهای پزشکی تبدیل شد؛ نخستین سلولهای «جاودانه»ی انسانی که، رشد یافته اند، و امروز هنوز هم زنده هستند، اگرچه ایشان در سال 1951میلادی درگذشته اند؛ اگر بتوانیم همه ی سلولهای «هلا» را که تکثیر شده اند، وزن کنیم، شاید وزن آنها به بیش از پنجاه میلیون تن برسد؛ سلولهای «هلا» برای ایجاد «واکسن فلج اطفال» حیاتی بودند؛ سلولهای ایشان، پرده از اسرار «سرطان»، «ویروسها» و اثرات «تشعشعات بمب اتم»؛ برداشتند؛ همچنین پیشرفتهایی همانند: «لقاح آزمایشگاهی»، «کلونینگ» و «نقشه برداری ژن»، یاری کرده است؛ و توسط میلیاردها انسان خریداری و فروخته شده اند؛ با اینحال «هنریتتا لکس» ناشناخته مانده، و در یک گور نامشخص دفن شده استاین کتاب به بخش‌های: برخورد اخلاق در حرفه پزشکی با نژادپرستی، و محرومیت‌های «تاریخی- اجتماعی» رنگین پوستان، برخورد جنبه‌ های معنوی، و حقوقی مالکیت بافت‌های بدن انسان، به تنگدستی و خرافات‌، و برخورد با اکتشاف‌ها، راهکارها، و شیوه ‌های نوین پزشکی هم پرداخته، و نکاتی خواندنی را پیش روی خوانشگر میگذارد؛ «حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس»: صحبت‌ها، یادمانهای نزدیکان «لکس»، و نگاهی به اسناد قانونی، و پرونده‌های پزشکی ایشان نیز هست؛ نگارنده، در این نوشتار علاوه بر نگارش تاریخچة زندگی «هنریتیا لکس» به معرفی «سلول‌های هیلا» و پاسخ‌گویی به پرسش‌‌هایی درباره ی دانش پزشکی، اخلاق، نژاد، و طبقه‌ بندی اجتماعی نیز، پرداخته استا. شربیانی"
170,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6050722-rachel,5,"Full disclosure: I come to this book from a weirdly fortuitous place. Take my brief, but mind-searing, stint in gynecologic oncology research ca. 2002, which involved a weekly trek to the OR to pick up still-warm tumors, with the women who informedly consented to donate them often open on the table as I did so. Then throw in two years working in a tissue culture hood, two more in a narrative nonfiction book group, and another big chunk of time studying infectious diseases. Mix in interests in social justice, bioethics, the history of science, and mysteries, and you’ve got me primed for some outsized adoration of Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, because its three main narratives are: 1) The history of tissue culture, particularly the contribution of the “immortal,” fabulously prolific HeLa cells that revolutionized medical research.2) The life, disease and death of Henrietta Lacks, the woman whose cervical cancer cells gave rise to the HeLa cell line.3) The story of Henrietta Lacks’s impoverished family, particularly her daughter Deborah, belatedly discovering and coping with their mother’s cellular legacy.Intertwined with all three is the concept of informed consent in scientific research, and who owns those bits of us and our genetic information that are floating around the research world. See? That perfect scientific/bioethical/historical mystery doesn’t come along every day. My expectations for this one were absolutely sky-high. And Rebecca Skloot hit it higher than that pile of 89 zillion HeLa cells. Thing is, my particular background can make reading about science kind of painfully bifurcated. I mean first, you’ve got your books that are all, “Yay! Science is totally objective and awesome and will solve all of our problems, so just shut up and trust it already!!” But then you’ve definitely also got your, “Science is just one (over-privileged and socially influenced) way of knowing among many / Medicine is patriarchal and wicked and economically motivated and pretty much out to get you, so avoid it at all costs” books too.Yes, Skloot could have written the story of a poor, black, female victim of evil white scientists. But she didn’t do that. Given her interests, it’s conceivable she could have written the triumphant history of tissue culture, and the amazing medical breakthroughs made possible by HeLa cells, and thank you for playing, poorblackwomanwhomnobodyknows. But she didn’t do that either. Instead, she spent ten years researching and writing a balanced, multifaceted book about the humans doing the science, the human whose cells made the science possible, and the humans profoundly affected by the actions of both. Her book is a complex tangle of race, class, gender and medicine. Of reason and faith. Of knowledge and ethics. Of the chasm between the beneficiaries of medical innovation and those without healthcare in the good old US of A.And Skloot doesn’t have the answers. We don’t get to tut-tut at how much things sucked in the past, while patting ourselves on the back for living in the enlightened present. This is vital and messy stuff, here. The problems haven’t been fixed. Who owns our pieces is an issue that is very much alive, and, with the current onslaught of new genetic information, becoming livelier by the minute. Which is why I would feel comfortable recommending this book to anyone involved in human-subjects research in any capacity...so a boatload of us, really, whether we know it or not.But, buyer beware: to tackle all this three-pronged complexity, Skloot uses a decidedly non-linear structure, one with a high narrative leaps:book length ratio. The three main narratives unfold together and inform each other: we meet Deborah Lacks, while learning about the fate of her mother, while learning about what HeLa cells can do, while learning about tissue culture innovators, while learning about the fate of Deborah Lacks. And Skloot saves the nuts and bolts of informed consent and the ownership of biological materials for a densely packed Afterward. Me, I found this to be a powerful structure and ate it all up with a spoon, but I can see how it could be a bit frustrating. You should also know that Skloot is in the book. According to Skloot herself, she fought against this for years. But you know what? I think she needs to be there. This is a book about adding the human complexity back into an illusion of objective scientific truth. When the author has become a character in the lives of her subjects, influencing events in their lives, it works to have the author be a textual presence disrupting the illusion of the objective journalistic truth. She only appears when it’s relevant to her subjects’ story; you don’t hear anything about her story that doesn’t pertain to theirs. And having been in that narrative nonfiction book group for two years, Skloot’s stands out as an elegant and thoughtful approach to the author/subject connection (self-reported femme-fatale author of The Angel of Grozny: Orphans of a Forgotten War, I’m looking at you so hard right now.)
This book pairs well with:
 The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures, another excellent, non-judgmental book about the intersection of science, medicine and culture. With The Mismeasure of Man, for more on the fallibility of the scientific process. It would also taste really good with a kick-ass book about the history of biomedical ethics in the United States, so if you know of one, I’d love to hear about it!"
171,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"I am late to this book party, but let me explain: I get twitchy about medical stuff. Earlier this year I had to abandon Rosemary Mahoney's book about the blind because it described an eye surgery. I have never been able to finish Dr. Atul Gawande's Complications because of its description of medical procedures. It was a small miracle that I was able to finish the Call the Midwife series, because I hate childbirth scenes. When this Henrietta Lacks book started tearing up the bestseller lists a few years ago, I read a few reviews and thought, ""Yeah, that can wait.""Then I started a new library job, and the Lacks book was chosen as a Common Read for the campus. Guess who was volun-told to help lead upcoming book discussions? (Hint: it was me.)So, with a deep sigh, I started reading. And then, oh happy day, my fears turned out to be unfounded because I ended up really liking the story. Rebecca Skloot wrote that she first heard about Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells in a community college biology class. Lacks was a black woman who died in 1951 from cervical cancer. Before she died, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. A key part of this story is that Henrietta did not know her tissue had been taken, and doctors did not tell her family.Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in culture for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal cells ever grown in a laboratory.Henrietta's cells, nicknamed HeLa, were given to scientists and researchers around the world, and they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, Parkinson's disease, and they helped with innumerable other medical studies over the decades. At first, the cells were given for free, but some companies were set up to sell vials of HeLa, which became a lucrative enterprise. The reason Henrietta's cells were so precious was because they allowed scientists to perform experiments that would have been impossible with a living human. They cut HeLa cells apart and exposed them to endless toxins, radiation, and infections. They bombarded them with drugs, hoping to find one that would kill malignant cells without destroying normal ones. They studied immune suppression and cancer growth by injecting HeLa cells into immune-compromise rats, which developed malignant tumors much like Henrietta's. If the cells died in the process, it didn't matter -- scientists could just go back to their eternally growing HeLa stock and start over again.Unfortunately, the Lacks family did not know about any of this until several decades after Henrietta had died, and some relatives became very upset and felt betrayed by the doctors at Hopkins. A few threatened to sue the hospital, but never did.There is a lot of biology and medical discussion in this book, but Skloot also tried to learn more about Henrietta's life, and she was able to interview Lacks' relatives and children. Additionally, there is some good discussion on the ethics of taking tissue samples from patients without their consent, and on the problem of racism in health care.""I always have thought it was strange, if our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can't afford to see no doctors? Don't make no sense. People got rich off my mother without us even known about them takin her cells now we don't get a dime. I used to get so mad about that to where it made me sick and I had to take pills. But I don't got it in me no more to fight. I just want to know who my mother was."" -- Deborath Lacks, who was very young when her mother diedMy favorite parts of the book were the stories about Henrietta and the Lacks family, and the discussions on race and ethics in health care. There's no indication that Henrietta questioned [her doctor]; like most patients in the 1950s, she deferred to anything her doctors said. This was a time when 'benevolent deception' was a common practice -- doctors often withheld even the most fundamental information from their patients, sometimes not giving them any diagnosis at all. They believed it was best not to confuse or upset patients with frightening terms they might not understand, like cancer. Doctors knew best, and most patients didn't question that. Especially black patients in public wards. This was 1951 in Baltimore, segregation was law, and it was understood that black people didn't question white people's professional judgment. Many black patients were just glad to be getting treatment, since discrimination in hospitals was widespread.Skloot worked on the book for more than a decade, paying for research trips with student loans and credit card debt. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in medical ethics, biology, or just some good investigative reporting. Favorite Quote""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different."" -- Deborah Lacks"
172,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61753513-christy,5,"I do believe this book must have scored near the top of all books used in college courses these last 5-6 years - from English to history and social sciences, but I wonder how much traction it got in medical school and across the healthcare and medical research fields. It quickly became a ""classic"" because so many issues are covered: race, class, gender, genetics, property rights, and about the social ends of science and our technological choices. As well, it's a story of how some people are used by institutions for other ends, whether admirably or not, and how unjust and unfair it was to Henrietta to have her cancer cells taken without her permission. She died at age 31 from the cancer, yet the gene treatment her cells produced is tremendously useful in the medical field and will be for a long time to come, hence her ""immortal"" status, yet it gives little comfort to the reader. Ironically, her own family now suffers from a lack of access to healthcare.Kudos to author Skloot who started a the Henrietta Lacks Foundation to help families like the Lacks with healthcare and other financial needs, including more victims of similar experiences, including those of the infamous Tuskeegee experiment with treating only some Black soldiers with syphilis. You can check it out at http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/"
173,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020736-stacey,5,"I've started and erased my little book commentary so many times because this story is so overwhelming and so important on multiple levels, I'm not sure anything I could say about it would do justice to the complexity and dichotomy of the story surrounding Henrietta Lacks. It might not be far from the truth to state that she was the most important person who ever lived. A physical part of her body has saved hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of lives, and improved the lives of countless others. And her story is not over yet. Her cells are still being used in medical research all over the world. But these benefits came at the cost of a violation of her rights, in a time when it was commonplace for doctors and researchers to just do and take, without consent, especially among poor populations and people of color. Some of the things done with Henrietta's cells saved lives, some were heinous experiments performed on people who had no idea what was being done to them, in a grotesquely distorted and amplified reflection of what was done to Henrietta. Nuremberg was dismissed in the United States as something that only applied to the fallen Nazi's. Any act was justifiable in the name of science. And yet, some of the things done right her in our own nation were reminiscent of the research being conducted under the direction of the notorious Dr. Mengele.Reading certain parts of this book, I found myself holding my breath in horror at some of the ideas conjured by medical practioners in the name of “research.” Of course, we know.* Anyone who is even moderately informed on this nation's medical history knows about the Tuskegee trials, MK Ultra, flu and hepatitis research on the disabled and incarcerated, radiation exposure experiments on hospital patients, and cancer, cancer, cancer. The poor, disabled and people of color in this country, the “land of the free,” have been subjected to so many cancer experiments, it defies belief. Many of these trials, including some devised of Henrietta's cells, have involved injecting cancer, non-consensually, into human subjects. So while it is true that there can be utterly no doubt that our lives, and the lives of much of the world, are better, because of the knowledge made possible by parts of Henrietta Lacks's body, still acknowledgment of this reality comes at the cost of knowing that procedures were performed on her without her knowledge or understanding, and without her consent, with impunity; these actions were made even easier because she was poor, black and female, and this is to say nothing of the numerous and unethical violations of her (and her children's) privacy. It's an old story. It's a story that her biographer, Rebecca Skloot, handles with grace and compassion. Henrietta is not some medical spectacle, she was a real woman. If she has been deified by her friends and family since her death, it is maybe the homage that she deserves, not for her cells, but for her vibrance, kindness, and the tragedy of a mother who died much too young. There are a great many scientific and historical facts presented in this book, facts that I couldn't possibly vet for veracity, but the science seems sound, if simplistic, and the history is presented in a conversational way, that is easy to read, and uninterrupted by footnotes and references. Family recollections are presented in storyteller fashion, which makes for easy and compelling reading. Fact-checking is made easy by a list of references, presented in chapter-by-chapter appendices. Rarely do I read something that makes me want to collar strangers in the street and tell them, “You MUST read this book,” but this is one of those times. Henrietta's story is bigger than medical research, and cures for polio, and the human genome, and Nuremberg. Henrietta's story is about basic human rights, and autonomy, and love. It's about knowledge and power, how it's human nature to find a way to justify even the worst things we can devise in the name of the greater good, and how we turn our science into a god. This story is bigger than Rebecca Skloot's book. But I am grateful that she wrote it, and thankful to have read it. Would the story have changed had Henrietta been given the opportunity to give her informed consent? That's the thread of mystery which runs through the entire story, the answer to which we can never know. *documentation in this list is inconsistent, but most of these experiments can be independently verified."

175,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,4,"A lot to process with this book. This book's been out for a while, so I'm just going to put down a bunch of thoughts rattling around in my head, and probably leave it at that:-legacy left by slavery and how it affected Henrietta Lacks and the members of her family, and African Americans in general (where they lived, what kind of employment was available to them, the quality of education available to them, the history of abuse and violence, and the impact on their mental health, and the quality and availability of healthcare)-the assumptions and treatment by the medical establishment, at the time, of their patients and patients' rights-the lack of laws, or their lack of clarity, around a patient's consent, and the ownership of a patient's waste products from medical procedures. This was well illustrated in this book, from the 1950s to the time of the book's publication. -the quality of scientific education and knowledge in the general public. Unless people have some understanding of science, how are they to know what questions to ask of their doctors? The more affluent will generally fare better here, I suspect, what with their access to probably better trained teachers, and the ability to get higher education. And affluence and better outcomes would be partially dependent on where one started out in life.-thank goodness medical procedures improve over time, or are retired in favour of treatments that work!!-bioethics--thank goodness there is debate and evolution of ideas and laws. Though there are probably still lots of grey areas around research and commercializations -I was interested to find out more about the point raised about the DNA of the cell descendants of Henrietta's original cancerous cells.-I was sickened by the treatment, or perhaps I should say mystery around the treatment of Elsie, Henrietta's eldest daughter at the hospital for the insane. Or what doctors could call insane at the time.This was a painful read, but an important accounting of a part of US history, and more specifically, the legacy of slavery on a family, and the changing attitudes and practices in medicine and science."
176,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"I am not sure how is it in other countries but here in the Philippines, if you bring your car for repair in a service center and the serviceman says that he replaced a part, you how to do in you should find that replaced part inside your car. I think it is their proof that they actually replaced that part and also for you to decide how you want to dispose, resell, reuse or recycle it. Normally, this practice bothers me because I have a very small space for junks at home and I do not know what to do with a malfunctioning compressor, air vent, axle, mudguard, leaking pipes, tubes, coolant container, etc. What am I going to do with them? The only thing I know w.r.t. car is how to replace the battery or a flat tire. So, I always end up giving those away to the poor junk man so as to have something to load in his pushcart.It may not be the best analogy to introduce a very compelling book like this. However, the logic is the same. The organ, tissue, cells or fluids that you left in the hospital during your last hospitalization or check-up is totally different from the car spare parts. But both are left after you get what you want and you think they are of no use to you anymore. You gave the authorization for the part to be removed and replaced (if possible) and you deserve to have the replaced unit because legally, you are still the owner of the original or replaced part. However, just like me and the car junks, I would imagine that you don't want to bring home with you some test tubes filled with your excess coagulated blood, liquified Chlorox-smelling semen, miniscule torn ligaments or decayed tooth. What are you going to do with them? Henrietta Lacks, a poor black Tobacco farmer, died of cervical cancer in 1951. Without her knowledge, the doctors got her cancerous tissue and tried to use its cells in a cell culture. Surprise. Surprise. Henrietta's cells propagate like wild fire and they are still alive up to now. It was the first successful cell culture since in all the previous attempts, the cells only lived for few days before dying. The book explains that in Henrietta's chromosomes has enzyme called telomerase that continuously rebuils the telomere which is a string of DNA found at the end of each of Henrietta's chromosome. Skloot says in her introduction that there is more to this, as well as other issues, but apologizes for not excluding them in this book's scope. That's fine with me, because the scientific discussions in the book are just enough for me not to fall asleep and lose interest. We all took Biology in high school and the Cell and its parts, how they work, etc is always that's subject's first lesson so I think you can get by.So what if Henrietta's cells are still alive today? Medical discoveries still happen and we don't know or don't care to know their history. Well, those cells have been used to developed vaccines for polio, gene mapping, cloning, etc. So? Well, Henrietta's cancer cells were used without her or her families consent. Henrietta died 2 weeks after being diagnosed with cervical cancer and she was so poor she had to be buried in an unmarked grave. So? Well, Henrietta was black and the doctors were white. In the 50's, America was still not so open with mixing the two colors. The whites probably would not want to have anything in their body taken from a black person. So? This book tackles a number of controversial questions on medical ethics, racism and social discrimination. However, this is not a serious boring book. Skloot's storytelling does not leave any tinge of textbook formality and this can be read just like any A-grade medical crime bestseller that has some sprinklings of family drama (Henrietta's children have to be given away to relatives after her death), incest (10-y/o Rebecca, Henrietta's daughter, escapes a horny uncle showing his erect penis and she does not know the meaning of a rigid penis) and the struggles of a black family despite having a world-renowned mother whose cells, called the HeLa cells, make a unprecedented contribution to the medical field and in prolonging our life expectancy.So? Well, what if the same thing happens to you? What are the chances that your excess semen was not put in the wastebasket but stored in a sperm bank and given away to childless couples for in vitro fertilization of the wife's ovum? Then what if that child becomes the new Einstein? a new Picasso? a new Shakespeare? a new G.G.Marquez? I'm just saying...  "
177,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3893454-christina,4,"This was an interesting read. While I applaud Skloot's attempt to present a fair look at the history of the HeLa cell line used in research labs all over the world, the book is clearly skewed toward sympathy for the family. Not that they don't deserve sympathy, but really, the problems of the family is NOT the fault of anyone involved with the cell line. Don't get me wrong, Henrietta and her family have had a hard life, and they do deserve some sympathy. But not for this particular issue.The sad fact is that Henrietta died of an aggressive cancer, leaving her family to live their lives without her. That was not her fault or the fault of her family, but it was also not the fault of the hospital staff of Johns Hopkins. Yes, there was racial and socio-economic discrimination, but the fact remains that Henrietta was treated to best of the ability of the doctors at that time. Do we view the taking of cell samples from Henrietta without her permission as unethical today? Most people would say yes. But the law still remains unclear about that, and in 1954 that was most certainly not seen as unethical - it was common practice. So in the context of the time, the act was not unethical. As for monetary compensation, Johns Hopkins did not profit from the growth of HeLa cells; in fact, the scientist that first worked with HeLa cells GAVE the cells away to many many many other labs FOR FREE. Those labs shared with other labs, etc. Are there companies that profit from the cells now? Yes. But they got the cells the same way everyone else did back then - for free. The company then did their own research to find a way to mass produce, store and ship living cells. At the point the first company started mass producing and selling the cells the identity of the donor was long hidden, and the fact the cells were widespread at that time made them common property, so people in possession of the cells could do pretty much anything they wanted with them. And now for the part that is a little stickier - the family found out about Henrietta's cells, were (sort of) tricked into donating blood and cell samples and were kept in the dark about the cell line for decades. Was that right? NO, absolutely not. HOWEVER, I will point out that some of the subsequent anger, confusion and fear on the part of the family was due to their extreme lack of education rather than a malicious attempt to prey upon the Lacks family. The science presented in the book is simplified somewhat for the lay person, which is nice, as is the look at the advances in medicine and research that HeLa cells have brought to the world. As a scientist, however, I think that Skloot's explanations were a little fuzzy and did not really dispel most people's image of how science works in the real world. Perhaps a little more objectivity and less family bonding would have made this a better book.In conclusion: though Skloot claims she tries to give an unbiased view of the history of HeLa cells and the family from whence it came, I am concerned that lay people who read this will not understand some of the finer points and it will increase the already rampant fear of science that pervades American culture. The majority of Americans are woefully un-educated in the sciences, to the point that many people view it as no different than magic,but weirder and scarier. "
178,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1431828-nnedi,5,"What a wonderfully told story. Rebecca Skloot really came through on the research. She dug it alllllll up. And the way she told Henrietta's story was beautiful and almost reflective of Henrietta's life. The story started at a point and then spread out to become a story that enveloped all of humanity. I read this as more research on Henrietta for my forthcoming novel THE BOOK OF PHOENIX and it was exactly what I needed and wanted. I wanted the science but I also wanted the close personal narrative of this woman and the people in her life; I wanted the good, the bad and the ugly. This book was all of that. Some of it is lovely, some was disturbing, plenty of it as shocking, and lots of it was heart-breaking. Her story is so deeplyAmerican. Also, it was really cool how close the writer got to the narrative. and eventually became a part of it. I love that. Oh and there's a touch of African magic in the story, which didn't surprise me at ALL, considering what this book was about. <3'd this book!"
179,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer,4,"You know all those forms you have to fill out while waiting at the doctor and dentist office? The tedious, repetitious ones that you could have sworn you already completed at least a thousand times? Next time you sigh loudly or roll your eyes at the prospect of this task, think about the people who came before us who were never offered the luxury of informed consent, confidentiality, and protection from discrimination. Horrendous injustices prompted these forms into action so that history does not repeat itself. It's a sad thought.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks offers historical insight into human rights issues within the medical field. Primarily though, it focuses on the woman behind the most famous and widely researched human cells in the world: Henrietta Lacks. Her name has only recently become known to the world which is quite sad, but thanks to her family's perseverance and Rebecca Skloot's heavy research and publication, the world now knows who to credit with most medical advances to date. It has been reported that Ms. Lacks had no knowledge of her contribution, as she was unaware that tissues were saved after multiple cancer biopsies/treatments, and therefore, she gave no permission for her cells to be used in any way, shape, or form, but Ms. Skloot reminds us that even today, none of us have any say over what is done with our cells and tissues once removed from our bodies. I appreciated Ms. Skloot's attention to Ms. Lacks' remaining family members and their immense struggles in spite of all the progress (and profits) made in the medical field. In my opinion though, she was a bit too forthcoming in regards to the family. Factors related to race, poverty, education, medical issues, disabilities, and access to healthcare are definitely warranted in a book like this to show the overall contrast between those benefiting from Ms. Lacks' contribution and the family that was left behind, along with the insensitivity and injustice of it all. However, criminal histories, superstitions, and mental illness had no place in this book in my opinion. I believe this was potentially harmful to the family's character, and some portions of the book painted the family in a money-hungry and incompetent light which was unnecessary even if that may have been Ms. Skloot's perception or experience. Regardless, the family's inclusion in this book did make all the difference and I thoroughly enjoyed my reading experience. If you'd like to gain some insight into the history of medical/science research along with a look at human/civil rights issues throughout the decades, check out The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks!My favorite quote:""You don't mess with Henrietta — she'll sic HeLa on your ass!"""
180,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"The doorbell rang the other day and when I answered it, there was a very slick guy in a nice suit standing there and a limousine parked at the curb. He started shaking my hand and wormed his way into the house.“Mr. Kemper, I’m John Doe with Dee-Bag Industries Incorporated. I need you to sign some paperwork and take a ride with me. Don’t worry, I’ll have you home in a day or two,” he said. Then he pulled a document out of his briefcase, set it on the coffee table and pushed a pen in my hand. “Wait a second. What the hell is this all about?” I said as I tried to pick up the paper to read it, but Doe kept trying to force my hand with the pen down on it so I couldn‘t see what it said.“Oh, that’s just legal mumbo-jumbo. You’d rather try and read your mortgage agreement than this old thing. Just put your name down and let’s be on our way, shall we?” he said.There was a brief scuffle, but I managed to distract him by messing up his carefully gelled hair. As he shrieked and ran around looking for a mirror, I finally got to read the document.“This is a medical consent form. What’s going on?” I demanded as I shook the paper at him. Once he had combed and smoothed his hair back into perfection, Doe sighed.“Very well, Mr. Kemper. I guess I’ll have to come clean. Do you remember when you had your appendix out when you were in grade school?”“Sure. That gave me one of my better scars, but that was like 30 years ago. Why are you here now?” I asked.“You’re probably not aware of this, but your appendix was used in a research project by DBII,” Doe said.“Really? I assumed it just got incinerated or used in the hospital cafeteria’s meatloaf special. Why would anyone want to study my rotten appendix?”“Oh, all kinds of research is done on tissue gathered during medical procedures. Most people don’t know that, but it’s very common,” Doe said.“OK, but why are you here now?”“Well, your appendix turned out to be very special. It was secreting some kind of pus that no one had seen before. After many tests, it turned out to be a new chemical compound with commercial applications. So a patent was filed based on that compound and turned into a consumer product,” Doe admitted.“That sounds disgusting. What was it used in? Because I want to make sure to never buy it,” I said.“It’s the basis for the adhesive on Post-It Notes,” Doe said.“Are you freaking kidding me? Post-It Notes are based on my old appendix?”“I’m absolutely serious, Mr. Kemper. Now we at DBII need your help. Unfortunately for us, you haven’t had anything removed lately. So I have to get your consent if we’re going to do further studies,” Doe said.“But you already got my goo-seeping appendix. I don’t have another one,” I said. “True, but sales have been down for Post-It Notes lately. So after the marketing and research boys talked it over for a while, they thought we should bring you in for a full body scan. Maybe you’ve got a spleen giving out or something else that we could pull out and see if we could use it,” Doe said.“This is pretty damn disturbing,” I said.“Why? You’re an organ donor, right? Same thing,” Doe said.“I don’t consider someone lucking into an organ if the Chiefs win a play-off game and I have a goddamn heart attack the same thing as companies making money off tissue I had removed decades ago and didn’t know anything about,” I said.“Fortunately, the American government and legal system disagree. So how about it, Mr. Kemper? Will you come with me?” Doe asked.“I dunno. What’s my end of this? You already owe me a fat check for the Post-Its.”“Oh, no. You won’t get any money from the Post-Its, or if any future discoveries from your tissues lead to more gains.” Doe said.“That’s complete bullshit!”“Again, the legal system disagrees with you. But this is for science, Mr. Kemper. You don’t want to hold up medical scientific research that could save lives, do you?”“It’s for Post-It Notes!”“Maybe, but who is to say that the cure for some terrible disease isn't lurking somewhere in your genes? Could you live with yourself if you prevented crucial medical research just because you were ticked off that you didn’t get any money for your appendix? Remember that it’s not like you could have NOT had your appendix removed. At least, not if you wanted to keep living. And I highly doubt that you would have had the resources to have it studied and discovered the adhesive for yourself even if you would have taken it home with you in a jar after it was removed. We’re the ones who spent all that money to get some good out of a piece of disgusting gunk that tried to kill you. So shouldn’t we be compensated? What are you? Some kind of damn dirty hippie liberal socialist?” Doe said in disgust“You’re a hell of a corporate lackey, Doe,” I said.“Thank you.”“Fine. I’ll do it,” I said as I signed the form. “But I want some free Post-It Notes.”“No deal. Steal them from work like everyone else,” Doe said.******Obviously, I‘m a big fat liar and none of this happened, but I really did have my appendix out as a kid. Plus, my tonsils got yanked and I’ve had my fair share of blood taken over the years. What this book taught me is that it’s highly likely that some of my scraps are sitting in frozen jars in labs somewhere. Yours, too. If any of us have anything unique in our tissues that may be valuable for medical research, it’s possible that they’d be worth a fortune, but we’d never see a dime of it.Henrietta Lacks couldn’t be considered lucky by any stretch of the imagination. A black woman who grew up poor on a tobacco farm, she married her cousin and moved to the Baltimore area. Her husband apparently liked to step out on her and Henrietta ended up with STDs, and one of her children was born mentally handicapped and had to be institutionalized. In 1951, Henrietta was diagnosed with cervical cancer by doctors at Johns Hopkins. During her biopsy, cell samples were taken and given to a researcher who had been working on the problem of trying to grow human cells. Henrietta’s cancer spread wildly, and she was dead within a year. But her cells turned out to be an incredible discovery because they continued growing at a very fast rate. The doctor at Johns Hopkins started sharing his find for no compensation, and this coincided with a large need for cell samples due to testing of the polio vaccine. The HeLa cells would be crucial for confirming that the vaccine worked and soon companies were created to grow and ship them to researchers around the world. Since then, Henrietta’s cells have been sent into outer space and subjected to nuclear tests and cited in over 60,000 medical research papersUnfortunately, no one ever asked Henrietta’s permission and her family knew nothing about the important role her cells played in medicine for decades. Poor and with little formal education, Henrietta’s children were confused by what was actually done to their mother and upset when they learned that her tissue was part of a multi-million dollar industry that they‘ve received no compensation from..Rebecca Skloot has written a fascinating book that clearly outlines why Henrietta’s cells were so important, why she went unrecognized for decades, the pain it’s caused her family, and the way that new medical discoveries over the last sixty years have opened a potential Pandora’s Box of legal and ethical issues regarding tissue collection, research, patents and money. This book brings up a lot of issues that we’re probably all going to be dealing with in the future. Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog."
181,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"This is an all-gold five star read.It's actually two stories, the story of the HeLa cells and the story of the Lacks family told by a journalist who writes the first story objectively and the second, in which she is involved, subjectively. The contrast between the poor Lacks family who cannot afford their medical bills and the research establishment who have made millions, maybe billions from these cells is ironic and tragic. It has been established by other law cases that if the family had gone for restitution they would not have got it, but that's a moot point as they couldn't afford a lawyer in any case. I have seen some bad reviews about this book. People who think that the story of the Lacks - poor rural African-Americans who never made it 'up' from slavery and whose lifestyle of decent working class folk that also involves incest, adultery, disease and crime, they just dismiss with 'heard it all before' and 'my family despite all obstacles succeeded so what is wrong with the Lacks?' I wonder if these people who not only totally can't see the wonderful writing that brings these people to life and who so lack in compassion themselves are the sort of people who oppose health care for the masses? As an extremely wealthy American tourist once put it to me, he had earned good health care by his hard work and success in life, it was one of the perks, why waste good money on, say, a a triple-bypass on someone who hasn't even succeeded enough to afford health insurance? That they were a drain on society, non-contributors and not the way America needed to go to move forward.I don't think you can rate people by what they have achieved materially. Success depends a great deal on opportunity and many don't have that. Henrietta Lacks didn't have it and her children didn't have it, not even her grandchildren made much of a way for themselves, but the next generation, the great grandchildren - ah now they are going in for Masters degrees and maybe their children will be major contributors. The author intends to recompense the family by setting up a scholarship for at least one of them. All of us came originally from poverty and to put down those that are still mired in the quicksand of never having enough spare cash to finance an education is cruel, uncompassionate and hardly looking to the future.HeLa cells have given us our future. They are the most researched and tested human cells in existence. All of us have benefited from the medical advances made using them and the book is recognition of what a great contribution Henrietta Lacks and her family with all their donations of tissue and blood, mostly stolen from them under false pretences, have made. Indeed one of the researchers who looks like having told a lot of lies (and then lied about that) in order to get the family to donate blood to further her research is still trying to get them to donate more. She's a hard-nosed scientist, with an excellent job and income and to her the Lacks are no more than providers of raw material. Sometimes you can't make hard and fast rulings. No I don't think we should have to give informed consent for experiments to be done on tissue or blood donated during a procedure or childbirth - that would slow medical research unbearably. I don't think cells should be identifiable with the donor either, it should be quite anonymous (as it now is). However, there is only ever one 'first' in any sphere and that one does deserve recognition and now with the book, some 50 years after her life ended, Henrietta Lacks has it. Good on yer, Rebecca Skloot, you've done a good thing here."

“She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?”
I've moved this book on and off my TBR for years. The truth is that, with few exceptions, I'm generally turned off by the thought of non-fiction. I'm a fan of fictional stories, and I think I've always felt that non-fiction will be dry, boring and difficult to get through. Especially a book about science, cells and medicine when I'm more of a humanities/social sciences kinda girl.But this book... it's just so interesting. It's written in a very easy, journalistic style and places the author into the story (some people didn't like this, but I thought it felt like you were going along for the journey). It's all the interesting bits of science, full of eye-opening and shocking discoveries, but it's also about history, sociology and race.I started reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks while sat next to my boyfriend. Every so often I would unknowingly gasp or mutter ""oh my god"" and he was like ""what? what?"" and I hadn't even realized I'd done it out loud. It's just full of surprises - and every one is true! It uncovers things you almost certainly didn't know about. And it just shows that sometimes real life can be nastier, more shocking, and more wondrous than anything you could imagine.Maybe you've heard of HeLa in passing, maybe you don't know anything about these cells that helped in cancer research, in finding a polio vaccine, in cloning, in gene mapping and discovering the effects of an atom bomb; either way, this tells an incredible and awful story of a poor, black woman in the American South who was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She is given back her humanity, becoming more than a cluster of cells and being shown for the tough, spirited woman she was. From her own family life to the frankly nauseating treatment of black patients in the 1950s, her story emerges.Not only that, but this book is about the injustices committed by the pharmaceutical industry - both in this individual case (how is it that Henrietta's family are dirt poor when she has revolutionized medicine?) and on a larger scale (during the 1950s, many prisoners were injected with cancer as part of medical experiments!). It's hard to believe what so-called ""professionals"" have gotten away with throughout history - things that we generally associate with Nazi death camps.I honestly could not put it down. Maybe because it's not just about science and cells, but is mainly about all of the humanity and social history behind scientific discoveries. Maybe because Skloot is so damn passionate about her subject and that passion is transferred to the reader. Whatever the reason, I highly recommend it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"
183,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"This was a really good book that leaves one with more questions than it answers, especially at this moment with the explosion in investment and growth in health/biotech. A lot of those questions are ones I wouldn't know how to answer myself either. I think it's really important though that we all start grappling with and instituting better processes around things like informed consent. Also really horrible to think about this in larger societal terms, in the context of institutional racism, and the ways in which the Lacks family still is so socioeconomically disadvantaged while private biotechnology companies sell their mother's cells for so much money. I just feel so extremely uncomfortable with that. I think I wouldn't care so much if the cells were just part of the commons, available for free, or extremely cheaply, but to know people are profiting off of it, it really is quite disgusting. I try not to bring my politics to bear here quite too often but this really really makes me feel strongly that commercialization of things in biological research, especially people's biological matter and tissue shouldn't be happening. This whole situation just feels quite perverse honestly and the book left me feeling disheartened. The dual dehumanization of the Lacks family through science and commercialization is horrifying. And I think if we wants things to be better moving forward both need to be addressed, not just one."
184,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"On October 4, 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a thirty-one-year old black woman, died after a gruesome battle with a rapidly metastasizing cancer. During her treatment, the doctors at Johns Hopkins took some cells from her failing body and used them for research. This was not an unusual thing to have done in 1951. But the cells that came from Ms. Lacks’ body were unusual. They had qualities that made them uniquely valuable as research tools. Labeled “HeLa”, Henrietta’s cells were reproduced by the billions over the following sixty years and have been instrumental in experiments across a wide range of biological science. Today, HeLa cells are sold by the vial at impressive prices. Yet, Ms. Lacks’ family has seen not a penny of compensation from the work that has been made possible by their relative’s unique cells. Rebecca Skloot - from Powell'sRebecca Skloot, a science writer with articles published in many major outlets, spent years looking into the genesis of these cells. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells four stories. First is the tale of HeLa cells, and the value they have been to science; second is the life of, arguably, the most important cell “donor” in history, and of her family; third is a look at the ethics of cell “donation” and the commercial and legal significance of rights involved; and fourth is the Visible Woman look at Skloot’s pursuit of the tales. Each story is significant. The contribution of HeLa cells has been huge and it is important to know how these cells came to be so widely used, and what are the characteristics that make them so valuable. Skloot goes into a reasonable level of detail for those of us who do not make our living in a lab coat. She adds information on how cell cultures can become contaminated, and how that impacts completed research. She also offers a description of telomeres, strings of DNA at the end of chromosomes critical to longevity, and key to the immortality of HeLa cells. Fascinating stuff. Henrietta Lacks - From Science And FilmSkloot constructs a biography of Henrietta, and patches together a portrait of the life of her family, from her ancestors to her children, siblings and other relations. It is with a source of pride, among other emotions, that her family regards Henrietta’s impact on the world. Skloot delves into these feelings, and the experiences the Lacks family members have had over the decades with people trying to write about Henrietta, and people trying to exploit their interest in Henrietta for dark purposes.The author had to overcome considerable family resistance before she was able to get them to meet with and ultimately open up to her. She takes us through her process, showing who she talked with, when, and the result of those conversations, what institutions she contacted re locating and gaining access to information about Henrietta and some other family members. Most interesting, and at times frustrating, is her story of how she gained the trust of some, if not all, of the Lacks family. This is like presenting a how-to of her research process, a blow-by-blow description of the way research is done in the real world, and it is very enlightening.The Immortal Tale of Henrietta Lacks has received considerable acclaim. It is all well-deserved. The book is an eye-opening window into a piece of our history that is mostly unknown. It presents science in a very manageable way and gives us plenty to think about the next time we have a blood test or any other medical procedure.

Strengths:
*Fantastically interesting subject!One woman's cancerous cells are multiplied and distributed around the globe enabling a new era of cellular research and fueling incredible advances in scientific methodology, technology, and medical treatments. This strain of cells, named HeLa (after Henrietta Lacks their originator), has been amazingly prolific and has become integrated into advancements of science around the world (space travel, genome research, pharmaceutical treatments, polio vaccination, etc). *Thought-Provoking Ethical Questions This book makes you ponder ethical questions historically raised by the unfolding sequence of events and still rippling currently. Ex. 1) Informed consent: Henrietta did not provide informed consent (not required in those days). Ex. 2) Genetic rights/non-rights: her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later. Ex. 3) Patents and profits for biologic material: zero profits realized by Henrietta or her descendants; multiple-millions in profits have been realized by individuals and corporations utilizing her genetic material.*Biographical description of Henrietta and interviews with her family.  The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications. We're reading about actual, valuable people and historic events.
Weaknesses:
*Framework: the book is framed around the author's journey of writing the story and her interactions with Henrietta's family. I thought the author got in the way and would have preferred to have to read less of her journey and more coverage of the science involved and its ethical implications. I found myself distinctly not caring how many times the author circled the block or how many trips she made to Henrietta's birthplace.*Lack of Clarity: By mid-point through the book, I was wishing the biographical approach was more refined and focused. The narrative swerved through the author's interest in various people as she encountered them along the way: Henrietta, Henrietta's immediate family, scientists, Henrietta's extended family, a neighborhood grocery store owner, a con artist, Henrietta's youngest daughter, Henrietta's oldest daughter, etc. Everything was a side dish; no particular biography satisfied as a main course.
Bottom Line:
This book won't join my 'to re-read' shelf...but has whetted my appetite for further exploration of this important woman, fascinating topic and intriguing ethical questions.I was left wanting more:-more detail surrounding the science involved, -more coverage of past and present ethical implications-a more refined biography of Henrietta, and -a more focused look at the impact and implications of the HeLa cell strain line on Henrietta's descendants."

A young black mother dies of cervical cancer in 1950 and unbeknownst to her becomes the impetus for many medical advances through the decades that follow because of the cancer cells that were taken without her permission. This book evokes so many thoughts and feelings, sometimes at odds with one another. It is thought provoking and informative in the details and heartbreaking in the rendering of the personal story of Henrietta Lacks. I was madder than hell that people/companies made loads of money on the Hela cell line while some members of the Lacks family didn’t have health insurance . Yet, I am grateful for the research advances that made a polio vaccine possible, advanced cancer research and genetics, and so much more.Rebecca Skloot does a wonderful job of presenting the moral and legal questions of medical research without consent meshing this with the the human side giving a picture of the woman whose cells saved so many lives. We get to know her family, especially her daughter Deborah who worked tirelessly with the author to discover what happened to her mother. This made it all so real - not just a recitation of the facts. The scientific aspects are very detailed but understandable. It was the sections on Henrietta and her family that I wanted to read the most.In 1950 there was “no formal research oversight in the United States.” Years later there are laws on “informed consent “ and how medical research is conducted, and protection of privacy for medical records. Yet even today, there are controversies over the ownership of human tissue. The in depth research over years in writing this book is evident and I believe a heartfelt effort to recognize Henrietta Lacks for her unwitting contribution to medical research."
188,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114573-chelsea,3,"This could have been an incredible book. Henrietta Lacks' story is finally told--and Skloot makes very clear how important Lacks' cells have been to the last 60 years of science and, paradoxically, how much Henrietta and her family suffered because those cells were taken from Henrietta without her consent. But in her effort to contrast the importance and profitability of Henrietta's cells with the marginalization and impoverishment of Henrietta's family, Skloot makes three really big mistakes. First, she's not transparent about her own journalistic ethics, which is troubling in a book about ethics. Did the Lacks family end up benefiting from her book financially? Did all Lacks give permission for their depictions in the book? We never know. Second, Skloot's narration when describing the Lacks family suffering--sexual abuse, addiction, disability, mental illness--lacks sensitivity; it often feels clinical and sometimes even voyeuristic. Again, this is disturbing in a book that concerns the importance of dignity, consent, etc.Finally, Skloot inserts herself into the story over and over, not so subtly suggesting that she is a hero for telling Henrietta's story. Sometimes, it appears that she is making the very offensive suggestion that she, a highly educated unreligious white woman, has healed the Lacks family by showing them science and history."
189,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731872-kathleen,3,"My thoughts on this book are kind of all over the place. I feel for the Lacks family, I really do. It's hard to read about the poverty and lack of education and the cavalier approach towards informed consent in the early days of Johns Hopkins Research Hospital. The fact that the HeLa cell line is the foundation of so much valuable research is rightfully a source of pride for the family of Henrietta Lacks. I don't think they will ever see monetary compensation for their mother's cancer cell line, however. That horse left the barn a long, long time ago.Furthermore, I don't feel the admiration for the author of this book like I think many others do. She wanted to make herself out to be different than all the rest of the people who wrote about the woman behind the HeLa cell line but I only saw the similarities. Yes, she has established a scholarship fund for the descendants of Henrietta Lacks but I got tired of hearing again and again how she financed her research herself. I think the exploitation is there, just prettied up a bit with a lot of self-congratulatory descriptions of how HARD she had to try to talk to the family and how MANY times she called asking for interviews. At times I felt like she badgered them worse than the unethical people who had come before.The sadness of this story is really about the devastation of a family when its unifying force, a strong mother, is removed. Piled on with more sadness about the appalling institutional conditions for mentally handicapped patients (talking about Henrietta Lacks' oldest daughter) back in the 50's and you have tragedy on top of more tragedy."
190,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,4,"This is a very powerful and informative story. Also, with the history of personal freedoms, civil rights, and right to privacy/requiring consent, this is a very important books. I am not sure the details about the science involved in the story will appeal to all. Just the same as how those who are here for the science may be disinterested in the background stories of the people involved. But, if you think you will like one of the other, I don’t think the one you don’t care for will be distracting.With that in mind, I will continue with the statement that it really is two books: the science and the people. First, the background of cell and tissue research in the last 100 years is intriguing and to hear about all of the advances and why Henretta Lacks was key to them is fascinating. Second, the background of not only the Lacks family, but also others who have had their tissues/cells used for research without permission, gives a lot of food for thought. Almost every medical advancement, and many scientific advancements, in the past 60 years are because of Henrietta Lacks. But, questions about the consent she gave, what she understood about her cells being used, and how much the family has benefited are all questioned and discussed. It really hits hard to think that you may have no control over parts of you once they are no longer part of your body. Also, the fiscal and research ramifications of giving people more rights over their body tissue/cells really creates a huge Catch-22. As I had surgery earlier this year that involved some tissue being removed for analysis, it started to make me wonder what I signed on all those forms and if my cells might still be out there being used for research.The only part of the book that kind of dragged for me was the time that the author spent with the family late in the book. After listening to an interview with the author it was surprising to hear that this part of the book may have been her original focus (how the family has dealt with the revelations surrounding the use of their mother’s cells), but to me it kind of dragged and got repetitive. I don’t think it is bad and others may find it interesting, it just was what brought down my interest in the story a little bit.If you like science-based stories, medical-based stories, civil/personal rights history, and/or just love a decent non-fiction, I think this book is very worth checking out."
191,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1992225-liz-nutting,5,"When I was a graduate student in the field of Ethics, one of my favorite pedagogical strategies, as both a teacher and a student, was the case study. A good case study can make an abstract ethical issue more concrete. A really good case study can turn a deeply contentious issue into an opportunity for thoughtfulness and compassion; right and wrong (to the extent that those concepts even belong in the study of ethics) are nuanced by descriptions of circumstances or values or human need that can make it easier to see and hear and believe the ones on the other side(s) of an issue. Often the case studies are hypothetical, or descriptions of actual cases pared to ""just the facts, ma'am,"" without all the possible extenuating circumstances that can shape difficult decisions. For some students, this causes great angst. How could they be asked to make a judgment, especially one that might involve life or death, without knowing all the details? And of course, at the end of the lesson, everyone wants to know what really happened, how things turned out ""in real life."" On those rare occasions when we actually do know something of the outcome, it is clear that knowing what ""really"" happened almost never makes the decision easier, clearer, or less agonizing. And that is what makes The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks so deeply compelling and challenging. It is the rare story of the outcome of a seemingly inconsequential decision by a doctor and a researcher in 1951, one that few at that time would have ever seen as an ethical decision, let alone an unethical one. A researcher studying cell cultures needs samples; a doctor treating a woman with aggressive cervical cancer scrapes a few extra cells of that cancer into a Petri dish for the researcher. The missing cells had no bearing whatsoever on the outcome of the woman's disease, so no harm done. A few weeks later the woman is dead, but her cancer cells are living in the lab. The bare bones ethical issue at stake--whether it is ethically warranted to take a patient's tissues without consent and subsequently use them for scientific and medical research--is even now not a particularly contentious one...yet. Legally, the case law is settled: tissue removed in the course of medical treatment or testing no longer belongs to the patient. It is, in essence, refuse, and one woman's trash is another man's treasure. Ethically, almost all the professional guidelines encourage researchers to obtain consent, but they have no teeth (and most were non-existent in 1951 anyway). In reality, the vast majority of the tissue taken from patients is of limited use. But there are those rare times when a single person's cells have the potential to break open the worlds of science and medicine, to the benefit of millions--and the enrichment of a very few. Such was the case with the cells of cervical cancer taken from Henrietta Lacks at Johns Hopkins University hospital. HeLa cells grew in the lab of George Gey. And grew. And grew, unlike any cell before it. Next, they were carried to a different laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, where Jonas Salk used them to successfully test his polio vaccine, and thus the cancer that had killed Henrietta Lacks directly led to the healing of millions worldwide. Soon HeLa cells would be in almost every major research laboratory in the world. They traveled to Asia to help find a cure for hemorrhagic fever and into space to study the effects of zero gravity on human cells. Even today, almost 60 years after Henrietta's death, HeLa cells are some of the most widely used by the scientific community. With such immeasurable benefits as these, who could possibly doubt the wisdom of Henrietta's doctor to take a tiny bit of tissue? But the ""real"" story is much more complicated. Henrietta Lacks was uneducated, poor and black. Her cancer was treated in the ""colored"" ward of Johns Hopkins. Her death left five children without their mother, to be raised by an abusive cousin. Should any of that matter in weighing the morality of taking tissue from a patient without her consent, especially in light of the benefits? God knows our country's history of medical experimentation on the poor and minority populations is not pretty. Ironically, one of the laboratories researching with HeLa cells in the 1950s was the one at the Tuskegee Institute--at the very same time that the infamous syphilis studies were taking place. In light of that history, Henrietta's race and socioeconomic status can't help but be relevant factors in her particular case. But her children's status? What bearing does that have? According to author Rebecca Skloot, in ethical discussions of the use of human tissue, ""[t]here are, essentially, two issues to deal with: consent and money."" Both become issues for Henrietta's children. The family didn't learn until 1973 that their mother's cells had been taken, or that they'd played such a vital role in the development of scientific knowledge. They spent the next 30 years trying to learn more about their mother's cells. As they learned of the money made by the pharmaceutical companies and other companies as a direct result of HeLa cells, they inevitably asked questions about what share, if any, they were entitled to. As Henrietta's eldest son put it, ""If our mother so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?"" But even more than financial compensation, the family wants recognition--and respect--for their mother. They want the woman behind her contributions acknowledged for who she is--a black woman, a mother, a person with name longer than four letters. And they want to know the mother they never knew, to find out the facts of her death. In the lab at Johns Hopkins, looking through a microscope at her mother's cells for the first time, daughter Deborah sums it up: ""John Hopkin [sic] is a school for learning, and that's important. But this is my mother. Nobody seem to get that."" Would a fully informed Henrietta Lacks have made the decision to give her tissue to George Gey if asked? Would her decision either way have had any affect whatsoever on her children's future lives? We'll never know, of course. But reading the story behind the case study makes these questions far more potent than any ethics textbook can. And as science now unravels the strains of our DNA--thanks in no small part to HeLa--these are no longer inconsequential questions for any of us. Perhaps we, too, like the doctors and scientists who have long studied HeLa, can learn from the case study of Henrietta Lacks. "
192,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-bionic-jean,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is is an extraordinary book. By turns it is shocking, informative and tragic. There is brilliance - but also deep injustice. It is in part an account of the development of genetics, part social commentary, and partly the story of one woman, Henrietta Lacks. She was an African-American woman descended from slaves and one white slave-owner (Lacks), and she lived as many hundreds of black people still did even as late as the 1950's, in poverty in an old slave-cabin - the ""home-house"" - in East Baltimore. And although the events do not always make for easy reading, the author assures us that it is completely non-fiction. Nothing has been invented, nothing exaggerated. The author has done her level best to tell things as they were. Although the name ""Henrietta Lacks"" is comparatively unknown, ""HeLa"" cells are routinely used in scientific experiments worldwide today, and have been for decades. They are the only human cells thought to be scientifically ""immortal"" ie if they are provided with the correct culture and environment they do not die. They were cut from a tumour in the cervix of Henrietta Lacks a few months before she died in 1951; extracted because she had a particular virulent form of cancer. Despite extreme measures taken in the laboratories to protect the cells, human cells had always inevitably died after a few days. HeLa cells though, stayed alive in the petri dish, and proved to be virtually unstoppable, growing faster and stronger than any other cells known.These HeLa cells were used to develop the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilisation and a host of other medical treatments. They were sent on the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity. It is fair to say that they have helped with some of the most important advances in medicine. But there is a terrible irony and injustice in this. The people to benefit from this were largely white people. Henrietta Lacks's family and descendants suffered appalling poverty. Working from dawn to dusk in poisonous tobacco fields was the norm as soon as the children were able to stand. Moving from Virginia's tobacco production to Bethlehem Steel, a boiler manufacturer in South Boston, was little better, as they were then exposed to asbestos and coal. The families had intermingled for generations. Henrietta and Day, her husband, were first cousins, and this was by no means unusual. So the predisposition to illness was both hereditary and environmental. But access to medical help was virtually nil. Most hospitals accepted only whites, or grudgingly admitted so-called ""colored"" people to a separate area, which was far less well funded and staffed. The Lacks family had to travel a long way in order to be treated, and then were not allowed the privilege of proper explanations as to the treatment given - or the tissue samples extracted.At this time unusual cells were taken routinely by doctors wanting to make their own investigations into cancer (which at that time was thought to be a virus) and many other conditions. No permission was sought; none was needed. The Hippocratic oath doctors set such store by dates from the 4th Century BC, and makes no mention of it; neither did the law of the time require it. It was not until 1947, that the subject was raised. Nazi doctors had performed many ethically unsound operations and experiments on live Jews, and during the trials after the war the Nuremberg Code - a 10 point code of ethics - was set up. This states that, ""The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential."" Even then it was advice, not law. Rebecca Skloot says that Howard Jones, the doctor who had originally diagnosed Henrietta Lacks' cancer, said, ""Hopkins, with its large indigent black population, had no dearth of clinical material."" It was clearly a racial norm of the time. In fact to be fair, the white doctors had no real conception that what they were doing had an ethical side. George Gey and his assistants were responsible for isolating the genetic material in Henrietta's cells - an astonishing feat. Gey happily shared the cells with any scientists who asked. The issue of payment was never raised, but the HeLa cells fast became a commodity, and the Lacks's family, who were never consulted about anything, mistakenly assumed until very recently that Gey must have made a fortune out of them. As Henrietta's daughter Deborah said, ""Them white folks getting rich of our mother while we got nothin."" Skloot carefully chronicles some of the most shocking medical stories from these times. The reader infers from her examples that testing on the impoverished and disadvantaged was almost routine. One notorious study was into syphilis and apparently went on for 40 years. It was called the ""Tuskegee study"", and involved thousands of males at varying stages of the disease. At the time it was known that they could be cured by penicillin, but they were not given this treatment, in order that doctors could study the progress of the disease. In this case they were volunteers, but were encouraged by the offer of free travel to the hospital, a free meal when they got there, and the promise of $50 for their families after they died, for funeral expenses. There are many such poignant examples. The author also says that in 1954 thousands of chronically ill elderly people, convicts and even some children, were injected by a Dr. Chester Southam with HeLa cells, basically just to see what would happen. Of course many of them went on to develop cancer. One man who had Hela cells injected in his arm produced small tumours there within days. But the patients were never informed of this, and if they did happen to ask were told they were being ""tested for immunity"". (We are told that Southam was prosecuted for this much later in 1966.) It was not until 1957 that there was any mention in law of ""informed consent."" Confidentially and privacy violation issues came far later.After her death, four of Henrietta Lacks's children, Lawrence, Deborah, Sonny and Joe, were put in the charge of Ethel, a friend of the family who had been very envious of Henrietta. It appears that she was incredibly cruel to the children, hardly ever feeding them until late, after a day's work, when they would be given a meagre crust. She would also drag the youngest one, Joe, out of bed at will, and beat him unmercifully. Joe was only 4 months old when his mother died and grew up to have severe behavioural problems. In fact later on on life, all these children grew to have not only health problems (including all being almost deaf) but a myriad of social problems too - being involved in burglary, assault and drugs - and spent a lot of their lives in prison.One of Henrietta's five children had been put in ""Crownsville Hospital for the Negro Insane"" when she was still tiny, because Henrietta was too ill to care for her any more. The story of this child, which is gradually told through Skloot's text as more of it is revealed, is heart-breaking. It is not clear why Elsie was so slow, but her mental retardation is now thought to be partly due to syphilis, and partly due to being born on the home-house stone floor - which was routine for such families at the time - and banging her head during birth. It was not known what had subsequently happened to Elsie until Skloot's research, but then some records were discovered. A photograph of Elsie shows a miserable child apparently in pain in a distorted position. Apparently brain scans then necessitated draining the surrounding brain fluid. Never mind that the patient might then suffer violent headaches, fits and vomiting for 2-3 months until the fluid reformed; it gave a better picture. Many people had been sent to this institution because of ""idiocy"" or epilepsy; the assumption now is that that they were incarcerated to get them out of the way, and that tests like this, often for research, were routine. Figures from 1955, when Elsie died, showed that at that time the hospital had 2700 patients, which was 800 over the maximum capacity. The ratio of doctors to patients was 1 doctor for 225 patients.Add into this the appalling inhumanity of history where white people used black people for their own ends, and the fears of Henrietta's family and community become inevitable. There had been stories for generations of white-coated doctors coming at dead of night and experimenting on black people. This became confused - or perhaps vindicated - by the Ku Klux Klan. Stories of voodoo, charismatic religious experiences, dire poverty, lack of basic education (one of Henrietta's brothers was more fortunate in that he had 4 years' schooling in total) untreated health problems and the prevailing 1950's attitudes of never questioning the doctor, all fed into the mix resulting in ignorance and occasional hysteria.Much of the first part of this book includes descriptions of scientific research and discoveries; both the theory and practise of how genes were isolated. Alternating with this is the background to the racial tensions, and the history of Henrietta Lacks' ancestry and family. Rebecca Skloot, a science writer, had been fascinated by the potential story since school days, when she first heard of HeLa cells, but nobody seemed to know anything about them. She started this book in her 20's, and spent a decade researching it, financed by credit cards and student loans. As a white woman she was treated with gross suspicion by all Henrietta Lacks's family. Eventually she formed a good relationship with Deborah, but it took a year before Deborah would even speak to her, and Deborah's brothers were very resistant. Several of them were pastors, as was James Pullam, her husband. They believed the Bible literally and had many fears about how Henrietta's cells were used. Deborah herself could not understand how they were immortal. Could her mother's cells feel pain when they were exploded, or infected? Would they develop into half-human half-chicken freaks when they were split and combined with chicken cells? Were there millions of clones all looking like her mother wandering around London? The media worldwide had played its part in adding to these fears, which had been spawned by a genuine ignorance.The interviews with Henrietta's family, and the progress and discoveries Skloot made accompanied by Deborah in the second part of the book, do make the reader uneasy. Indeed parts of these passages read like a trashy novel. Skloot says she wanted to report the conversation verbatim, so the vernacular is reported intact. Fair enough. But there is a lot of, ""Deborah shouted"" or, ""Lawrence yelled"". Of course they did! All of Henrietta's children had severe health problems, probably due to a variety of factors; their environment, upbringing and genetic inheritance. They were all very hard of hearing, so yes, they would shout when amongst themselves. Add to this Skloot's tendency to describe the attributes and appearance of a family member as ""beautiful hazel-nut brown skin"" or ""twinkling eyes"" and there is a whiff of condescension which does not sit well. Does it add anything to this account? Would a description of the author as having ""raven-black hair and full glossy lips"" help? Of course not. The author may feel she is being complimentary; she is not. She is being patronising. But it is difficult to know how else the total incomprehension and ignorance of how a largely white society operated could have been conveyed, other than by this verbatim reportage, even though at worst it comes across as extremely crass, and at best gently humorous.It would be convenient to imagine that these appalling cases were a thing of the past. But the book continues detailing injustices until the date of its publication in 2010. Henrietta's son, Sonny had a quintuple bypass in 2003. Skloot reports, ""The last thing he remembered before falling unconscious under the anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened in medicine."" So far, so good. There was recognition. But Skloot then delivers the final shot, ""Sonny woke up more than $125,500 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery."" As Lawrence (Henrietta's eldest son) says elsewhere, ""It's not fair! She's the most important person in the world and her family [are] living in poverty. If our mother [is] so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""Henrietta's original cancer had in fact been misdiagnosed. It was discovered years later that because she had syphilis, she had the genital warts HPV virus, which does actually invade the DNA. There is an intriguing section on this, as well as the ""HeLa bomb"", where one doctor painstakingly proved to the whole of the scientific community that a lot of their research had been flawed, as HeLa cells were contaminating many of the other cells they had been working with and drawing conclusions from. They were so virulent that they could travel on the smallest particle of dust in the atmosphere, and because Gey had given them so generously, there was no real record of where they had all ended up.Deborah herself always lived in fear of inheriting her mother's cancer. Because of this she readily submitted to tests. Victor McKusick took blood samples, which Deborah believed were for ""cancer tests."" In fact though, Skloot claims, they were for his own research. This is another example of chronic misunderstanding. He knew of the family's mental anguish and the unfair treatment they had had. He thought she understood why he wanted the blood. He gave her an autographed copy of his book - a technical manual on Genetics. Of this, Deborah commented wryly, ""It would have been nice if he'd told me what the damn thing said too."" And again, ""I would like some health insurance so I don't got to pay all that money every month for drugs my mother cells probably helped to make.""In 2001, Skloot tells us, Christoph Lengauer, now the Head of Oncology in one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, said of Henrietta, ""Her cells are how it all started."" And to Deborah, ""Once there is a cure for cancer, it's definitely largely because of your mother's cells.""In 2005 the US government issued gene patents relating to the use of 20% of known human genes, including Alzheimer's, asthma, colon cancer and breast cancer. The injustices however, continue. Pharmaceutical companies, scientists and universities now control what research is done, and the costs of the resulting tests and therapies. An example of how this continues to impede scientific development according to the author is that of the company Myriad Genetics, who hold the patent on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. (These are the genes which are responsible for most hereditary breast cancers.) The company had arbitrarily set a charge of $3000 to have this test, amid furore amongst scientists. They had licensed the use of the test. Anyone who ignored it received a threat of litigation. Eventually in 2009 they were sued by the American Civil Liberties Union, representing a huge number of people including 150,000 scientists for inhibiting research. The commercialisation of human biological materials has now become big business.There seems to have been some attempts at restitution since this book was published, the most recent being in August 2013. There was an agreement between the family and The National Institutes of Health to give the family some control over the access to the cells' DNA code, and a promise of acknowledgement on scientific papers. The committee set to oversee this arrangement will have 6 members, 2 of whom will be members of the family. The wheels have been set in motion.All in all this is an important and startlingly original book by a dedicated and compassionate author. It speaks to every one of us, regardless of our colour, nationality or class. Skloot admitted that it took a long time to decide the structure of the book, in order to include all the important aspects that she wished to. There are three sections: ""Life"", ""Death"" and ""Immortality"", plus an ""Afterword"". The main thrust throughout is clearly the enduring injustice the Lacks family suffered. So perhaps the final words should be Joe's, or (as he changed his name when he converted to Islam in prison), Zakariyya's: ""I believe what them doctors did was wrong. They lied to us for 25 years, kept them cells from us, then they gonna say them things DONATED by our mother. Them cells was stolen! Those fools come take blood from us sayin they need to run tests and not tell us that all these years they done profitized off of her…. You don't lie and clone behind their backs. That's wrong - it's one of the most violating parts of this whole thing….Then doctors say her cells [are] so important and did all this and that to help people. But it didn't do no good for her, and it don't do no good for us. If me and my sister need something, we can't even go and see a doctor cause we can't afford it.""It's too late for some of Henrietta's family. For how many others will it also be too late?"

One scientist estimates that if you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown on a scale, they'd weigh more than 50 million metric tons--an inconceivable number, given that an individual cell weighs almost nothing....Her cells were part of research into the genes that cause cancer and those that suppress it; they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, and Parkinson's disease; and they've been used to study lactose digestion, sexually transmitted diseases, appendicitis, human longevity, mosquito mating, and the negative cellular effects of working in sewers....Like guinea pigs and mice, Henrietta's cells have become the standard laboratory workhorse.(The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, pp. 2-4)Questions:1) Assuming Jesus Christ was speaking literally, please calculate the total mass and volume of the Body of Christ consumed in the period between the Last Supper (c. 30-36 AD/CE) and the present day. Use only estimates for churches and denominations that preach Transubstantiation. Make sure to factor in such estimates as: average mass and volume of the Host and sacramental wine given per recipient, number of recipients per church, number of churches practicing Communion, number of ceremonies per year (approximate), and time elapsed since the Last Supper. Remember to SHOW YOUR WORK.2) Compare the Body of Christ to the Body of Henrietta Lacks. Is the size of the first greater than, lesser than, or equal to, the second?3) Compare growth rates and determine which is greater:a) Your answer in Question #1 over the past 1,980 years (approximate), orb) HeLa's growth since 1951Essay question:Does size really matter? If, in fact, the Body of Henrietta Lacks were larger than the Body of Christ, would that make her worthy of her own religion?Bonus:Pretend you are a prophet of this new religion. Explain the central tenants of HeLaism. Use your imagination, and have fun!"

But what happens when her biological material generates billions of dollars for the drug and pharmaceutical industry, leaving her dirt poor descendants in the lurch?Yeah, I know I wrote that like the teaser for one of my mysteries but the only mystery here is how people who have profited from the diseased cells that killed a woman can sleep at night while her kids and grand kids don't have two nickels to rub together.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is really two stories. One of Henrietta Lacks and her cancer cells that lived decades beyond her years, and the other of Rebecca Skloot and the surviving members of the Lacks family.Henrietta Lacks married her counsin, contracted multiple STD's due to his philandering ways, and died of misdiagnosed cervical cancer by the time she was 30. However, the cancer that killed her survives today in the form of HeLa cells, which have been taken to the moon, exposed to every manner of radiation and illness, and all sorts of other experiments. While other people are raking in money due to the HeLa research, the surviving Lacks family doesn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of, bringing me to the real meat of the book: The pharmaceutical industry is a bunch of dickbags. Imagine having something removed that generated billions of dollars of revenue for people you've never met and still needing to watch your budget so you can pay your mortage. Fair? Shit no, but that's the way it is, apparently. It also seems illogical that you can patent things you didn't create but again, that's the way the cookie crumbles.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an eye-opening look at someone most of us have never heard of but probably owe some sort of debt to. Also, it drags the big money pharma companies out in the sun. Sadly, they do not burst into flames like the vampires they are. Four out of five stars. I'm going to go read something happy now."
195,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,5,"The gift of life is surely the greatest gift of all. So how can the story of the remarkable woman who gave that gift over and over again to millions of people have been overlooked for so long?In 1951 a poor African American woman in Maryland became an uninformed donor to medical science. Henrietta Lacks died at age 31 of cervical cancer at John Hopkins hospital in Baltimore. Then doctors discovered that tumor cells they had removed from her body earlier continued to thrive in the lab - a medical first.Before long, her cells, dubbed HeLa cells, would be used for research around the world, contributing to major advances in everything from cancer treatments to vaccines; from aging to the life cycle of mosquitoes; nuclear bomb explosions to effect of gravity on human tissue during flights to outer space. An estimated 50 million metric tons of her cells were reproduced; thousands of careers have been build, and initiated more than 60 000 scientific studies until now, but Henrietta Lacks never gave permission for that research, nor had her family.In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca Skloot gracefully tells the story of the real woman and her descendants; the history of race-related medical research, including the role of eugenics; the struggles of the Lacks family with poverty, politics and racial issues; the phenomenal development of science based on the HeLa cells, in a language that can be understood by everyone. She combined the family's story with the changing ethics and laws around tissue collection, the irresponsible use of the family's medical information by journalists and researchers and the legislation preventing the family from benefiting from it all.COMMENTSI was gifted this book in December but never realized the impact it had internationally, neither would have on me. Until I finished reading it last night, I did not know it was an international bestseller, as well as read by so many of my GR friends! It was total surprise, since nonfiction is normally not a regular star on bestseller lists, right?The debate around the moral issue, and the experiences of the poor family were very well presented in the book, which was truly well written and objective as far as possible. For me personally, the question of how this woman, who basically saved millions of people's lives, were overlooked, is answered in the arrogance of scientists who deemed it unnecessary to respect the rights of people unable to fend for themselves.The ethical and moral dilemmas it created in America, when the family became aware of their mother's contribution to science without anyone's knowledge or consent, just enabled the commercial enterprises who benefited massively from her cells, to move to other countries where human rights are just a faint star in a unlimited universe. The Lacks family drew a line in the sand of how far people must be exploited in America. Unfortunately the medical fraternity just moved their operations elsewhere.Tissue and organ harvesting thrive in the world, it is globally a massive industry, with the poorest of the poor still the uninformed donors. An open secret. There are numerous stories, especially in India, where people wake up and realize they were operated on and one of their organs is missing. Stolen. By the time they became aware of it, the organ had already been transplanted in America and elsewhere in the world. That's no secret. Everything is justified as long as science is involved.  Nowadays people in other parts of the world sell their organs, even though it is illegal in most countries. According to American laws people cannot sell their tissue, which is part of human organs? People can donate it though, then it is acceptable.Yet someone else can patent your cells, but you're not allowed to be compensated, since the minute it leaves your body, it is regarded as waste, disposed of, and therefor not deemed your 'property' anymore. Huh?This book was a good and necessary read. The human interest side of it, telling the story of the family was eye-opening and excellent. A little bit of melodramatic, but how else would it become a bestseller, if ordinary readers like us could not relate to it. It was very well-written indeed. Thanks to Rebecca Skloot, in 2010, sixty years later, HeLa now has a history, a face and an address. Finally, Henrietta Lacks, and not the anonymous HeLa, became a biological celebrity. In 1951 Dr. Grey's lab assistant handled yet just another tissue sample of hundreds, when she received Henrietta's to prepare for research. She named it HeLa(first two letters of the patient's name and last name). But a few months later she visited the body of the deceased Henrietta Lacks in the mortuary to collect more samples. When she saw the woman's red-painted toenails, a lightbulb went on.Mary Kubicek: “Oh jeez, she’s a real person. . . . I started imagining her sitting in her bathroom painting those toenails, and it hit me for the first time that those cells we’d been working with all this time and sending all over the world, they came from a live woman. I’d never thought of it that way.”John Hopkins hospital could have considered naming a wing of their research facilities after Henrietta Lack. Why don't they?Nevertheless, this book should be read by everybody. Without it the world would have been a lot poorer and less human.The world has a lot to answer for.RECOMMENDED for sure!EDIT I googled the Lacks family and landed upon the website of the Lacks Foundation, which was started by Rebecca Skloot. http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/That news TOTALLY made my day. I wish them all the best and hope they will succeed in their goals and dreams. A wonderful initiative. Just imagine what can be accomplished if every single person, organization, research facility and medical company who benefitted for Henrietta Lacks's tissue cells, donate only $1 (one single dollar)? Yes, just imagine that!So many positive things happened to the family after the book was published. It just brings tears of joy to my eyes.http://www.lacksfamily.net/index.phpAnd finally: May 29, 2010A Historic Day: Henrietta Lacks’s Long Unmarked Grave Finally Gets a Headstonethanks to Dr. Roland Pattillo at Morehouse School of Medicine, who donated a headstone after reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks."
196,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,5,"There are some books that I finish and am left in awe, questioning everything that I thought I knew on a subject. Or, as is the case hear, having learned so much about which I knew nothing. My jaw is still on the floor after I finished this book and I can only imagine the controversies and discussions it might provoke. A thank you goes out to three Goodreads friends who recommended that I read this book and open an avenue for discussion. Aven, Brenda, and Rae, I hope we can begin a wild and intriguing dialogue, pulling others into the mix as things gain momentum.Who was Henrietta Lacks? What are HeLa cells? These are two of the foundational questions that Rebecca Skloot sought to answer in this poignant biographical piece. While I have tackled a number of biographies in my time as a reader, Skloot offered a unique approach to the genre in publication. Henrietta Lacks grew up in rural Virginia, picking tobacco and made ends meet as best she could. After marrying, she had a brood of children, including two of note, Elsie and Deborah, whose significance becomes apparent as the reader delves deeper into the narrative. Skloot offered up a succinct, but detailed narrative of how Lacks found an unusual mass inside her and was sent from her doctor to a specialist at Johns Hopkins (yes, THAT medical centre) for treatment. The mass was malignant and Lacks was deemed to have cervical cancer. Her surgeon, following the precedent of many doctors in the early 1950s, took samples of her tumour as well as that of the healthy part of her cervix, hoping to be able to have the cells survive so they could be analysed. Past attempts by doctors and scientists failed to keep cells alive for very long, which led to the constant slicing and saving technique used by those in the medical profession, when the opportunity arose. As it turns out, Lacks' cells were not only fascinating to explore, but George Gey (Head of Tissue Culture Research at Johns Hopkins) noticed that they lasted indefinitely, as long as they were properly fed. Gey realised that he had something on his hands and tried to get approval from the Lacks family, though did so in an extremely opaque manner. After Lacks succumbed to the cancer, doctors sought to perform an autopsy, which might allow them complete access to Lacks' body. Ignorant of what was going on, Henrietta's husband agreed, thinking that this was only to ensure his children and subsequent generations would not suffer the agony that cancer brought upon Henrietta. So began the conniving and secretive nature of George Gey. He harvested these 'special cells' and named them ""HeLa"", a brief combination of the original patient's two names. Their phenomenal growth and sustainability led him to ship them all over the country and eventually the world, though the Lacks family had no idea this was going on. HeLa cells were studied to create a polio vaccine (Jonas Salk used them at the University of Pittsburgh), helped to better understand cellular reactions to nuclear testing, space travel, and introduction of cancer cells into an otherwise healthy body during curious and somewhat inhumane tests on Ohio inmates. During all this, Johns Hopkins remained completely aware of what was going on and the transmission of HeLa cells around the globe, though did not think to inform the Lacks family, perhaps for fear that they would halt the use of these HeLa cells. Through the use of the term 'HeLa' cells, no one was the wiser and no direct acknowledgement of the long-deceased Henrietta Lacks need be made. Skloot provided much discussion about the uses, selling, 'donating', and experimenting that took place, including segments of the scientific community in America that were knowingly in violation of the Nuremberg Rules on human experimentation, though they danced their own legal jig to get around it all. The crux of the biography lay on this conundrum, though it would only find its true impact by exploring the lives of those Henrietta Lacks left behind after her death.Skloot took the time to pepper chapters with the history of the Lacks family as they grew up and, eventually, what happened when they were made aware that the HeLa cells existed, over two decades after they were obtained and Henrietta had died. Skloot split this other biographical piece into two parts, which eventually merge into one, documenting her research trips and interviews with the family alongside the presentation of a narrative that explores the fruits of those sit-down interviews. That Skloot tried to remain somewhat neutral is apparent, though through her connection to Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah, there was an obvious bias that developed. Superimposing these two narratives would, hopefully, offer the reader a chance to feel a personal connection to the Lacks family and the struggles they went through. In her discussions of the Lacks family, Skloot pulled no punches and presented the raw truths of criminal activity, abuse, addiction, and poverty alongside happy gatherings and memories of Henrietta. No biographical piece would be complete if it were only window dressing and trying to paint a rosy picture of this maligned family without offering at least a little peek into their daily lives. However, it balanced out and Skloot ended up with what the reader might call a decent introduction to this run of the mill family unit. Their ire at being duped by Johns Hopkins was apparent, alongside the dichotomy that HeLa cells were so popular, yet the family remained in dire poverty in the poor areas of Baltimore.The legal ramifications of HeLa cell usage was discussed at various points in the book, though there was no firm case related to it, at least not one including the Lacks family. One person I know sought to draw parallels between the Lacks situation and that of Carrie Buck, as illustrated wonderfully in Adam Cohen's book, Imbeciles (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...). While the courts surely fell short in codifying ownership of cells and research done on them, the focus of Skloot's book was the social injustice by Johns Hopkins, not the ineptitude of the US Supreme Court, as Cohen showed while presenting Buck v. Bell to the curious audience. While George Gey vowed that he gave away the HeLa cell samples to anyone who wanted them, surely the chain reaction and selling of them in catalogues thereafter allowed someone to line their pockets. Skloot offers up numerous mentions from the family, usually through Deborah, that the Lacks family was not seeking to get rich off of this discovery of immortal cells. While companies were spending millions and profiting billions from the early testing of HeLa cells, no one in the family could afford to see a doctor or purchase the medicines they needed (all of which came about because of tests HeLa cells facilitated!). It is both fascinating and angering to see the system wash their hands of the guilt related to immoral collecting and culturing of these HeLa cells. Skloot did explore the slippery slope of cells and tissue as discarded waste, as well as the need for consent in testing them, something the reader ought to spend some time exploring once the biographical narrative ends. It is sure to confound and confuse even the most well-grounded reader.The latter chapters touched upon the aptly used word from the title ""Immortal"" as it relates to Henrietta Lacks. Be it a biography that placed a story behind the woman, a detailed discussion of how the HeLa cell came into being and how its presence is all over the medical world, or that medical advancements as we know them will allow Henrietta Lacks' being to live on for eternity, the reader can reflect on which rationale best suits them. While there is a religious undertone in the biography as it relates to this, Christianity is not inculcated into the reader's mind, as it was not when Skloot learned about these things.Do I know Henrietta Lacks any better now, after Skloot completed her work? Most definitely! Can I, a complete scientific dunce, better understand HeLa cells and the idea behind cell growth and development? Completely! Do I feel there was an injustice done to the Lacks family by Johns Hopkins in 1951 and for decades to come? Yes, I do harbour a strong resentment to the duplicitous attitude undertaken by a hospital whose founder sought to ensure those who could not receive medical care on their own be helped and protected. Is there a lingering legal argument to be made for compensatory damages or at least some fiduciary responsibility owed to the Lacks family? That is a very grey area for me, only further complicated by the legal discussions in the Afterward and the advancement of new and complicated scientific discoveries, which also bore convoluted legal arguments. I will say this... Skloot brought Henrietta Lacks to life and if that puts a face to those HeLa cells, perhaps all those who read this book will think twice about those medicines used in their bodies and the scientific breakthroughs that are attributed to many powerful companies and/or nations. Maybe then, Henrietta can live on in all of us, immortal in some form or another.Kudos, Madam Skloot for intriguing someone whose scientific background is almost nil. You brought numerous stories to life and helped me see just how powerful one woman can be, silenced by death and the ignorance of what those around her were doing.Like/hate the review?

Her story is a heartbreaking one, but also an important one as her cancer cells, forever to be known as HeLa taken without her consent or knowledge, saved thousands of lives.Through ten long years of investigative work by this author, this narrative explores the experimental, racial and ethical issues of HeLa (the cells that would not die), while intertwining the story of her children's lives and the utter shock of finding out about their mother's cells more than twenty years later.""Physician Seeks Volunteers For Cancer Research."" Yeah, right........So many parts of this book made me sick to my stomach.....like the uncaring treatment of animals and all the poor souls injected with cancer cells without their knowledge in the name of research and greed; and oh, dam Ethel for the inhumane and brutal abuse to Henrietta's children too. Unbelievable!Whew! I must admit to being glad when I turned the last page on this one, but big time kudos to Rebecca Skloot for researching and telling Henrietta's story. She deserved so much better."
198,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,4,"Overall, a four star read that should probably be required reading for both biology and American history classes. (Actually, it was a far more interesting read than that makes it sound). While I had heard a great deal of buzz on the book, I wasn't prepared for how the story evolved. The book alternates between Henrietta Lacks' personal history, that of her family, a little of medical history and Skoot's actual pursuit of the story, which helps develop the story in historical context. Skoots included a lot more science than I expected, and even with ten years in the medical field, I was horrified at times. Skoots does a decent job of maintaining a journalistic tone, but some of the things she relates are terrible, from the way Henrietta grew up to cervical cancer treatment in the 50s and 60s. These were the days before cancer treatments approached the precision medicine it is aiming for today, and the treatments resembled nothing so much as trying to cut fingernails with garden shears. Just the thought of a radioactive seed tucked in the uterus causing tissue burn was enough to give me sympathetic cramps.Part of the evil in the book is the violence her family inflicted on each other, and it's one of the truly uncomfortable areas. I think that discomfort is important, because part of where this story comes from has to do with slavery and poverty. There isn't really an ethical high ground here, and that's part of Skoot's skill in setting up the story, and part of the problem in being a white woman telling the story of a black woman. The only reason I didn't give this a five star rating is that the narrative started to fall apart at the end, leaving behind the stories of the cell line and focus more on the breakdown of Henrietta's daughter, Deborah. While I understand she is the touchstone for the story, that she is partly telling the story of the mother through the daughter, much of Henrietta and the science is sidelined.Interesting questions popped up while reading; namely, why does everyone equate Henrietta's cancer cells with her person? As an illustration, if you tell people they have a cancerous tumor, the reaction is ""get rid of it."" It is categorized as ""other"" in everyone's mind and not recognized it as an intrinsic part of the person with cancer. It is not ""them."" Biologically speaking, I'm not sure the book answered the question of whether of not the HeLa cells actually were genetically identical to Henrietta, or if they were mutated--altered DNA. While that might be cold comfort, it's a huge philosophical and scientific question that is the pivot point for a number of issues. Treating the cells as if they were ""normal"" is part of what lead the scientists into disaster as evidenced by the discovery that so many cell lines were HeLa contaminated (I don't believe that transmission mechanism was explained either, which irks me). It also could be the basis for a sophisticated legal and ethical argument."

Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead in 1951. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سی و یکم ماه آگوست سال 2014 میلادیعنوان: حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس؛ نویسنده: ربکا اسکلاوت (اسکلوت)؛ مترجم: حسین راسی؛ تهران آرامش‏‫، 1390؛ در 426ص؛ شابک 9789649219165؛ موضوع: هنرییتا لکس از سال 1920م تا 1951م؛ بیماران و سرطان - اخلاق پزشکی - کشت یاخته ها - آزمایش روی انسان - سده 21م‬زندگینامه ی بیماری به نام «هنرییتا لکس» است، نامش «هنریتا لکس» بود، اما دانشمندان ایشان را با نام «هلا» میشناسند؛ یک کشاورز تنباکوی فقیر جنوب بود، که در همان سرزمین اجداد برده ی خود، کار میکردند، اما سلولهایش - که بدون آگاهی ایشان گرفته شده - به یکی از مهمترین ابزارهای پزشکی تبدیل شد؛ نخستین سلولهای «جاودانه»ی انسانی که، رشد یافته اند، و امروز هنوز هم زنده هستند، اگرچه ایشان در سال 1951میلادی درگذشته اند؛ اگر بتوانیم همه ی سلولهای «هلا» را که تکثیر شده اند، وزن کنیم، شاید وزن آنها به بیش از پنجاه میلیون تن برسد؛ سلولهای «هلا» برای ایجاد «واکسن فلج اطفال» حیاتی بودند؛ سلولهای ایشان، پرده از اسرار «سرطان»، «ویروسها» و اثرات «تشعشعات بمب اتم»؛ برداشتند؛ همچنین پیشرفتهایی همانند: «لقاح آزمایشگاهی»، «کلونینگ» و «نقشه برداری ژن»، یاری کرده است؛ و توسط میلیاردها انسان خریداری و فروخته شده اند؛ با اینحال «هنریتتا لکس» ناشناخته مانده، و در یک گور نامشخص دفن شده استاین کتاب به بخش‌های: برخورد اخلاق در حرفه پزشکی با نژادپرستی، و محرومیت‌های «تاریخی- اجتماعی» رنگین پوستان، برخورد جنبه‌ های معنوی، و حقوقی مالکیت بافت‌های بدن انسان، به تنگدستی و خرافات‌، و برخورد با اکتشاف‌ها، راهکارها، و شیوه ‌های نوین پزشکی هم پرداخته، و نکاتی خواندنی را پیش روی خوانشگر میگذارد؛ «حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس»: صحبت‌ها، یادمانهای نزدیکان «لکس»، و نگاهی به اسناد قانونی، و پرونده‌های پزشکی ایشان نیز هست؛ نگارنده، در این نوشتار علاوه بر نگارش تاریخچة زندگی «هنریتیا لکس» به معرفی «سلول‌های هیلا» و پاسخ‌گویی به پرسش‌‌هایی درباره ی دانش پزشکی، اخلاق، نژاد، و طبقه‌ بندی اجتماعی نیز، پرداخته استا. شربیانی"
200,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6050722-rachel,5,"Full disclosure: I come to this book from a weirdly fortuitous place. Take my brief, but mind-searing, stint in gynecologic oncology research ca. 2002, which involved a weekly trek to the OR to pick up still-warm tumors, with the women who informedly consented to donate them often open on the table as I did so. Then throw in two years working in a tissue culture hood, two more in a narrative nonfiction book group, and another big chunk of time studying infectious diseases. Mix in interests in social justice, bioethics, the history of science, and mysteries, and you’ve got me primed for some outsized adoration of Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, because its three main narratives are: 1) The history of tissue culture, particularly the contribution of the “immortal,” fabulously prolific HeLa cells that revolutionized medical research.2) The life, disease and death of Henrietta Lacks, the woman whose cervical cancer cells gave rise to the HeLa cell line.3) The story of Henrietta Lacks’s impoverished family, particularly her daughter Deborah, belatedly discovering and coping with their mother’s cellular legacy.Intertwined with all three is the concept of informed consent in scientific research, and who owns those bits of us and our genetic information that are floating around the research world. See? That perfect scientific/bioethical/historical mystery doesn’t come along every day. My expectations for this one were absolutely sky-high. And Rebecca Skloot hit it higher than that pile of 89 zillion HeLa cells. Thing is, my particular background can make reading about science kind of painfully bifurcated. I mean first, you’ve got your books that are all, “Yay! Science is totally objective and awesome and will solve all of our problems, so just shut up and trust it already!!” But then you’ve definitely also got your, “Science is just one (over-privileged and socially influenced) way of knowing among many / Medicine is patriarchal and wicked and economically motivated and pretty much out to get you, so avoid it at all costs” books too.Yes, Skloot could have written the story of a poor, black, female victim of evil white scientists. But she didn’t do that. Given her interests, it’s conceivable she could have written the triumphant history of tissue culture, and the amazing medical breakthroughs made possible by HeLa cells, and thank you for playing, poorblackwomanwhomnobodyknows. But she didn’t do that either. Instead, she spent ten years researching and writing a balanced, multifaceted book about the humans doing the science, the human whose cells made the science possible, and the humans profoundly affected by the actions of both. Her book is a complex tangle of race, class, gender and medicine. Of reason and faith. Of knowledge and ethics. Of the chasm between the beneficiaries of medical innovation and those without healthcare in the good old US of A.And Skloot doesn’t have the answers. We don’t get to tut-tut at how much things sucked in the past, while patting ourselves on the back for living in the enlightened present. This is vital and messy stuff, here. The problems haven’t been fixed. Who owns our pieces is an issue that is very much alive, and, with the current onslaught of new genetic information, becoming livelier by the minute. Which is why I would feel comfortable recommending this book to anyone involved in human-subjects research in any capacity...so a boatload of us, really, whether we know it or not.But, buyer beware: to tackle all this three-pronged complexity, Skloot uses a decidedly non-linear structure, one with a high narrative leaps:book length ratio. The three main narratives unfold together and inform each other: we meet Deborah Lacks, while learning about the fate of her mother, while learning about what HeLa cells can do, while learning about tissue culture innovators, while learning about the fate of Deborah Lacks. And Skloot saves the nuts and bolts of informed consent and the ownership of biological materials for a densely packed Afterward. Me, I found this to be a powerful structure and ate it all up with a spoon, but I can see how it could be a bit frustrating. You should also know that Skloot is in the book. According to Skloot herself, she fought against this for years. But you know what? I think she needs to be there. This is a book about adding the human complexity back into an illusion of objective scientific truth. When the author has become a character in the lives of her subjects, influencing events in their lives, it works to have the author be a textual presence disrupting the illusion of the objective journalistic truth. She only appears when it’s relevant to her subjects’ story; you don’t hear anything about her story that doesn’t pertain to theirs. And having been in that narrative nonfiction book group for two years, Skloot’s stands out as an elegant and thoughtful approach to the author/subject connection (self-reported femme-fatale author of The Angel of Grozny: Orphans of a Forgotten War, I’m looking at you so hard right now.)
This book pairs well with:
 The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures, another excellent, non-judgmental book about the intersection of science, medicine and culture. With The Mismeasure of Man, for more on the fallibility of the scientific process. It would also taste really good with a kick-ass book about the history of biomedical ethics in the United States, so if you know of one, I’d love to hear about it!"
201,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"I am late to this book party, but let me explain: I get twitchy about medical stuff. Earlier this year I had to abandon Rosemary Mahoney's book about the blind because it described an eye surgery. I have never been able to finish Dr. Atul Gawande's Complications because of its description of medical procedures. It was a small miracle that I was able to finish the Call the Midwife series, because I hate childbirth scenes. When this Henrietta Lacks book started tearing up the bestseller lists a few years ago, I read a few reviews and thought, ""Yeah, that can wait.""Then I started a new library job, and the Lacks book was chosen as a Common Read for the campus. Guess who was volun-told to help lead upcoming book discussions? (Hint: it was me.)So, with a deep sigh, I started reading. And then, oh happy day, my fears turned out to be unfounded because I ended up really liking the story. Rebecca Skloot wrote that she first heard about Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells in a community college biology class. Lacks was a black woman who died in 1951 from cervical cancer. Before she died, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. A key part of this story is that Henrietta did not know her tissue had been taken, and doctors did not tell her family.Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in culture for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal cells ever grown in a laboratory.Henrietta's cells, nicknamed HeLa, were given to scientists and researchers around the world, and they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, Parkinson's disease, and they helped with innumerable other medical studies over the decades. At first, the cells were given for free, but some companies were set up to sell vials of HeLa, which became a lucrative enterprise. The reason Henrietta's cells were so precious was because they allowed scientists to perform experiments that would have been impossible with a living human. They cut HeLa cells apart and exposed them to endless toxins, radiation, and infections. They bombarded them with drugs, hoping to find one that would kill malignant cells without destroying normal ones. They studied immune suppression and cancer growth by injecting HeLa cells into immune-compromise rats, which developed malignant tumors much like Henrietta's. If the cells died in the process, it didn't matter -- scientists could just go back to their eternally growing HeLa stock and start over again.Unfortunately, the Lacks family did not know about any of this until several decades after Henrietta had died, and some relatives became very upset and felt betrayed by the doctors at Hopkins. A few threatened to sue the hospital, but never did.There is a lot of biology and medical discussion in this book, but Skloot also tried to learn more about Henrietta's life, and she was able to interview Lacks' relatives and children. Additionally, there is some good discussion on the ethics of taking tissue samples from patients without their consent, and on the problem of racism in health care.""I always have thought it was strange, if our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can't afford to see no doctors? Don't make no sense. People got rich off my mother without us even known about them takin her cells now we don't get a dime. I used to get so mad about that to where it made me sick and I had to take pills. But I don't got it in me no more to fight. I just want to know who my mother was."" -- Deborath Lacks, who was very young when her mother diedMy favorite parts of the book were the stories about Henrietta and the Lacks family, and the discussions on race and ethics in health care. There's no indication that Henrietta questioned [her doctor]; like most patients in the 1950s, she deferred to anything her doctors said. This was a time when 'benevolent deception' was a common practice -- doctors often withheld even the most fundamental information from their patients, sometimes not giving them any diagnosis at all. They believed it was best not to confuse or upset patients with frightening terms they might not understand, like cancer. Doctors knew best, and most patients didn't question that. Especially black patients in public wards. This was 1951 in Baltimore, segregation was law, and it was understood that black people didn't question white people's professional judgment. Many black patients were just glad to be getting treatment, since discrimination in hospitals was widespread.Skloot worked on the book for more than a decade, paying for research trips with student loans and credit card debt. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in medical ethics, biology, or just some good investigative reporting. Favorite Quote""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different."" -- Deborah Lacks"

It quickly became a ""classic"" because so many issues are covered: race, class, gender, genetics, property rights, and about the social ends of science and our technological choices. As well, it's a story of how some people are used by institutions for other ends, whether admirably or not, and how unjust and unfair it was to Henrietta to have her cancer cells taken without her permission. She died at age 31 from the cancer, yet the gene treatment her cells produced is tremendously useful in the medical field and will be for a long time to come, hence her ""immortal"" status, yet it gives little comfort to the reader. Ironically, her own family now suffers from a lack of access to healthcare.Kudos to author Skloot who started a the Henrietta Lacks Foundation to help families like the Lacks with healthcare and other financial needs, including more victims of similar experiences, including those of the infamous Tuskeegee experiment with treating only some Black soldiers with syphilis.

203,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020736-stacey,5,"I've started and erased my little book commentary so many times because this story is so overwhelming and so important on multiple levels, I'm not sure anything I could say about it would do justice to the complexity and dichotomy of the story surrounding Henrietta Lacks. It might not be far from the truth to state that she was the most important person who ever lived. A physical part of her body has saved hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of lives, and improved the lives of countless others. And her story is not over yet. Her cells are still being used in medical research all over the world. But these benefits came at the cost of a violation of her rights, in a time when it was commonplace for doctors and researchers to just do and take, without consent, especially among poor populations and people of color. Some of the things done with Henrietta's cells saved lives, some were heinous experiments performed on people who had no idea what was being done to them, in a grotesquely distorted and amplified reflection of what was done to Henrietta. Nuremberg was dismissed in the United States as something that only applied to the fallen Nazi's. Any act was justifiable in the name of science. And yet, some of the things done right her in our own nation were reminiscent of the research being conducted under the direction of the notorious Dr. Mengele.Reading certain parts of this book, I found myself holding my breath in horror at some of the ideas conjured by medical practioners in the name of “research.” Of course, we know.* Anyone who is even moderately informed on this nation's medical history knows about the Tuskegee trials, MK Ultra, flu and hepatitis research on the disabled and incarcerated, radiation exposure experiments on hospital patients, and cancer, cancer, cancer. The poor, disabled and people of color in this country, the “land of the free,” have been subjected to so many cancer experiments, it defies belief. Many of these trials, including some devised of Henrietta's cells, have involved injecting cancer, non-consensually, into human subjects. So while it is true that there can be utterly no doubt that our lives, and the lives of much of the world, are better, because of the knowledge made possible by parts of Henrietta Lacks's body, still acknowledgment of this reality comes at the cost of knowing that procedures were performed on her without her knowledge or understanding, and without her consent, with impunity; these actions were made even easier because she was poor, black and female, and this is to say nothing of the numerous and unethical violations of her (and her children's) privacy. It's an old story. It's a story that her biographer, Rebecca Skloot, handles with grace and compassion. Henrietta is not some medical spectacle, she was a real woman. If she has been deified by her friends and family since her death, it is maybe the homage that she deserves, not for her cells, but for her vibrance, kindness, and the tragedy of a mother who died much too young. There are a great many scientific and historical facts presented in this book, facts that I couldn't possibly vet for veracity, but the science seems sound, if simplistic, and the history is presented in a conversational way, that is easy to read, and uninterrupted by footnotes and references. Family recollections are presented in storyteller fashion, which makes for easy and compelling reading. Fact-checking is made easy by a list of references, presented in chapter-by-chapter appendices. Rarely do I read something that makes me want to collar strangers in the street and tell them, “You MUST read this book,” but this is one of those times. Henrietta's story is bigger than medical research, and cures for polio, and the human genome, and Nuremberg. Henrietta's story is about basic human rights, and autonomy, and love. It's about knowledge and power, how it's human nature to find a way to justify even the worst things we can devise in the name of the greater good, and how we turn our science into a god. This story is bigger than Rebecca Skloot's book. But I am grateful that she wrote it, and thankful to have read it. Would the story have changed had Henrietta been given the opportunity to give her informed consent? That's the thread of mystery which runs through the entire story, the answer to which we can never know. *documentation in this list is inconsistent, but most of these experiments can be independently verified."

205,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,4,"A lot to process with this book. This book's been out for a while, so I'm just going to put down a bunch of thoughts rattling around in my head, and probably leave it at that:-legacy left by slavery and how it affected Henrietta Lacks and the members of her family, and African Americans in general (where they lived, what kind of employment was available to them, the quality of education available to them, the history of abuse and violence, and the impact on their mental health, and the quality and availability of healthcare)-the assumptions and treatment by the medical establishment, at the time, of their patients and patients' rights-the lack of laws, or their lack of clarity, around a patient's consent, and the ownership of a patient's waste products from medical procedures. This was well illustrated in this book, from the 1950s to the time of the book's publication. -the quality of scientific education and knowledge in the general public. Unless people have some understanding of science, how are they to know what questions to ask of their doctors? The more affluent will generally fare better here, I suspect, what with their access to probably better trained teachers, and the ability to get higher education. And affluence and better outcomes would be partially dependent on where one started out in life.-thank goodness medical procedures improve over time, or are retired in favour of treatments that work!!-bioethics--thank goodness there is debate and evolution of ideas and laws. Though there are probably still lots of grey areas around research and commercializations -I was interested to find out more about the point raised about the DNA of the cell descendants of Henrietta's original cancerous cells.-I was sickened by the treatment, or perhaps I should say mystery around the treatment of Elsie, Henrietta's eldest daughter at the hospital for the insane. Or what doctors could call insane at the time.This was a painful read, but an important accounting of a part of US history, and more specifically, the legacy of slavery on a family, and the changing attitudes and practices in medicine and science."
206,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"I am not sure how is it in other countries but here in the Philippines, if you bring your car for repair in a service center and the serviceman says that he replaced a part, you how to do in you should find that replaced part inside your car. I think it is their proof that they actually replaced that part and also for you to decide how you want to dispose, resell, reuse or recycle it. Normally, this practice bothers me because I have a very small space for junks at home and I do not know what to do with a malfunctioning compressor, air vent, axle, mudguard, leaking pipes, tubes, coolant container, etc. What am I going to do with them? The only thing I know w.r.t. car is how to replace the battery or a flat tire. So, I always end up giving those away to the poor junk man so as to have something to load in his pushcart.It may not be the best analogy to introduce a very compelling book like this. However, the logic is the same. The organ, tissue, cells or fluids that you left in the hospital during your last hospitalization or check-up is totally different from the car spare parts. But both are left after you get what you want and you think they are of no use to you anymore. You gave the authorization for the part to be removed and replaced (if possible) and you deserve to have the replaced unit because legally, you are still the owner of the original or replaced part. However, just like me and the car junks, I would imagine that you don't want to bring home with you some test tubes filled with your excess coagulated blood, liquified Chlorox-smelling semen, miniscule torn ligaments or decayed tooth. What are you going to do with them? Henrietta Lacks, a poor black Tobacco farmer, died of cervical cancer in 1951. Without her knowledge, the doctors got her cancerous tissue and tried to use its cells in a cell culture. Surprise. Surprise. Henrietta's cells propagate like wild fire and they are still alive up to now. It was the first successful cell culture since in all the previous attempts, the cells only lived for few days before dying. The book explains that in Henrietta's chromosomes has enzyme called telomerase that continuously rebuils the telomere which is a string of DNA found at the end of each of Henrietta's chromosome. Skloot says in her introduction that there is more to this, as well as other issues, but apologizes for not excluding them in this book's scope. That's fine with me, because the scientific discussions in the book are just enough for me not to fall asleep and lose interest. We all took Biology in high school and the Cell and its parts, how they work, etc is always that's subject's first lesson so I think you can get by.So what if Henrietta's cells are still alive today? Medical discoveries still happen and we don't know or don't care to know their history. Well, those cells have been used to developed vaccines for polio, gene mapping, cloning, etc. So? Well, Henrietta's cancer cells were used without her or her families consent. Henrietta died 2 weeks after being diagnosed with cervical cancer and she was so poor she had to be buried in an unmarked grave. So? Well, Henrietta was black and the doctors were white. In the 50's, America was still not so open with mixing the two colors. The whites probably would not want to have anything in their body taken from a black person. So? This book tackles a number of controversial questions on medical ethics, racism and social discrimination. However, this is not a serious boring book. Skloot's storytelling does not leave any tinge of textbook formality and this can be read just like any A-grade medical crime bestseller that has some sprinklings of family drama (Henrietta's children have to be given away to relatives after her death), incest (10-y/o Rebecca, Henrietta's daughter, escapes a horny uncle showing his erect penis and she does not know the meaning of a rigid penis) and the struggles of a black family despite having a world-renowned mother whose cells, called the HeLa cells, make a unprecedented contribution to the medical field and in prolonging our life expectancy.So? Well, what if the same thing happens to you? What are the chances that your excess semen was not put in the wastebasket but stored in a sperm bank and given away to childless couples for in vitro fertilization of the wife's ovum? Then what if that child becomes the new Einstein? a new Picasso? a new Shakespeare? a new G.G.Marquez? I'm just saying...  "
207,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3893454-christina,4,"This was an interesting read. While I applaud Skloot's attempt to present a fair look at the history of the HeLa cell line used in research labs all over the world, the book is clearly skewed toward sympathy for the family. Not that they don't deserve sympathy, but really, the problems of the family is NOT the fault of anyone involved with the cell line. Don't get me wrong, Henrietta and her family have had a hard life, and they do deserve some sympathy. But not for this particular issue.The sad fact is that Henrietta died of an aggressive cancer, leaving her family to live their lives without her. That was not her fault or the fault of her family, but it was also not the fault of the hospital staff of Johns Hopkins. Yes, there was racial and socio-economic discrimination, but the fact remains that Henrietta was treated to best of the ability of the doctors at that time. Do we view the taking of cell samples from Henrietta without her permission as unethical today? Most people would say yes. But the law still remains unclear about that, and in 1954 that was most certainly not seen as unethical - it was common practice. So in the context of the time, the act was not unethical. As for monetary compensation, Johns Hopkins did not profit from the growth of HeLa cells; in fact, the scientist that first worked with HeLa cells GAVE the cells away to many many many other labs FOR FREE. Those labs shared with other labs, etc. Are there companies that profit from the cells now? Yes. But they got the cells the same way everyone else did back then - for free. The company then did their own research to find a way to mass produce, store and ship living cells. At the point the first company started mass producing and selling the cells the identity of the donor was long hidden, and the fact the cells were widespread at that time made them common property, so people in possession of the cells could do pretty much anything they wanted with them. And now for the part that is a little stickier - the family found out about Henrietta's cells, were (sort of) tricked into donating blood and cell samples and were kept in the dark about the cell line for decades. Was that right? NO, absolutely not. HOWEVER, I will point out that some of the subsequent anger, confusion and fear on the part of the family was due to their extreme lack of education rather than a malicious attempt to prey upon the Lacks family. The science presented in the book is simplified somewhat for the lay person, which is nice, as is the look at the advances in medicine and research that HeLa cells have brought to the world. As a scientist, however, I think that Skloot's explanations were a little fuzzy and did not really dispel most people's image of how science works in the real world. Perhaps a little more objectivity and less family bonding would have made this a better book.In conclusion: though Skloot claims she tries to give an unbiased view of the history of HeLa cells and the family from whence it came, I am concerned that lay people who read this will not understand some of the finer points and it will increase the already rampant fear of science that pervades American culture. The majority of Americans are woefully un-educated in the sciences, to the point that many people view it as no different than magic,but weirder and scarier. "
208,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1431828-nnedi,5,"What a wonderfully told story. Rebecca Skloot really came through on the research. She dug it alllllll up. And the way she told Henrietta's story was beautiful and almost reflective of Henrietta's life. The story started at a point and then spread out to become a story that enveloped all of humanity. I read this as more research on Henrietta for my forthcoming novel THE BOOK OF PHOENIX and it was exactly what I needed and wanted. I wanted the science but I also wanted the close personal narrative of this woman and the people in her life; I wanted the good, the bad and the ugly. This book was all of that. Some of it is lovely, some was disturbing, plenty of it as shocking, and lots of it was heart-breaking. Her story is so deeplyAmerican. Also, it was really cool how close the writer got to the narrative. and eventually became a part of it. I love that. Oh and there's a touch of African magic in the story, which didn't surprise me at ALL, considering what this book was about. <3'd this book!"
209,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer,4,"You know all those forms you have to fill out while waiting at the doctor and dentist office? The tedious, repetitious ones that you could have sworn you already completed at least a thousand times? Next time you sigh loudly or roll your eyes at the prospect of this task, think about the people who came before us who were never offered the luxury of informed consent, confidentiality, and protection from discrimination. Horrendous injustices prompted these forms into action so that history does not repeat itself. It's a sad thought.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks offers historical insight into human rights issues within the medical field. Primarily though, it focuses on the woman behind the most famous and widely researched human cells in the world: Henrietta Lacks. Her name has only recently become known to the world which is quite sad, but thanks to her family's perseverance and Rebecca Skloot's heavy research and publication, the world now knows who to credit with most medical advances to date. It has been reported that Ms. Lacks had no knowledge of her contribution, as she was unaware that tissues were saved after multiple cancer biopsies/treatments, and therefore, she gave no permission for her cells to be used in any way, shape, or form, but Ms. Skloot reminds us that even today, none of us have any say over what is done with our cells and tissues once removed from our bodies. I appreciated Ms. Skloot's attention to Ms. Lacks' remaining family members and their immense struggles in spite of all the progress (and profits) made in the medical field. In my opinion though, she was a bit too forthcoming in regards to the family. Factors related to race, poverty, education, medical issues, disabilities, and access to healthcare are definitely warranted in a book like this to show the overall contrast between those benefiting from Ms. Lacks' contribution and the family that was left behind, along with the insensitivity and injustice of it all. However, criminal histories, superstitions, and mental illness had no place in this book in my opinion. I believe this was potentially harmful to the family's character, and some portions of the book painted the family in a money-hungry and incompetent light which was unnecessary even if that may have been Ms. Skloot's perception or experience. Regardless, the family's inclusion in this book did make all the difference and I thoroughly enjoyed my reading experience. If you'd like to gain some insight into the history of medical/science research along with a look at human/civil rights issues throughout the decades, check out The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks!My favorite quote:""You don't mess with Henrietta — she'll sic HeLa on your ass!"""
210,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,5,"Henrietta Lacks is a woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951. The cells cut from her body, because of their aptitude for growth and replication, still play a significant role in treating disease and other medical tests. She did not know her cells were being used, and her family did not benefit financially. The author writes extensively about her family, as they were a crucial source for the book. Because of so many trust relationships violated over the years, she had to first work to build trust and prove herself reliable. She went on to establish a trust for the family.This book discusses science, both the present state of medicine while Henrietta was being treated for cervical cancer (nothing short of radium tube inserts and lead!) and how science has grown in its understandings and treatments because of her cells. The book has to address the ways African Americans have been treated badly by the American medical establishment from Tuskagee to forced sterilizations, to even some patients injected with Henrietta's cells without their knowledge! I felt like I knew much of the story already, but only because this book has received so much acclaim and press, and I find rightly so. I'm not a scientist but felt I could understand it as Skloot presented the information.I also learned some terrifying things that don't soothe my paranoia. Huge government stores of cells that no longer belong to you - not owning the rights to your bodily tissue - still all true in the 21st century. Ever wonder where your blood, teeth, etc. got to? Ha. I read this during Banned Books Week 2015 because earlier this year it was challenged by a Tennessee mother who felt it was ""pornographic."" The woman had cervical cancer, cancer of the CERVIX, a body part all women have. Oh please. This book isn't pornography, it's science. Discussed on Episode 042 of the Reading Envy Podcast."
211,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186579-kate,1,"This book irritated me from the beginning. It couldn't decide if it was a history of the cells, the life story of one woman, a chronicle of how an author tracks down the life story of a woman, a position paper on racism, a position paper on human tissue ownership, or a position paper on disorganized rhetoric. I think it was all of those, and it drove me absolutely up the wall.As a history of the HeLa cells ... I read a Wired article that was better.As the life story of Henrietta Lacks ... it read like a list of facts instead of a human interest piece. And it kept going on tangents (with the life stories of each of her children, her doctors, etc.)As the story of the author tracking down a story ... that was actually kind of interesting.As a position paper on racism...it had a lot of disturbing stories - but no cohesive point.As a position paper on human tissue ownership... the best chapter was the last one, which actually listed facts and laws. And while the author clearly had an opinion in that chapter -it was more focused and less full of unrelated stories intended to pull on your hearts strings and shift your opinion.As a position paper on disorganized rhetoric...it was a stellar exemplar."
212,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"I don't know how many copies of a book need to be sold before it can be fairly described as a best-seller. In any case what kind of bearing does the number of copies sold have on the amount that a book is read? The success of Rebecca Skloot's book is maybe entirely unsurprising as it covers a wide range of angles and caters for many tastes. It has something of the ever popular misery mémoire, some social history, an investigative aspect with detective road trips, along with an exploration of one of the wonders of modern science. All of this comes together in two alternating narrative strands, the death of Henrietta Lacks from cancer and the strange ongoing life and use of a tissue sample collected from her that has been used for a host of purposes from cancer research to gene mapping to assessing human sensitivity to commercial products, as well as the impact of her life and death on her young family. As a whole it was a moving reading experience.The story told is a very simple one, and I found how it is told completely effective. It is not surprising that some forms of cancer, even with treatment, are fatal. It is not surprising that poor black people in the USA remain poor over time, it is not surprising that difficult childhood experiences can overshadow later adult lives, it is even not surprising that something if not entirely free to obtain like the tissue sample in question, has come to be a source of profit for many companies while providing no benefit to either the donor’s family nor the institution which provided Henrietta Lacks with medical treatment and collected the sample in the first place. Perhaps part of the success of Skloot's narration is just how unsurprising those elements of the story are juxtaposed with the completely unexpected survival and continuing life of Henrietta Lacks' tissue sample. There is a recognisable slice of life married with something unique so far in science and of enduring scientific impact.For me the most serious downside is that I had the feeling that Skloot had hoped her book might start a public debate on issues of sample ownership, but so far that discussion so far has not escaped the courts. That leaves us with a great piece of non-fiction writing rather than a rallying cry for change."
213,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,5,"In reading non-fiction, and particularly scientific non-fiction, my two most frequent gripes are: a lack of personal story, and a lack of overall narrative. It's my opinion that just because a work isn't fiction, it shouldn't miss out on the use of structural elements more common to fiction: a strong narrative and narrative structure can improve any kind of communication.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a near-flawless implementation of this. The book has three components: the story of Henrietta and her family, the story of the science made possible by Henrietta, and the story of the author, Skloot, researching the book. I can't stress enough how effectively these three threads are woven together, making a educational, intersectional, and ultimately tragic story. If you are interested in the human side of scientific advance then this is an absolute, absolute must-read. Highly recommended."

They turned out to be very essential to modern medical advancements.I found this to be an interesting book, mainly because it taught me a few science/medical bits, and it made me think more deeply about ethical issues related to tissue ownership. As always, I enjoyed the close-up views of racial issues.I'm glad that the author wrote this book, as I'm sure it helped Henrietta's family understand what really took place all those years ago. It also makes all of us aware of the debt we owe to Henrietta.4 Stars = Outstanding. It definitely held my interest."
215,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5036644-meredith-o-donnell,2,"Interesting concept. Reading it with my book club... Upate: Finished. I am always up for a rousing ethical debate. The deplorable breach of privacy, a basic human right, displayed in the book was appalling. Anyone who has ever been dehumanized can relate to the way Henrietta was objectified for the sake of science. It was beyond unconscionable. I am glad the story was told. I hope that Skloot's efforts will remind the industry of science and medicine that they need to be held accountable for their actions, and the finished product is not the only thing that matters, but the methods taken on their road to discovery count as well. Henrietta's cells have provided mankind with a lot to be grateful for, and for that we must thank the scientists and doctors who worked feverishly and masterfully, experimenting and coming up with new ideas. However, the people behind the cells have rights too. Bioethics have come a long way since the 1950's, but there are still flaws.  I learned in several journalism courses I took in college that the job of the journalist is to hold accountable those who serve the public--be it in politics, consumerism, or medicine. That is what Skloot has done by tackling the story of Henrietta Lacks--the person behind the immortal HeLa cell line. For that, I commend her. While I agreed with the endeavor, I had a few issues with her strategy. As others have mentioned, she placed herself in the story excessively. She claimed it was necessary, but I doubt if it was necessary to the extent that she did it. She seemed to want to constantly remind the reader of her plight. This is not the place of a journalist--just tell the story, don't tell your own story of getting the story. Also, she had an incredibly obvious bias, and a suspiciously not-so-obvious agenda. I did question Skloot's intentions. She spoke as an advocate for the Lacks family, but I do wonder whether or not she was a welcomed one, or a useful one.  She classifies the book as nonfiction upfront. And that it is. Or was intended to be... the story is real. But the details were so convoluted, shrouded and murky that it became difficult to truly believe with any authority one thing or the other. For instance, Skloot admits that the medical field was not proficient in recording things during this time (no computer.) Consequently, a lot of important details concerning Henrietta's illness, diagnosis, the retrieval of her cells, her death, her autopsy, her burial, among other factors, were not clearly documented. Also, Skloot's main sources of information were the Lacks family--a family frought with incest, disease, mental illness, partial deafness, drug abuse, a lack of intelligence and a lack of education--none of which was their fault, but all of which made them unreliable sources of information. For instance-- did Henrietta ever meet Gey? His assistant Mary swears yes. But Dave Lacks says absolutely not. The tie breaker is dead..and was on her death bed/twisted with pain/heavily medicated during the time of the alleged meeting so it is not out of the realm of possibilities that she either forgot about the encounter or didn't think to bring it up. It's also just as possible that Mary was confused (no documentation,) or was lying. I have no reason to believe one over the other. Also, Joe's murder. Skloot decided to present the family's convenient recollection of events authoritatively--that it was self defense. However, a witness testified under oath that the fatal attack was unprovoked. Again, I have no incentive to take one side over the other, but Skloot's selective storytelling contributed to my distrust of her as a narrator, a writer and a reporter.  When I read a nonfiction piece, I prefer for the facts to be indisputable. Aside from credibility issues, I also questioned Skloot's true motives. She hid behind an ultra-liberal facade: a sympathetic crusader who was empowering this poor, uneducated family with the voice they never had. But notice how she proudly boasts of a deep friendship with Deborah Lacks in the beginning of the book... but I wonder if Deborah, God rest her soul, would confirm this claim. We'll never know. Skloot seemed to pester the family, while at the same time condemning those who did the same...as if her reasons were more pure and justifiable. She also clearly lamented their lack of medical coverage and financial compensation, and a portion of the proceeds for the book will go to a scholarship fund for the family, but why didn't she just write them a big check? They didn't benefit directly. If you read closely, Skloot reveals that she had to agree to certain conditions before the Lacks family would agree to talk to her. She had to tell the family's story exactly the way it was told to her, whether facts were verified or not. She was so desperate to satisfy, what started out as her own morbid curiosity, and grew into an obsessive mission, that she agreed to this stipulation. That almost concealed little tidbit, combined with the unreliability and untrustworthiness of the medical profession during that time, left this reader skeptical of nearly every word. However, the subject matter and her insistance to reinstate the human side to a research subject, as well as the fact that Skloot manages to make very technical terminology and notions perfectly clear to a former B student in Biology, earn the writer one star each. I recommend reading along side Oliver Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat-- another nonfiction piece about the humanization of patients. Meredith O'Donnell"
216,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is fascinating and heartbreaking in equal measure. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Before she died, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in cultures for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory. Those cells, known as HeLa, are still alive today and have advanced medicine and science in countless ways; it seems there's no end to the list of discoveries made because of HeLa.I've tried to imagine how [Henrietta would] feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. Henrietta's cells helped launch the fledgling field of virology. As the Cold War escalated, some scientists exposed Henrietta's cells to massive doses of radiation to study how nuclear bombs destroyed cells and find ways to reverse that damage. Others put them in special centrifuges that spun so fast the pressure inside was more than 100,000 times that of gravity, to see what happened to human cells under the extreme conditions of deep-sea diving or spaceflight. The author took great care to learn about Henrietta Lacks. She paints Henrietta as a woman who accepted her illness and faced her treatment with unparalleled resilience and strength. One afternoon, as Henrietta lay on the couch, she lifted her shirt to show Margaret and Sadie what the treatments had done to her. Sadie gasped: The skin from Henrietta's breasts to her pelvis was charred a deep black from the radiation. The rest of her body was its normal shade -- more the color of fawn than coal. ""Hennie,"" she whispered, ""they burn you black as tar."" Henrietta just nodded and said, ""Lord, it just feels like that blackness be spreadin all inside me."" Cancer is a foul creature, sinister and terrifying, but Henrietta's cancer was a force of evil from the nadir of Hell. It ravaged her body in unmerciful ways; it's no wonder those cells survived in a test tube where all other cells died. Suddenly [Henrietta's] body went rigid as a board. She screamed as the nurse ran to the bed, tightening the straps around Henrietta's arms and legs to keep her from thrashing onto the floor as she'd done many times before. Gladys thrust the pillow from her lap into Henrietta's mouth, to keep her from biting her tongue as she convulsed in pain. The book is extensive; all of the information is efficiently organized and comprehensive. Part of what makes this book so tantalizing are all of the near-misses, all of the moments when the author was turned down in her quest to learn the truth about Henrietta Lacks. Had she given up, as so many others did, Henrietta Lacks might have been forgotten and this riveting book would have never existed. "
217,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6942006-suzy,5,"I was completely in the thrall of author Rebecca Skloot while listening to the audio of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. This is at once a scientific story of Henrietta's cancer cells, called HeLa, which were harvested from her as she was dying from cervical cancer in 1951. These are the first human cells to become ""immortal"", perpetuating themselves even to today, and being used in many important health discoveries including polio vaccines, in vitro fertilization, aids research, cancer drugs and too many others to mention. It is also the story of Henrietta and her family, who had no idea that their mother's cells were taken or the importance of the cells to medicine. Her children learn about this from Skloot's research and this knowledge causes misunderstandings and various reactions in Henrietta's adult children from some wanting financial remuneration to others just wanting their mother to be honored and respected for her contribution to science. My heart went out to Henrietta and her family who, because they were poor and black, were treated, and lived, as second class citizens. They are often at the mercy of their many health problems through lack of education, lack of access to health insurance and suspicions about the medical establishment. It seems so unjust! (Thanks to GR friend Will Byrnes for posting this NY Times article on the consent agreement reached with the family finally . . . 62 years later. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/sci...)At first I found the structure of the book a little frustrating because it jumped in both time and storyline, but once I decided to just flow with it, I was completely engaged. I think listening helped. It was as if the author was telling her story just to me, and that I was discovering it side-by-side with her. There are so many layers, that my thought is there's something to connect to for everyone based on a reader's interests coming to the book. Skloot reveals early in the book that she learned about HeLa in a biology class when she was younger and decided then and there to research and write about them. Little did she know that she would be telling the story of the Lacks family right along with the scientific importance of the cells. I appreciated the interview at the end of the audio where Skloot tells us how she decided on the focus and the structure of the book. This was the February book club pick at our wonderful art museum here in Minneapolis, and I enjoyed the discussion. I'm eagerly anticipating the HBO movie based on the book which will be aired April 22 here in the States. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5686132/"

It was her cells that helped discover the polio vaccine, DNA mapping, cloning, and so much more. Because of Henrietta, we know how massive doses of radiation affect the human body, and also what cells do in a zero gravity environment. The list of her contributions to science go on and on.Henrietta’s cells were taken without her permission or knowledge in early 1951. More than twenty years would pass before her family ever found out. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is Henrietta’s story, the story of her cell’s contribution to science, and the story of her family. I learned a lot from this book about Henrietta, science, and past and present patient rights in the United States. Some of the information found on these pages are truly alarming. Rebecca Skloot did a thorough and diligent job with her research, and her writing is exceptional. I’m grateful to Rebecca for telling Henrietta’s story!"

I'm grateful to have learned the story of Henrietta Lacks, but the book just wasn't riveting for me. It was fascinating, in many ways, but I felt like it could have been half as long and just as effective. I liked it, but I more admired it than wanted to read it again."

222,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20015365-may,4,"As a medical student, I was, and still am ashamed, that I knew next-to-nothing about Henrietta Lacks and the HUGE contribution her cells have made to science. The fact that her family can't even get reliable health insurance really just adds insult to injury. This is a well-researched, well-written book. The issue it discusses is extremely important, and the last chapter about tissue ownership is outright terrifying. It was the first time I heard of ""gene patents"" (what?), and this:Myriad Genetics, which holds the patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes responsible for most cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, charges $3,000 to test for the genes. Myriad has been accused of creating a monopoly, since no one else can offer the test, and researchers can’t develop cheaper tests or new therapies without getting permission from Myriad and paying steep licensing fees. Scientists who’ve gone ahead with research involving the breast-cancer genes without Myriad’s permission have found themselves on the receiving end of cease-and-desist letters and threats of litigation.I don't know what to say. I think this paragraph sums it up very well:
The debate over the commercialization of human biological materials always comes back to one fundamental point: like it or not, we live in a market-driven society, and science is part of that market. Baruch Blumberg, the Nobel Prize-winning researcher who used Ted Slavin’s antibodies for hepatitis B research, told me, “Whether you think the commercialization of medical research is good or bad depends on how into capitalism you are.” On the whole, Blumberg said, commercialization is good; how else would we get the drugs and diagnostic tests we need? Still, he sees a downside. “I think it’s fair to say it’s interfered with science,” he said. “It’s changed the spirit.” Now there are patents and proprietary information where there once was free information flow. “Researchers have become entrepreneurs. That’s boomed our economy and created incentives to do research. But it’s also brought problems, like secrecy and arguments over who owns what.”

223,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,5,"This is a phenomenal book. If it doesn't win every non-fiction award for 2010 than whoever votes for non-fiction awards should have their library cards taken away from them*.The author, Rebecca Skloot, does a masterful job of seamlessly weaving in the scientific story of Henrietta Lacks' immortal cells and the effect they have had on medicine and medical ethics with a real human interest story about Henrietta and the struggles of her family. Skloot does this without coming across as maudlin, preachy, overly technical, guilt ridden, condescending, or just plain boring. She deftly weaves two legs of one story together, darting in and out with ease and keeping the reader interested in learning the science and caring about the people. She does this all while doing her best to avoid passing judgment or creating villains. Like a good journalist, she simply reports the facts of a fantastically and seemingly thoroughly researched book and lets the reader interpret them as they will.In all, this is not only a terrific science book that is not afraid to tackle gray areas of ethics and leave them unanswered without getting preachy, not only a gripping human interest story with more than one human we are interested in, but also a socioeconomic look at the educational opportunities and struggles of poor, disadvantaged people across several generations of our country. Most of all though, this is a uniquely American story.*Seeing as how Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World by Liaquat Ahamed won the last Pulitzer for history, perhaps voters should have already had their library cards taken from them because that book was so bad I wouldn't even use it as a doorstop and besmirch the dignity of my door."

225,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,4,"Henrietta Lacks develops cervical cancer is the 1950's, goes into Johns Hopkins Hospital and after a couple of horrific treatments passes away. Her cells are another story, they continued to live on after biopsies of her cancerous tissue was taken without her permission or her family's knowledge and grown in labs to be shipped around the world to test diseases, develop gene therapy, and ultimately change the world. All the while, her children and family had no idea that this was happening, and they struggle to come to terms with what it means to have immortal cells, while the family can barely afford medical treatment.Rebecca Skloot takes a nearly impossible task of researching something that was breaking at the time, and challenges human rights to our own tissue and most importantly how client consent has changed over the past couple of decades. Fascinating story merging the lines of racial and gender discrimination, while also facing class struggles. In my opinion, this book should be required reading."
226,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9554958-sara,1,"The story behind the infamous ""HeLa"" cells are interesting to most scientists, as most of us have either worked with them, read endless research articles/journals utilizing them, and know about their contributions to science and/or medicine, among many more things. This immortal cell line was derived from Mrs. Lacks' cervical tissue, which became cancerous after she was infected with HPV. She recieved treatment for cervical canver at Johns Hopkins University, known at this time period for treating black patients. Though I don't know how her race/ethnicity/social status affected her personal treatment at the hospital, the actual medical treatment for her condition was unbiased and the normal protocol for any one with the condition. During this time period, research physicians, or physicians who were interetsed in biomedical research were striving to culture an immortal cell line, which has enormous applications and implications in biomedical research. The physicians, with the help of other scientists and technicians, were able to create a cell line that had greatly sought-after conditions for the purposes of biomedical research, inlcuding immortalization and ease of growth in culture. The use of her cells greatly impacted the field of biomedical research, and the cultivation and use of the HeLA cell line contributed to the establishment of the first Polio vaccine, cancer research, and countless other types of research where the characteristics of the HeLa cell line offer great advatange and resource for pusuit of scientific knowledge. My review of this book has nothing to do with the contributions her cells have made to the scientific community. The physicians at the time did take her cells and culture them without her consent, but that was standard protocol at the time, and she was not isolated for that purpose. We have all contributed from the use of her cells, therefore, it is hypocritical to be critical of the use of them.Despite a major attempt to create a ""boogey-man"" portrait of the physicians/scientists that worked with her cells, none of them were awarded financially for establishing the HeLa cell line. The author tries to create an image of a poor black woman who was robbed of her cells without consent and not awarded the enormous monentary prize for their use, but the truth is, this was standard procedure at that time period,and her cells just happened to actually work for that purpose. I was very interested to learn more about Mrs. Lacks in this book. What made this book impossible to read was the author. She hardly writes more than a few pages about Mrs. Lacks. She mostly wrote a biography detailing her attempts at finding information, without providing anything insightful about the actual woman it was supposed to be about, Mrs. Lacks. Most of the book is about her relatives and their immense anger and resentment about not being compensated for the use of Mrs. Lacks' cells. I don't really give a shit about that. A lot of shitty things happen to people in this world, this wasn't in any way the worst, and that would have made a decent book if that was what the book was supposed to be about. This book was so boring, I didn't even finish it. "
227,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"This book has been around for a while now, so most people know the basis. Rebecca Skloot tells the story here of Henrietta Lacks, the poor black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1951. Why do we care about Henrietta Lacks? Quite simply, her cells, which were taken without her knowledge or consent, became known as HeLa cells. Now does it sound familiar? HeLa cells have been around for a while, recognizable to many for their importance in developing the polio vaccine and gene mapping. HeLa cells have survived and grown since 1951.But Skloot recognized there was more to the science than just the letters HeLa. She set out to uncover the truth about the person behind the abbreviation. With the help of members of Lacks's family, Skloot spent about a decade on this book. She visited the now-defunct Clover, where Lacks grew up, she took Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, to the hospital where her sister, Elsie, was put away as an ""imbecile"" and where she died under suspicious circumstances. Deborah, who was four when Henrietta died, was just as committed to finding out the full story about her family as Skloot was.The book bounces around in time, from the 40s and 50s as Skloot detailed Henrietta's life and illness, to ""present day"" of 2009 when the book was published. Skloot's own journey with her research began in the late 90s. She got married and divorced during the writing of this book. She knew Henrietta Lacks was unknown by the public, even though her cells had been such a vital part of medicine and science for decades.The heartbreaking part about this real-life story is that Henrietta's descendants and family knew nothing about the HeLa cells themselves. They were never given any real explanation about the cells, nor were they compensated in any way. The book brings to light a lot of issues, from social to ethical. Most impressive is the concept that all tissue in and on your body belongs to you while it's attached to you, but as soon as it's removed from you, it's not longer ""yours"". You have no rights over it. It can be researched and sold and re-sold and modified and studies. You get no say in whether you want studies on pieces of your body to go towards the cure for cancer or for the creation of atomic bombs or other devices of mass destruction.Years ago I had a cyst removed. Thinking of a Margaret Atwood story, I asked my surgeon (and every subsequent tech and anesthesiologist whom I met prior to surgery) if I could keep my cyst once they excised it. After their initial responses of ""Ew, WHY?"" they told me that would not, could not, should not ever be available to me. ""But it's MINE"" I tried to argue. They claimed liability, and disease (not that I had a disease, but it's jut not sanitary). None of them had read the Atwood story I was referencing, but if they had, they would have been even more adamant that I should be allowed nowhere near the cyst once it had been removed.I've thought about the same thing during a breast biopsy and then more recently, when they removed my thyroid. What are they going to do with it? What I really would like, more than being able to keep these things that have been pulled from my body over the years, is frequent updates about the road my tissues have traveled. Remember in the 90s the popularity of things like adopting a star, or a whale, or a polar bear. You'd get a picture in the mail for the low-cost of whatever, and then a few updates throughout the year about where your whale is and how it is faring.That's what I want with the tissues that have been taken from me. Just a postcard with a picture of what they're doing with my tissues, a little update that says ""ElPa cell was just sold to Norway for the price of 8 million where they will study the effects of cigarette smoking on this tissue taken from your breast in the early 2000s!""As Skloot spent more time with the Lacks family, she became almost a member of the family herself. After the initial periods of suspicion and caution, Skloot was embraced and was called for all the important family births and deaths and other major life experiences. From a personal storytelling point of view, I found that touching, though it wasn't exactly a necessary part of the main story.I suppose really it means that HeLa (Henrietta Lacks) is a part of everyone, brings us all together. She continues to live, and while her family will never see any portion of the proceeds and still have no say over their mother's cells, there's some satisfaction that can be derived from how common the name Henrietta Lacks is now. The woman behind the cells should never be forgotten. Her contributions (that she didn't even know she was making) should be told. She was more than just the abbreviations HeLa.I know everyone has read this book already by this point, but it came up in my little world because I'm now on the Common Reader Committee at the university where I work. At the first meeting, it became obvious that very few of us are actually readers (one went so far as to say he doesn't like to read, which begs the question as to why he was even there). This book was one of my recommendations, even though I hadn't read it yet. My boss read the first six chapters and felt that it would cover a lot of the bases that our university likes to cover, and would appeal to the three main colleges very well by dealing with social justice issues, science and medicine, legality, ethics, and health and wellness.Now that I've read this book on my own I can go back to our meeting next week and say, holy shit guys, this book really does cover ALL the bases. The idea is this would be a book that everyone could read - every student, staff, and faculty member. While the story meanders a bit and gets a bit dry in other places, I think ultimately the story of Henrietta Lacks and her cells will appeal to all readers in the university.But if I hear one more time from anyone ""But are they mature enough for it"" I will scream. College students aren't quite as dumb as everyone likes to think they are. Maybe they're lazy, but cheese and rice, I'm not going to dumb down the Common Reader in concerns that students won't be able to read a book anymore.Plus there's an HBO movie coming out next month based on this book, so if just reading a book isn't incentive enough, maybe Oprah will be.(My other top contenders would be The Handmaid's Tale and March: Book One. Though some on the committee thinks if we give a graphic novel to college students they will think we're giving them ""cartoons"" to read and there may be an uprising. It's fascinating to me how little faculty and staff know the students at their own university. To be fair, those who suggest an uprising are also the ones who don't read, and they claim not to know how to read a graphic novel. Someone asked ""Do you start at the front or the back?"" conflating graphic novels with manga, I believe. This committee will be a long road for me. Someone just put me in charge already.)"
228,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,5,"It reads like good crime fiction. It chronicles the life of the woman whose cancerous tissue became the first tissue in history which could be successfully grown as culture and used in various, and countless, experiments from vaccine research to cloning. Her tissue was so successful in fact that it became virtually immortal, surviving in various environments and proliferating at prodigious rates. Yet, very little was known about the woman herself, her life, her family, her history, and this is what Skloot set out to uncover. What she found out is absolutely stunning from the point of medical ethics, American history and American healthcare. Fascinating. Highly recommended."

I knew a little bit about Henrietta Lacks, but I was definitely not aware of the extent to which her family was affected by the use of her sells in modern day biology. It broke my heart to see how her family, deeply rooted in religious beliefs, was broken because they felt as though Henrietta's soul resided in those cells. I have my own personal opinions about the entire concept of doctors taking medical waste for their own advantages. Nevertheless, what I can say about this issue is that it is stories such as the Tuskegee Experiment and the use of Henrietta's cells that have ultimately made the black community hesitant about wanting to go to doctors. I plan to do more research on this topic and it may be a project that I throw myself into. Hopefully I can find more text that really delves into the black community's experience with the medical field. This really opened my eyes to a lot of issues related to the medical field/industry and I can't wait to read more. "

232,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is required reading for pharmaceutical students at a nearby Oklahoma University where a friend of my daughter goes to college. She told me about this book over Christmas. I can see why it’s required reading. I’m glad it is and I hope it is for medical and research students everywhere.It tells the story of an African American woman, Henrietta Lacks, who went to Johns Hopkins in 1951 for treatment for cervical cancer. Some cancerous cells were removed from her body. This much she knew. The cells were also saved, cultured, and reproduced—without her knowledge or consent—as was common practice at the time. What makes this an amazing story is that Henrietta’s cells have never died from that day until the present, hence the title. They continue to grow and reproduce at a phenomenal rate. They currently exist in laboratories, hospitals and warehouses all over the world; have been used in almost every form of scientific research from the 50’s until now; have gone to space; have been contaminated and caused contamination. The scientific and medical communities owe untold debt to the cells it calls HeLa and yet not one dime of compensation, even in terms of discounted medical care or health insurance has ever been received by any of Henrietta’s numerous descendants. Interestingly enough, they aren’t looking for anything in that way. Now isn’t that refreshing? Rather, in spite of all they have suffered—and indeed this is a book about pain—their focal interest throughout was in finding out what happened to their mother since she died so young, gaining recognition for her and learning what happened to Henrietta’s oldest daughter who died in a ‘hospital for the negro insane’, which was 1950’s terminology.  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks crosses many disciplines and for that reason I expect scientists might skim the vignettes about Henrietta’s children, while those who prefer human interest could find themselves avoiding the technical sections. Virginia Woolf’s Common Readers, however, will positively adore this book! It has everything they look for in the written word. Not only what was just mentioned, but also: the complexities and importance of the ‘tissue issue’, what are the medical, legal, ethical, and other parameters for tissue gathering, storage, research, usage, and compensation. And I commend the author, Rebecca Skloot, a self-proclaimed non-believer for her sensitive handling of the many stressed and stressful events, issues and personalities she encountered concerning matters of faith, morals, and religion.  A very important book to read!  Here is a rather long but fascinating 1998 BBC documentary about Henrietta Lacks and HeLa.  Here is an article which gives some more current info about the Lacks family and the issue of privacy v. tissue donation. "
233,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"Henrietta Lacks, a young African-American mother of five children, died in Baltimore in 1951 from a highly aggressive form of cervical cancer—but more than fifty years after her death, part of her lives on in the form of HeLa, a cell line cultivated from a tissue sample of hers which played a key role in several major scientific and medical breakthroughs. Skloot's book tells Lacks' story, partly to pay tribute to a woman who was forgotten by all but her family for many years despite her importance to medicine; partly in order to examine the complex attendant issues of medical ethics, race and class. Skloot's writing is fluid and accessible, and I learned some things which were shocking though not surprising to me (see the organ retention scandal which broke in Ireland a few years ago). That said, I would have liked for a stronger focus on the ethics and the science aspect of the novel and less on the lives of Lacks' children and other relatives. Skloot's focus on them and on some of the more unpalatable aspects of their lives felt quite voyeuristic to me at points, recounted not because Skloot wanted to examine the effects of the vicious cycle of poverty on people's lives but because it would inject more drama into the book. The author talks at length about the less-than-pure motivations of those who had previously profited from Lacks' cells, and their refusal to compensate Lacks' family in any way, about how she was financing her research with credit cards and student loans—and yet her end-goal was always to acquire a book deal, and her account of her relentless attempts to get in touch with members of the Lacks family made me highly uncomfortable. Much of the latter half of the book dealt with the relationship between Skloot and Deborah, Henrietta Lacks' youngest daughter—again, uncomfortable to read about at several points, and not especially relevant to the book's main thrust. Overall, an interesting read, but I feel that The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks could easily have been edited down to half its length—and focused more on Henrietta because of it."

The weft is the story of a friendship between two women meeting each other on the edge of both their worlds, brought there by Henrietta: her immortality is not simply a series of cells.the narrators are excellent. the pacing is a tiny bit slow, but that works for the direct quotes - and hearing voices in dialect anchors the story in time and place. The voices in this story - the amount of quoted text & speech- keep this story very immediate - with the feel of a good documentary or good fiction.a joy."

I tell you the premise, and that's the book. It just keeps doubling over itself to tell you the same science, the same sad story of the people it affected, and nothing ever really happens. People say things like ""hold on, are you ready for this?"" and then nothing happens. It's the same information over and over. So I'm going to spoil the whole book for you; Henrietta Lacks was a poor syphilitic black woman who married her cousin, had a bunch of kids, and died very young of an aggressive cancer, the cells of which doctors took samples of without asking and then developed into the first 'immortal' cell line, which went on to be used by scientist and doctors around the world. Her descendants are plagued by poverty and bad health. That's it. Now imagine me telling you different versions of that over and over while I also tell you about how I'm researching and writing about it, dealing with this difficult and suspicious relatives. That's the book. "

Henrietta Lacks was a poor black women who cells were taken without her consent and used by many scientists to develop vaccines,cloning, and many more things. Unfortunately her family was very poor and never received any money from her cells being used.They had many health problems and could not afford health insurance and died young as a result. I learned a lot of interesting facts while reading this book. "

238,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"Its a very important story, its unique in its format of that the cells of Henrietta lacks are doing and how it seems that even today nobody understand why or how those cells are even still alive, BUT sadly the actual story of doctors doing something without permission is NOT a unique one, since sadly there are still today patients being used without their knowledge -as it is even stated in the book itself. And i think that especially that is something that should be taking away from this book: This story is important and interesting, but so far not much has changed in the medical field so that this type of thing does not continues to happen without permission from the patients themselves. This book does point out quiet a lot of positive things that happened because and with cells and how it could have never happened without them. Some horrendous things, some wonderful things where achieved thanks to those cells and with that thanks to Henrietta Lacks. And i am defiantly one of the first people to point out that medical advances are necessary and that we still have way to little knowledge and actual solutions for way to man illnesses! But i think that this book also points out two very important things and drives them home quiet nicely: 1. Human tissue was once part of a person!We all should respect that. Yes its important that a lot of different science fields have access to tissue samples. But its also important to remember the people that gave those samples. Be it willingly, unwillingly, during life or after their death, it was once part of a living breathing person! I think a lot of us prefer to ignore that, or try to forget it and i think that is defiantly one thing we all should work on always remembering when we take any kind of medicine without a second thought! 2. there are lot of loopholes legally that should be worked on!All this talk of ""technically it wasn't required"" in this book just made me want to shake someone! What it comes down to in very basic forms -especially in regards of this specific book and the story it tells- is that everyone should be asking for permission. Doctors and scientists should explain in understandable terms what they want and why it could be helpful and i am pretty sure that a lot of people -especially those with illnesses!- will be more than willing to hand out tissue samples for further use! No need to just take them without asking! So why do it?Which brings it all back to the first point: lets not forget all those ""samples"" actually come from someone that is not just there to be a lab-rat!Now the one ""negative"" thing of this book is that i personally didn't really like how the Skloot wrote this book. Some sections felt as if she wanted to get that particular part of the story told and done with as fast as possible and shoved a lot of details and information into a pretty small section and number of pages. And than sometimes she would go on and on about some things for endless number of pages that i personally felt that it wasn't necessary to go on about it for that long. To say it short it is not he best nonfiction writing i have read. BUT its also far from the worst. Its very readable and yes it could have been kept a little shorter, but all in all it was done pretty well in the writing department. of course that is completely personal and some of the reviews i read LOVED the writing, so clearly that part is debatable.If you are interested in this book, defiantly give it a try. If you are going into a scientific field? Defiantly read this!"
239,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,"A book like this makes me realize how important education in general and particularly science education is. Today’s science is yesterday’s magic—for those who don’t understand science, it can seem like very frightening black magic. The story of Henrietta Lacks explores the intersection between science, research, education, capitalism, civil rights, and consent.The major question implicit in this book is whether we have any claim to our own cells after they have been removed from our bodies. Is it ethical to take “discarded” cells—those left over after medical procedures—and do research from them and potentially make money from either the cells or the research. This issue gets us down somewhere in our irrational subconscious—after all, we all “know” enough about voodoo and black magic to know that curses require hair, nail clippings, blood, or other bodily secretions in order to be effective. In many ways, the story of the HeLa cell line traces the history of medical research in the US (and to some extent, other countries), evolving from the exploitation of vulnerable people towards the concept of informed consent. It also traces the history of an African American family, liberated from slavery, but not from poverty and deprivation. The current distrust of science has some real roots in situations like these, where people were used without their knowledge for experimental purposes. But the lack of scientific literacy in the general population helps with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and the prevalence of medical quackery. Witness all the “miracle cures” that people buy into. One older lady that I used to work with was always pouring money into some miracle weight loss scheme or another—it didn’t seem to occur to her that if the method actually worked, it would be front page news on Time magazine, not some obscure ad in the back of a newspaper.We have to seriously question ourselves and our politicians about the quality of our educational systems. Are they being funded? Do we have enough teachers? Can poor children hope to get education equal to that of rich children?As my grandfather used to say, no education is wasted."
240,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,5,"Henrietta Lacks is a woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951. The cells cut from her body, because of their aptitude for growth and replication, still play a significant role in treating disease and other medical tests. She did not know her cells were being used, and her family did not benefit financially. The author writes extensively about her family, as they were a crucial source for the book. Because of so many trust relationships violated over the years, she had to first work to build trust and prove herself reliable. She went on to establish a trust for the family.This book discusses science, both the present state of medicine while Henrietta was being treated for cervical cancer (nothing short of radium tube inserts and lead!) and how science has grown in its understandings and treatments because of her cells. The book has to address the ways African Americans have been treated badly by the American medical establishment from Tuskagee to forced sterilizations, to even some patients injected with Henrietta's cells without their knowledge! I felt like I knew much of the story already, but only because this book has received so much acclaim and press, and I find rightly so. I'm not a scientist but felt I could understand it as Skloot presented the information.I also learned some terrifying things that don't soothe my paranoia. Huge government stores of cells that no longer belong to you - not owning the rights to your bodily tissue - still all true in the 21st century. Ever wonder where your blood, teeth, etc. got to? Ha. I read this during Banned Books Week 2015 because earlier this year it was challenged by a Tennessee mother who felt it was ""pornographic."" The woman had cervical cancer, cancer of the CERVIX, a body part all women have. Oh please. This book isn't pornography, it's science. Discussed on Episode 042 of the Reading Envy Podcast."
241,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186579-kate,1,"This book irritated me from the beginning. It couldn't decide if it was a history of the cells, the life story of one woman, a chronicle of how an author tracks down the life story of a woman, a position paper on racism, a position paper on human tissue ownership, or a position paper on disorganized rhetoric. I think it was all of those, and it drove me absolutely up the wall.As a history of the HeLa cells ... I read a Wired article that was better.As the life story of Henrietta Lacks ... it read like a list of facts instead of a human interest piece. And it kept going on tangents (with the life stories of each of her children, her doctors, etc.)As the story of the author tracking down a story ... that was actually kind of interesting.As a position paper on racism...it had a lot of disturbing stories - but no cohesive point.As a position paper on human tissue ownership... the best chapter was the last one, which actually listed facts and laws. And while the author clearly had an opinion in that chapter -it was more focused and less full of unrelated stories intended to pull on your hearts strings and shift your opinion.As a position paper on disorganized rhetoric...it was a stellar exemplar."
242,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"I don't know how many copies of a book need to be sold before it can be fairly described as a best-seller. In any case what kind of bearing does the number of copies sold have on the amount that a book is read? The success of Rebecca Skloot's book is maybe entirely unsurprising as it covers a wide range of angles and caters for many tastes. It has something of the ever popular misery mémoire, some social history, an investigative aspect with detective road trips, along with an exploration of one of the wonders of modern science. All of this comes together in two alternating narrative strands, the death of Henrietta Lacks from cancer and the strange ongoing life and use of a tissue sample collected from her that has been used for a host of purposes from cancer research to gene mapping to assessing human sensitivity to commercial products, as well as the impact of her life and death on her young family. As a whole it was a moving reading experience.The story told is a very simple one, and I found how it is told completely effective. It is not surprising that some forms of cancer, even with treatment, are fatal. It is not surprising that poor black people in the USA remain poor over time, it is not surprising that difficult childhood experiences can overshadow later adult lives, it is even not surprising that something if not entirely free to obtain like the tissue sample in question, has come to be a source of profit for many companies while providing no benefit to either the donor’s family nor the institution which provided Henrietta Lacks with medical treatment and collected the sample in the first place. Perhaps part of the success of Skloot's narration is just how unsurprising those elements of the story are juxtaposed with the completely unexpected survival and continuing life of Henrietta Lacks' tissue sample. There is a recognisable slice of life married with something unique so far in science and of enduring scientific impact.For me the most serious downside is that I had the feeling that Skloot had hoped her book might start a public debate on issues of sample ownership, but so far that discussion so far has not escaped the courts. That leaves us with a great piece of non-fiction writing rather than a rallying cry for change."
243,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,5,"In reading non-fiction, and particularly scientific non-fiction, my two most frequent gripes are: a lack of personal story, and a lack of overall narrative. It's my opinion that just because a work isn't fiction, it shouldn't miss out on the use of structural elements more common to fiction: a strong narrative and narrative structure can improve any kind of communication.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a near-flawless implementation of this. The book has three components: the story of Henrietta and her family, the story of the science made possible by Henrietta, and the story of the author, Skloot, researching the book. I can't stress enough how effectively these three threads are woven together, making a educational, intersectional, and ultimately tragic story. If you are interested in the human side of scientific advance then this is an absolute, absolute must-read. Highly recommended."

They turned out to be very essential to modern medical advancements.I found this to be an interesting book, mainly because it taught me a few science/medical bits, and it made me think more deeply about ethical issues related to tissue ownership. As always, I enjoyed the close-up views of racial issues.I'm glad that the author wrote this book, as I'm sure it helped Henrietta's family understand what really took place all those years ago. It also makes all of us aware of the debt we owe to Henrietta.4 Stars = Outstanding. It definitely held my interest."
245,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5036644-meredith-o-donnell,2,"Interesting concept. Reading it with my book club... Upate: Finished. I am always up for a rousing ethical debate. The deplorable breach of privacy, a basic human right, displayed in the book was appalling. Anyone who has ever been dehumanized can relate to the way Henrietta was objectified for the sake of science. It was beyond unconscionable. I am glad the story was told. I hope that Skloot's efforts will remind the industry of science and medicine that they need to be held accountable for their actions, and the finished product is not the only thing that matters, but the methods taken on their road to discovery count as well. Henrietta's cells have provided mankind with a lot to be grateful for, and for that we must thank the scientists and doctors who worked feverishly and masterfully, experimenting and coming up with new ideas. However, the people behind the cells have rights too. Bioethics have come a long way since the 1950's, but there are still flaws.  I learned in several journalism courses I took in college that the job of the journalist is to hold accountable those who serve the public--be it in politics, consumerism, or medicine. That is what Skloot has done by tackling the story of Henrietta Lacks--the person behind the immortal HeLa cell line. For that, I commend her. While I agreed with the endeavor, I had a few issues with her strategy. As others have mentioned, she placed herself in the story excessively. She claimed it was necessary, but I doubt if it was necessary to the extent that she did it. She seemed to want to constantly remind the reader of her plight. This is not the place of a journalist--just tell the story, don't tell your own story of getting the story. Also, she had an incredibly obvious bias, and a suspiciously not-so-obvious agenda. I did question Skloot's intentions. She spoke as an advocate for the Lacks family, but I do wonder whether or not she was a welcomed one, or a useful one.  She classifies the book as nonfiction upfront. And that it is. Or was intended to be... the story is real. But the details were so convoluted, shrouded and murky that it became difficult to truly believe with any authority one thing or the other. For instance, Skloot admits that the medical field was not proficient in recording things during this time (no computer.) Consequently, a lot of important details concerning Henrietta's illness, diagnosis, the retrieval of her cells, her death, her autopsy, her burial, among other factors, were not clearly documented. Also, Skloot's main sources of information were the Lacks family--a family frought with incest, disease, mental illness, partial deafness, drug abuse, a lack of intelligence and a lack of education--none of which was their fault, but all of which made them unreliable sources of information. For instance-- did Henrietta ever meet Gey? His assistant Mary swears yes. But Dave Lacks says absolutely not. The tie breaker is dead..and was on her death bed/twisted with pain/heavily medicated during the time of the alleged meeting so it is not out of the realm of possibilities that she either forgot about the encounter or didn't think to bring it up. It's also just as possible that Mary was confused (no documentation,) or was lying. I have no reason to believe one over the other. Also, Joe's murder. Skloot decided to present the family's convenient recollection of events authoritatively--that it was self defense. However, a witness testified under oath that the fatal attack was unprovoked. Again, I have no incentive to take one side over the other, but Skloot's selective storytelling contributed to my distrust of her as a narrator, a writer and a reporter.  When I read a nonfiction piece, I prefer for the facts to be indisputable. Aside from credibility issues, I also questioned Skloot's true motives. She hid behind an ultra-liberal facade: a sympathetic crusader who was empowering this poor, uneducated family with the voice they never had. But notice how she proudly boasts of a deep friendship with Deborah Lacks in the beginning of the book... but I wonder if Deborah, God rest her soul, would confirm this claim. We'll never know. Skloot seemed to pester the family, while at the same time condemning those who did the same...as if her reasons were more pure and justifiable. She also clearly lamented their lack of medical coverage and financial compensation, and a portion of the proceeds for the book will go to a scholarship fund for the family, but why didn't she just write them a big check? They didn't benefit directly. If you read closely, Skloot reveals that she had to agree to certain conditions before the Lacks family would agree to talk to her. She had to tell the family's story exactly the way it was told to her, whether facts were verified or not. She was so desperate to satisfy, what started out as her own morbid curiosity, and grew into an obsessive mission, that she agreed to this stipulation. That almost concealed little tidbit, combined with the unreliability and untrustworthiness of the medical profession during that time, left this reader skeptical of nearly every word. However, the subject matter and her insistance to reinstate the human side to a research subject, as well as the fact that Skloot manages to make very technical terminology and notions perfectly clear to a former B student in Biology, earn the writer one star each. I recommend reading along side Oliver Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat-- another nonfiction piece about the humanization of patients. Meredith O'Donnell"
246,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is fascinating and heartbreaking in equal measure. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Before she died, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in cultures for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory. Those cells, known as HeLa, are still alive today and have advanced medicine and science in countless ways; it seems there's no end to the list of discoveries made because of HeLa.I've tried to imagine how [Henrietta would] feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. Henrietta's cells helped launch the fledgling field of virology. As the Cold War escalated, some scientists exposed Henrietta's cells to massive doses of radiation to study how nuclear bombs destroyed cells and find ways to reverse that damage. Others put them in special centrifuges that spun so fast the pressure inside was more than 100,000 times that of gravity, to see what happened to human cells under the extreme conditions of deep-sea diving or spaceflight. The author took great care to learn about Henrietta Lacks. She paints Henrietta as a woman who accepted her illness and faced her treatment with unparalleled resilience and strength. One afternoon, as Henrietta lay on the couch, she lifted her shirt to show Margaret and Sadie what the treatments had done to her. Sadie gasped: The skin from Henrietta's breasts to her pelvis was charred a deep black from the radiation. The rest of her body was its normal shade -- more the color of fawn than coal. ""Hennie,"" she whispered, ""they burn you black as tar."" Henrietta just nodded and said, ""Lord, it just feels like that blackness be spreadin all inside me."" Cancer is a foul creature, sinister and terrifying, but Henrietta's cancer was a force of evil from the nadir of Hell. It ravaged her body in unmerciful ways; it's no wonder those cells survived in a test tube where all other cells died. Suddenly [Henrietta's] body went rigid as a board. She screamed as the nurse ran to the bed, tightening the straps around Henrietta's arms and legs to keep her from thrashing onto the floor as she'd done many times before. Gladys thrust the pillow from her lap into Henrietta's mouth, to keep her from biting her tongue as she convulsed in pain. The book is extensive; all of the information is efficiently organized and comprehensive. Part of what makes this book so tantalizing are all of the near-misses, all of the moments when the author was turned down in her quest to learn the truth about Henrietta Lacks. Had she given up, as so many others did, Henrietta Lacks might have been forgotten and this riveting book would have never existed. "
247,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6942006-suzy,5,"I was completely in the thrall of author Rebecca Skloot while listening to the audio of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. This is at once a scientific story of Henrietta's cancer cells, called HeLa, which were harvested from her as she was dying from cervical cancer in 1951. These are the first human cells to become ""immortal"", perpetuating themselves even to today, and being used in many important health discoveries including polio vaccines, in vitro fertilization, aids research, cancer drugs and too many others to mention. It is also the story of Henrietta and her family, who had no idea that their mother's cells were taken or the importance of the cells to medicine. Her children learn about this from Skloot's research and this knowledge causes misunderstandings and various reactions in Henrietta's adult children from some wanting financial remuneration to others just wanting their mother to be honored and respected for her contribution to science. My heart went out to Henrietta and her family who, because they were poor and black, were treated, and lived, as second class citizens. They are often at the mercy of their many health problems through lack of education, lack of access to health insurance and suspicions about the medical establishment. It seems so unjust! (Thanks to GR friend Will Byrnes for posting this NY Times article on the consent agreement reached with the family finally . . . 62 years later. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/sci...)At first I found the structure of the book a little frustrating because it jumped in both time and storyline, but once I decided to just flow with it, I was completely engaged. I think listening helped. It was as if the author was telling her story just to me, and that I was discovering it side-by-side with her. There are so many layers, that my thought is there's something to connect to for everyone based on a reader's interests coming to the book. Skloot reveals early in the book that she learned about HeLa in a biology class when she was younger and decided then and there to research and write about them. Little did she know that she would be telling the story of the Lacks family right along with the scientific importance of the cells. I appreciated the interview at the end of the audio where Skloot tells us how she decided on the focus and the structure of the book. This was the February book club pick at our wonderful art museum here in Minneapolis, and I enjoyed the discussion. I'm eagerly anticipating the HBO movie based on the book which will be aired April 22 here in the States. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5686132/"

The list of her contributions to science go on and on.Henrietta’s cells were taken without her permission or knowledge in early 1951. More than twenty years would pass before her family ever found out. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is Henrietta’s story, the story of her cell’s contribution to science, and the story of her family.

The fact that her family can't even get reliable health insurance really just adds insult to injury. This is a well-researched, well-written book. The issue it discusses is extremely important, and the last chapter about tissue ownership is outright terrifying. It was the first time I heard of ""gene patents"" (what?), and this:Myriad Genetics, which holds the patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes responsible for most cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, charges $3,000 to test for the genes. Myriad has been accused of creating a monopoly, since no one else can offer the test, and researchers can’t develop cheaper tests or new therapies without getting permission from Myriad and paying steep licensing fees. Scientists who’ve gone ahead with research involving the breast-cancer genes without Myriad’s permission have found themselves on the receiving end of cease-and-desist letters and threats of litigation.I don't know what to say. I think this paragraph sums it up very well:
The debate over the commercialization of human biological materials always comes back to one fundamental point: like it or not, we live in a market-driven society, and science is part of that market. Baruch Blumberg, the Nobel Prize-winning researcher who used Ted Slavin’s antibodies for hepatitis B research, told me, “Whether you think the commercialization of medical research is good or bad depends on how into capitalism you are.” On the whole, Blumberg said, commercialization is good; how else would we get the drugs and diagnostic tests we need? Still, he sees a downside. “I think it’s fair to say it’s interfered with science,” he said. “It’s changed the spirit.” Now there are patents and proprietary information where there once was free information flow. “Researchers have become entrepreneurs. That’s boomed our economy and created incentives to do research. But it’s also brought problems, like secrecy and arguments over who owns what.”
"
253,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,5,"This is a phenomenal book. If it doesn't win every non-fiction award for 2010 than whoever votes for non-fiction awards should have their library cards taken away from them*.The author, Rebecca Skloot, does a masterful job of seamlessly weaving in the scientific story of Henrietta Lacks' immortal cells and the effect they have had on medicine and medical ethics with a real human interest story about Henrietta and the struggles of her family. Skloot does this without coming across as maudlin, preachy, overly technical, guilt ridden, condescending, or just plain boring. She deftly weaves two legs of one story together, darting in and out with ease and keeping the reader interested in learning the science and caring about the people. She does this all while doing her best to avoid passing judgment or creating villains. Like a good journalist, she simply reports the facts of a fantastically and seemingly thoroughly researched book and lets the reader interpret them as they will.In all, this is not only a terrific science book that is not afraid to tackle gray areas of ethics and leave them unanswered without getting preachy, not only a gripping human interest story with more than one human we are interested in, but also a socioeconomic look at the educational opportunities and struggles of poor, disadvantaged people across several generations of our country. Most of all though, this is a uniquely American story.*Seeing as how Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World by Liaquat Ahamed won the last Pulitzer for history, perhaps voters should have already had their library cards taken from them because that book was so bad I wouldn't even use it as a doorstop and besmirch the dignity of my door."

Her cells are another story, they continued to live on after biopsies of her cancerous tissue was taken without her permission or her family's knowledge and grown in labs to be shipped around the world to test diseases, develop gene therapy, and ultimately change the world. All the while, her children and family had no idea that this was happening, and they struggle to come to terms with what it means to have immortal cells, while the family can barely afford medical treatment.Rebecca Skloot takes a nearly impossible task of researching something that was breaking at the time, and challenges human rights to our own tissue and most importantly how client consent has changed over the past couple of decades. Fascinating story merging the lines of racial and gender discrimination, while also facing class struggles. In my opinion, this book should be required reading."
256,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9554958-sara,1,"The story behind the infamous ""HeLa"" cells are interesting to most scientists, as most of us have either worked with them, read endless research articles/journals utilizing them, and know about their contributions to science and/or medicine, among many more things. This immortal cell line was derived from Mrs. Lacks' cervical tissue, which became cancerous after she was infected with HPV. She recieved treatment for cervical canver at Johns Hopkins University, known at this time period for treating black patients. Though I don't know how her race/ethnicity/social status affected her personal treatment at the hospital, the actual medical treatment for her condition was unbiased and the normal protocol for any one with the condition. During this time period, research physicians, or physicians who were interetsed in biomedical research were striving to culture an immortal cell line, which has enormous applications and implications in biomedical research. The physicians, with the help of other scientists and technicians, were able to create a cell line that had greatly sought-after conditions for the purposes of biomedical research, inlcuding immortalization and ease of growth in culture. The use of her cells greatly impacted the field of biomedical research, and the cultivation and use of the HeLA cell line contributed to the establishment of the first Polio vaccine, cancer research, and countless other types of research where the characteristics of the HeLa cell line offer great advatange and resource for pusuit of scientific knowledge. My review of this book has nothing to do with the contributions her cells have made to the scientific community. The physicians at the time did take her cells and culture them without her consent, but that was standard protocol at the time, and she was not isolated for that purpose. We have all contributed from the use of her cells, therefore, it is hypocritical to be critical of the use of them.Despite a major attempt to create a ""boogey-man"" portrait of the physicians/scientists that worked with her cells, none of them were awarded financially for establishing the HeLa cell line. The author tries to create an image of a poor black woman who was robbed of her cells without consent and not awarded the enormous monentary prize for their use, but the truth is, this was standard procedure at that time period,and her cells just happened to actually work for that purpose. I was very interested to learn more about Mrs. Lacks in this book. What made this book impossible to read was the author. She hardly writes more than a few pages about Mrs. Lacks. She mostly wrote a biography detailing her attempts at finding information, without providing anything insightful about the actual woman it was supposed to be about, Mrs. Lacks. Most of the book is about her relatives and their immense anger and resentment about not being compensated for the use of Mrs. Lacks' cells. I don't really give a shit about that. A lot of shitty things happen to people in this world, this wasn't in any way the worst, and that would have made a decent book if that was what the book was supposed to be about. This book was so boring, I didn't even finish it. "
257,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"This book has been around for a while now, so most people know the basis. Rebecca Skloot tells the story here of Henrietta Lacks, the poor black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1951. Why do we care about Henrietta Lacks? Quite simply, her cells, which were taken without her knowledge or consent, became known as HeLa cells. Now does it sound familiar? HeLa cells have been around for a while, recognizable to many for their importance in developing the polio vaccine and gene mapping. HeLa cells have survived and grown since 1951.But Skloot recognized there was more to the science than just the letters HeLa. She set out to uncover the truth about the person behind the abbreviation. With the help of members of Lacks's family, Skloot spent about a decade on this book. She visited the now-defunct Clover, where Lacks grew up, she took Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, to the hospital where her sister, Elsie, was put away as an ""imbecile"" and where she died under suspicious circumstances. Deborah, who was four when Henrietta died, was just as committed to finding out the full story about her family as Skloot was.The book bounces around in time, from the 40s and 50s as Skloot detailed Henrietta's life and illness, to ""present day"" of 2009 when the book was published. Skloot's own journey with her research began in the late 90s. She got married and divorced during the writing of this book. She knew Henrietta Lacks was unknown by the public, even though her cells had been such a vital part of medicine and science for decades.The heartbreaking part about this real-life story is that Henrietta's descendants and family knew nothing about the HeLa cells themselves. They were never given any real explanation about the cells, nor were they compensated in any way. The book brings to light a lot of issues, from social to ethical. Most impressive is the concept that all tissue in and on your body belongs to you while it's attached to you, but as soon as it's removed from you, it's not longer ""yours"". You have no rights over it. It can be researched and sold and re-sold and modified and studies. You get no say in whether you want studies on pieces of your body to go towards the cure for cancer or for the creation of atomic bombs or other devices of mass destruction.Years ago I had a cyst removed. Thinking of a Margaret Atwood story, I asked my surgeon (and every subsequent tech and anesthesiologist whom I met prior to surgery) if I could keep my cyst once they excised it. After their initial responses of ""Ew, WHY?"" they told me that would not, could not, should not ever be available to me. ""But it's MINE"" I tried to argue. They claimed liability, and disease (not that I had a disease, but it's jut not sanitary). None of them had read the Atwood story I was referencing, but if they had, they would have been even more adamant that I should be allowed nowhere near the cyst once it had been removed.I've thought about the same thing during a breast biopsy and then more recently, when they removed my thyroid. What are they going to do with it? What I really would like, more than being able to keep these things that have been pulled from my body over the years, is frequent updates about the road my tissues have traveled. Remember in the 90s the popularity of things like adopting a star, or a whale, or a polar bear. You'd get a picture in the mail for the low-cost of whatever, and then a few updates throughout the year about where your whale is and how it is faring.That's what I want with the tissues that have been taken from me. Just a postcard with a picture of what they're doing with my tissues, a little update that says ""ElPa cell was just sold to Norway for the price of 8 million where they will study the effects of cigarette smoking on this tissue taken from your breast in the early 2000s!""As Skloot spent more time with the Lacks family, she became almost a member of the family herself. After the initial periods of suspicion and caution, Skloot was embraced and was called for all the important family births and deaths and other major life experiences. From a personal storytelling point of view, I found that touching, though it wasn't exactly a necessary part of the main story.I suppose really it means that HeLa (Henrietta Lacks) is a part of everyone, brings us all together. She continues to live, and while her family will never see any portion of the proceeds and still have no say over their mother's cells, there's some satisfaction that can be derived from how common the name Henrietta Lacks is now. The woman behind the cells should never be forgotten. Her contributions (that she didn't even know she was making) should be told. She was more than just the abbreviations HeLa.I know everyone has read this book already by this point, but it came up in my little world because I'm now on the Common Reader Committee at the university where I work. At the first meeting, it became obvious that very few of us are actually readers (one went so far as to say he doesn't like to read, which begs the question as to why he was even there). This book was one of my recommendations, even though I hadn't read it yet. My boss read the first six chapters and felt that it would cover a lot of the bases that our university likes to cover, and would appeal to the three main colleges very well by dealing with social justice issues, science and medicine, legality, ethics, and health and wellness.Now that I've read this book on my own I can go back to our meeting next week and say, holy shit guys, this book really does cover ALL the bases. The idea is this would be a book that everyone could read - every student, staff, and faculty member. While the story meanders a bit and gets a bit dry in other places, I think ultimately the story of Henrietta Lacks and her cells will appeal to all readers in the university.But if I hear one more time from anyone ""But are they mature enough for it"" I will scream. College students aren't quite as dumb as everyone likes to think they are. Maybe they're lazy, but cheese and rice, I'm not going to dumb down the Common Reader in concerns that students won't be able to read a book anymore.Plus there's an HBO movie coming out next month based on this book, so if just reading a book isn't incentive enough, maybe Oprah will be.(My other top contenders would be The Handmaid's Tale and March: Book One. Though some on the committee thinks if we give a graphic novel to college students they will think we're giving them ""cartoons"" to read and there may be an uprising. It's fascinating to me how little faculty and staff know the students at their own university. To be fair, those who suggest an uprising are also the ones who don't read, and they claim not to know how to read a graphic novel. Someone asked ""Do you start at the front or the back?"" conflating graphic novels with manga, I believe. This committee will be a long road for me. Someone just put me in charge already.)"
258,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,5,"It reads like good crime fiction. It chronicles the life of the woman whose cancerous tissue became the first tissue in history which could be successfully grown as culture and used in various, and countless, experiments from vaccine research to cloning. Her tissue was so successful in fact that it became virtually immortal, surviving in various environments and proliferating at prodigious rates. Yet, very little was known about the woman herself, her life, her family, her history, and this is what Skloot set out to uncover. What she found out is absolutely stunning from the point of medical ethics, American history and American healthcare. Fascinating. Highly recommended."

260,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27544898-bookishrealm,5,"This book was phenomenal in more ways than one. I knew a little bit about Henrietta Lacks, but I was definitely not aware of the extent to which her family was affected by the use of her sells in modern day biology. It broke my heart to see how her family, deeply rooted in religious beliefs, was broken because they felt as though Henrietta's soul resided in those cells. I have my own personal opinions about the entire concept of doctors taking medical waste for their own advantages. Nevertheless, what I can say about this issue is that it is stories such as the Tuskegee Experiment and the use of Henrietta's cells that have ultimately made the black community hesitant about wanting to go to doctors. I plan to do more research on this topic and it may be a project that I throw myself into. Hopefully I can find more text that really delves into the black community's experience with the medical field. This really opened my eyes to a lot of issues related to the medical field/industry and I can't wait to read more. "

I like a book that makes me think, just as I did when I was a college student. There's a fine line between what is ethically/morally ""right"" and that which infringes on a person's own being and that person's (or family of said person) rights to his/her cells. There are never any correct answers or final conclusions in the world of bioethics...it's an ongoing dispute but one that really caused me to question my own decisions and how they are interpreted."
262,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is required reading for pharmaceutical students at a nearby Oklahoma University where a friend of my daughter goes to college. She told me about this book over Christmas. I can see why it’s required reading. I’m glad it is and I hope it is for medical and research students everywhere.It tells the story of an African American woman, Henrietta Lacks, who went to Johns Hopkins in 1951 for treatment for cervical cancer. Some cancerous cells were removed from her body. This much she knew. The cells were also saved, cultured, and reproduced—without her knowledge or consent—as was common practice at the time. What makes this an amazing story is that Henrietta’s cells have never died from that day until the present, hence the title. They continue to grow and reproduce at a phenomenal rate. They currently exist in laboratories, hospitals and warehouses all over the world; have been used in almost every form of scientific research from the 50’s until now; have gone to space; have been contaminated and caused contamination. The scientific and medical communities owe untold debt to the cells it calls HeLa and yet not one dime of compensation, even in terms of discounted medical care or health insurance has ever been received by any of Henrietta’s numerous descendants. Interestingly enough, they aren’t looking for anything in that way. Now isn’t that refreshing? Rather, in spite of all they have suffered—and indeed this is a book about pain—their focal interest throughout was in finding out what happened to their mother since she died so young, gaining recognition for her and learning what happened to Henrietta’s oldest daughter who died in a ‘hospital for the negro insane’, which was 1950’s terminology.  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks crosses many disciplines and for that reason I expect scientists might skim the vignettes about Henrietta’s children, while those who prefer human interest could find themselves avoiding the technical sections. Virginia Woolf’s Common Readers, however, will positively adore this book! It has everything they look for in the written word. Not only what was just mentioned, but also: the complexities and importance of the ‘tissue issue’, what are the medical, legal, ethical, and other parameters for tissue gathering, storage, research, usage, and compensation. And I commend the author, Rebecca Skloot, a self-proclaimed non-believer for her sensitive handling of the many stressed and stressful events, issues and personalities she encountered concerning matters of faith, morals, and religion.  A very important book to read!  Here is a rather long but fascinating 1998 BBC documentary about Henrietta Lacks and HeLa.  Here is an article which gives some more current info about the Lacks family and the issue of privacy v. tissue donation. "
263,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"Henrietta Lacks, a young African-American mother of five children, died in Baltimore in 1951 from a highly aggressive form of cervical cancer—but more than fifty years after her death, part of her lives on in the form of HeLa, a cell line cultivated from a tissue sample of hers which played a key role in several major scientific and medical breakthroughs. Skloot's book tells Lacks' story, partly to pay tribute to a woman who was forgotten by all but her family for many years despite her importance to medicine; partly in order to examine the complex attendant issues of medical ethics, race and class. Skloot's writing is fluid and accessible, and I learned some things which were shocking though not surprising to me (see the organ retention scandal which broke in Ireland a few years ago). That said, I would have liked for a stronger focus on the ethics and the science aspect of the novel and less on the lives of Lacks' children and other relatives. Skloot's focus on them and on some of the more unpalatable aspects of their lives felt quite voyeuristic to me at points, recounted not because Skloot wanted to examine the effects of the vicious cycle of poverty on people's lives but because it would inject more drama into the book. The author talks at length about the less-than-pure motivations of those who had previously profited from Lacks' cells, and their refusal to compensate Lacks' family in any way, about how she was financing her research with credit cards and student loans—and yet her end-goal was always to acquire a book deal, and her account of her relentless attempts to get in touch with members of the Lacks family made me highly uncomfortable. Much of the latter half of the book dealt with the relationship between Skloot and Deborah, Henrietta Lacks' youngest daughter—again, uncomfortable to read about at several points, and not especially relevant to the book's main thrust. Overall, an interesting read, but I feel that The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks could easily have been edited down to half its length—and focused more on Henrietta because of it."
264,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/925949-jude,5,"it's as if the writer wanted the story the way i would want it, and self-observes the arc of her own education the way i would, so the emotional style resonated at a profound level: a combination of passion, humility & fearlessness that makes me trust the her completely, that makes me grateful she is the person who chose this story - or that it chose her.& then there's the story - the science. the race & class issues, the muck of medical ethics before patients were real people and blackfolk were real patients... that's the warp. The weft is the story of a friendship between two women meeting each other on the edge of both their worlds, brought there by Henrietta: her immortality is not simply a series of cells.the narrators are excellent. the pacing is a tiny bit slow, but that works for the direct quotes - and hearing voices in dialect anchors the story in time and place. The voices in this story - the amount of quoted text & speech- keep this story very immediate - with the feel of a good documentary or good fiction.a joy."
265,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3214537-sequoia-m,2,"I had heard so much about this book and was so excited to read it . . . but there's not much to read. I tell you the premise, and that's the book. It just keeps doubling over itself to tell you the same science, the same sad story of the people it affected, and nothing ever really happens. People say things like ""hold on, are you ready for this?"" and then nothing happens. It's the same information over and over. So I'm going to spoil the whole book for you; Henrietta Lacks was a poor syphilitic black woman who married her cousin, had a bunch of kids, and died very young of an aggressive cancer, the cells of which doctors took samples of without asking and then developed into the first 'immortal' cell line, which went on to be used by scientist and doctors around the world. Her descendants are plagued by poverty and bad health. That's it. Now imagine me telling you different versions of that over and over while I also tell you about how I'm researching and writing about it, dealing with this difficult and suspicious relatives. That's the book. "

Henrietta Lacks was a poor black women who cells were taken without her consent and used by many scientists to develop vaccines,cloning, and many more things. Unfortunately her family was very poor and never received any money from her cells being used.They had many health problems and could not afford health insurance and died young as a result.

268,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"Its a very important story, its unique in its format of that the cells of Henrietta lacks are doing and how it seems that even today nobody understand why or how those cells are even still alive, BUT sadly the actual story of doctors doing something without permission is NOT a unique one, since sadly there are still today patients being used without their knowledge -as it is even stated in the book itself. And i think that especially that is something that should be taking away from this book: This story is important and interesting, but so far not much has changed in the medical field so that this type of thing does not continues to happen without permission from the patients themselves. This book does point out quiet a lot of positive things that happened because and with cells and how it could have never happened without them. Some horrendous things, some wonderful things where achieved thanks to those cells and with that thanks to Henrietta Lacks. And i am defiantly one of the first people to point out that medical advances are necessary and that we still have way to little knowledge and actual solutions for way to man illnesses! But i think that this book also points out two very important things and drives them home quiet nicely: 1. Human tissue was once part of a person!We all should respect that. Yes its important that a lot of different science fields have access to tissue samples. But its also important to remember the people that gave those samples. Be it willingly, unwillingly, during life or after their death, it was once part of a living breathing person! I think a lot of us prefer to ignore that, or try to forget it and i think that is defiantly one thing we all should work on always remembering when we take any kind of medicine without a second thought! 2. there are lot of loopholes legally that should be worked on!All this talk of ""technically it wasn't required"" in this book just made me want to shake someone! What it comes down to in very basic forms -especially in regards of this specific book and the story it tells- is that everyone should be asking for permission. Doctors and scientists should explain in understandable terms what they want and why it could be helpful and i am pretty sure that a lot of people -especially those with illnesses!- will be more than willing to hand out tissue samples for further use! No need to just take them without asking! So why do it?Which brings it all back to the first point: lets not forget all those ""samples"" actually come from someone that is not just there to be a lab-rat!Now the one ""negative"" thing of this book is that i personally didn't really like how the Skloot wrote this book. Some sections felt as if she wanted to get that particular part of the story told and done with as fast as possible and shoved a lot of details and information into a pretty small section and number of pages. And than sometimes she would go on and on about some things for endless number of pages that i personally felt that it wasn't necessary to go on about it for that long. To say it short it is not he best nonfiction writing i have read. BUT its also far from the worst. Its very readable and yes it could have been kept a little shorter, but all in all it was done pretty well in the writing department. of course that is completely personal and some of the reviews i read LOVED the writing, so clearly that part is debatable.If you are interested in this book, defiantly give it a try. If you are going into a scientific field? Defiantly read this!"
269,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,"A book like this makes me realize how important education in general and particularly science education is. Today’s science is yesterday’s magic—for those who don’t understand science, it can seem like very frightening black magic. The story of Henrietta Lacks explores the intersection between science, research, education, capitalism, civil rights, and consent.The major question implicit in this book is whether we have any claim to our own cells after they have been removed from our bodies. Is it ethical to take “discarded” cells—those left over after medical procedures—and do research from them and potentially make money from either the cells or the research. This issue gets us down somewhere in our irrational subconscious—after all, we all “know” enough about voodoo and black magic to know that curses require hair, nail clippings, blood, or other bodily secretions in order to be effective. In many ways, the story of the HeLa cell line traces the history of medical research in the US (and to some extent, other countries), evolving from the exploitation of vulnerable people towards the concept of informed consent. It also traces the history of an African American family, liberated from slavery, but not from poverty and deprivation. The current distrust of science has some real roots in situations like these, where people were used without their knowledge for experimental purposes. But the lack of scientific literacy in the general population helps with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and the prevalence of medical quackery. Witness all the “miracle cures” that people buy into. One older lady that I used to work with was always pouring money into some miracle weight loss scheme or another—it didn’t seem to occur to her that if the method actually worked, it would be front page news on Time magazine, not some obscure ad in the back of a newspaper.We have to seriously question ourselves and our politicians about the quality of our educational systems. Are they being funded? Do we have enough teachers? Can poor children hope to get education equal to that of rich children?As my grandfather used to say, no education is wasted."
270,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,5,"Henrietta Lacks is a woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951. The cells cut from her body, because of their aptitude for growth and replication, still play a significant role in treating disease and other medical tests. She did not know her cells were being used, and her family did not benefit financially. The author writes extensively about her family, as they were a crucial source for the book. Because of so many trust relationships violated over the years, she had to first work to build trust and prove herself reliable. She went on to establish a trust for the family.This book discusses science, both the present state of medicine while Henrietta was being treated for cervical cancer (nothing short of radium tube inserts and lead!) and how science has grown in its understandings and treatments because of her cells. The book has to address the ways African Americans have been treated badly by the American medical establishment from Tuskagee to forced sterilizations, to even some patients injected with Henrietta's cells without their knowledge! I felt like I knew much of the story already, but only because this book has received so much acclaim and press, and I find rightly so. I'm not a scientist but felt I could understand it as Skloot presented the information.I also learned some terrifying things that don't soothe my paranoia. Huge government stores of cells that no longer belong to you - not owning the rights to your bodily tissue - still all true in the 21st century. Ever wonder where your blood, teeth, etc. got to? Ha. I read this during Banned Books Week 2015 because earlier this year it was challenged by a Tennessee mother who felt it was ""pornographic."" The woman had cervical cancer, cancer of the CERVIX, a body part all women have. Oh please. This book isn't pornography, it's science. Discussed on Episode 042 of the Reading Envy Podcast."

It couldn't decide if it was a history of the cells, the life story of one woman, a chronicle of how an author tracks down the life story of a woman, a position paper on racism, a position paper on human tissue ownership, or a position paper on disorganized rhetoric. I think it was all of those, and it drove me absolutely up the wall.As a history of the HeLa cells ... I read a Wired article that was better.As the life story of Henrietta Lacks ... it read like a list of facts instead of a human interest piece. And it kept going on tangents (with the life stories of each of her children, her doctors, etc.)As the story of the author tracking down a story ... that was actually kind of interesting.As a position paper on racism...it had a lot of disturbing stories - but no cohesive point.As a position paper on human tissue ownership... the best chapter was the last one, which actually listed facts and laws. And while the author clearly had an opinion in that chapter -it was more focused and less full of unrelated stories intended to pull on your hearts strings and shift your opinion.As a position paper on disorganized rhetoric...it was a stellar exemplar."

In any case what kind of bearing does the number of copies sold have on the amount that a book is read? The success of Rebecca Skloot's book is maybe entirely unsurprising as it covers a wide range of angles and caters for many tastes. It has something of the ever popular misery mémoire, some social history, an investigative aspect with detective road trips, along with an exploration of one of the wonders of modern science. All of this comes together in two alternating narrative strands, the death of Henrietta Lacks from cancer and the strange ongoing life and use of a tissue sample collected from her that has been used for a host of purposes from cancer research to gene mapping to assessing human sensitivity to commercial products, as well as the impact of her life and death on her young family. As a whole it was a moving reading experience.The story told is a very simple one, and I found how it is told completely effective. It is not surprising that some forms of cancer, even with treatment, are fatal. It is not surprising that poor black people in the USA remain poor over time, it is not surprising that difficult childhood experiences can overshadow later adult lives, it is even not surprising that something if not entirely free to obtain like the tissue sample in question, has come to be a source of profit for many companies while providing no benefit to either the donor’s family nor the institution which provided Henrietta Lacks with medical treatment and collected the sample in the first place. Perhaps part of the success of Skloot's narration is just how unsurprising those elements of the story are juxtaposed with the completely unexpected survival and continuing life of Henrietta Lacks' tissue sample. There is a recognisable slice of life married with something unique so far in science and of enduring scientific impact.For me the most serious downside is that I had the feeling that Skloot had hoped her book might start a public debate on issues of sample ownership, but so far that discussion so far has not escaped the courts. That leaves us with a great piece of non-fiction writing rather than a rallying cry for change."
273,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,5,"In reading non-fiction, and particularly scientific non-fiction, my two most frequent gripes are: a lack of personal story, and a lack of overall narrative. It's my opinion that just because a work isn't fiction, it shouldn't miss out on the use of structural elements more common to fiction: a strong narrative and narrative structure can improve any kind of communication.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a near-flawless implementation of this. The book has three components: the story of Henrietta and her family, the story of the science made possible by Henrietta, and the story of the author, Skloot, researching the book. I can't stress enough how effectively these three threads are woven together, making a educational, intersectional, and ultimately tragic story. If you are interested in the human side of scientific advance then this is an absolute, absolute must-read. Highly recommended."
274,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50066399-diane-in-australia,4,"Henrietta was the woman whose cultured cells ... the first to grow and survive indefinitely ... were taken without her knowledge. They turned out to be very essential to modern medical advancements.I found this to be an interesting book, mainly because it taught me a few science/medical bits, and it made me think more deeply about ethical issues related to tissue ownership. As always, I enjoyed the close-up views of racial issues.I'm glad that the author wrote this book, as I'm sure it helped Henrietta's family understand what really took place all those years ago. It also makes all of us aware of the debt we owe to Henrietta.4 Stars = Outstanding. It definitely held my interest."
275,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5036644-meredith-o-donnell,2,"Interesting concept. Reading it with my book club... Upate: Finished. I am always up for a rousing ethical debate. The deplorable breach of privacy, a basic human right, displayed in the book was appalling. Anyone who has ever been dehumanized can relate to the way Henrietta was objectified for the sake of science. It was beyond unconscionable. I am glad the story was told. I hope that Skloot's efforts will remind the industry of science and medicine that they need to be held accountable for their actions, and the finished product is not the only thing that matters, but the methods taken on their road to discovery count as well. Henrietta's cells have provided mankind with a lot to be grateful for, and for that we must thank the scientists and doctors who worked feverishly and masterfully, experimenting and coming up with new ideas. However, the people behind the cells have rights too. Bioethics have come a long way since the 1950's, but there are still flaws.  I learned in several journalism courses I took in college that the job of the journalist is to hold accountable those who serve the public--be it in politics, consumerism, or medicine. That is what Skloot has done by tackling the story of Henrietta Lacks--the person behind the immortal HeLa cell line. For that, I commend her. While I agreed with the endeavor, I had a few issues with her strategy. As others have mentioned, she placed herself in the story excessively. She claimed it was necessary, but I doubt if it was necessary to the extent that she did it. She seemed to want to constantly remind the reader of her plight. This is not the place of a journalist--just tell the story, don't tell your own story of getting the story. Also, she had an incredibly obvious bias, and a suspiciously not-so-obvious agenda. I did question Skloot's intentions. She spoke as an advocate for the Lacks family, but I do wonder whether or not she was a welcomed one, or a useful one.  She classifies the book as nonfiction upfront. And that it is. Or was intended to be... the story is real. But the details were so convoluted, shrouded and murky that it became difficult to truly believe with any authority one thing or the other. For instance, Skloot admits that the medical field was not proficient in recording things during this time (no computer.) Consequently, a lot of important details concerning Henrietta's illness, diagnosis, the retrieval of her cells, her death, her autopsy, her burial, among other factors, were not clearly documented. Also, Skloot's main sources of information were the Lacks family--a family frought with incest, disease, mental illness, partial deafness, drug abuse, a lack of intelligence and a lack of education--none of which was their fault, but all of which made them unreliable sources of information. For instance-- did Henrietta ever meet Gey? His assistant Mary swears yes. But Dave Lacks says absolutely not. The tie breaker is dead..and was on her death bed/twisted with pain/heavily medicated during the time of the alleged meeting so it is not out of the realm of possibilities that she either forgot about the encounter or didn't think to bring it up. It's also just as possible that Mary was confused (no documentation,) or was lying. I have no reason to believe one over the other. Also, Joe's murder. Skloot decided to present the family's convenient recollection of events authoritatively--that it was self defense. However, a witness testified under oath that the fatal attack was unprovoked. Again, I have no incentive to take one side over the other, but Skloot's selective storytelling contributed to my distrust of her as a narrator, a writer and a reporter.  When I read a nonfiction piece, I prefer for the facts to be indisputable. Aside from credibility issues, I also questioned Skloot's true motives. She hid behind an ultra-liberal facade: a sympathetic crusader who was empowering this poor, uneducated family with the voice they never had. But notice how she proudly boasts of a deep friendship with Deborah Lacks in the beginning of the book... but I wonder if Deborah, God rest her soul, would confirm this claim. We'll never know. Skloot seemed to pester the family, while at the same time condemning those who did the same...as if her reasons were more pure and justifiable. She also clearly lamented their lack of medical coverage and financial compensation, and a portion of the proceeds for the book will go to a scholarship fund for the family, but why didn't she just write them a big check? They didn't benefit directly. If you read closely, Skloot reveals that she had to agree to certain conditions before the Lacks family would agree to talk to her. She had to tell the family's story exactly the way it was told to her, whether facts were verified or not. She was so desperate to satisfy, what started out as her own morbid curiosity, and grew into an obsessive mission, that she agreed to this stipulation. That almost concealed little tidbit, combined with the unreliability and untrustworthiness of the medical profession during that time, left this reader skeptical of nearly every word. However, the subject matter and her insistance to reinstate the human side to a research subject, as well as the fact that Skloot manages to make very technical terminology and notions perfectly clear to a former B student in Biology, earn the writer one star each. I recommend reading along side Oliver Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat-- another nonfiction piece about the humanization of patients. Meredith O'Donnell"
276,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is fascinating and heartbreaking in equal measure. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Before she died, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in cultures for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory. Those cells, known as HeLa, are still alive today and have advanced medicine and science in countless ways; it seems there's no end to the list of discoveries made because of HeLa.I've tried to imagine how [Henrietta would] feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. Henrietta's cells helped launch the fledgling field of virology. As the Cold War escalated, some scientists exposed Henrietta's cells to massive doses of radiation to study how nuclear bombs destroyed cells and find ways to reverse that damage. Others put them in special centrifuges that spun so fast the pressure inside was more than 100,000 times that of gravity, to see what happened to human cells under the extreme conditions of deep-sea diving or spaceflight. The author took great care to learn about Henrietta Lacks. She paints Henrietta as a woman who accepted her illness and faced her treatment with unparalleled resilience and strength. One afternoon, as Henrietta lay on the couch, she lifted her shirt to show Margaret and Sadie what the treatments had done to her. Sadie gasped: The skin from Henrietta's breasts to her pelvis was charred a deep black from the radiation. The rest of her body was its normal shade -- more the color of fawn than coal. ""Hennie,"" she whispered, ""they burn you black as tar."" Henrietta just nodded and said, ""Lord, it just feels like that blackness be spreadin all inside me."" Cancer is a foul creature, sinister and terrifying, but Henrietta's cancer was a force of evil from the nadir of Hell. It ravaged her body in unmerciful ways; it's no wonder those cells survived in a test tube where all other cells died. Suddenly [Henrietta's] body went rigid as a board. She screamed as the nurse ran to the bed, tightening the straps around Henrietta's arms and legs to keep her from thrashing onto the floor as she'd done many times before. Gladys thrust the pillow from her lap into Henrietta's mouth, to keep her from biting her tongue as she convulsed in pain. The book is extensive; all of the information is efficiently organized and comprehensive. Part of what makes this book so tantalizing are all of the near-misses, all of the moments when the author was turned down in her quest to learn the truth about Henrietta Lacks. Had she given up, as so many others did, Henrietta Lacks might have been forgotten and this riveting book would have never existed. "
277,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6942006-suzy,5,"I was completely in the thrall of author Rebecca Skloot while listening to the audio of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. This is at once a scientific story of Henrietta's cancer cells, called HeLa, which were harvested from her as she was dying from cervical cancer in 1951. These are the first human cells to become ""immortal"", perpetuating themselves even to today, and being used in many important health discoveries including polio vaccines, in vitro fertilization, aids research, cancer drugs and too many others to mention. It is also the story of Henrietta and her family, who had no idea that their mother's cells were taken or the importance of the cells to medicine. Her children learn about this from Skloot's research and this knowledge causes misunderstandings and various reactions in Henrietta's adult children from some wanting financial remuneration to others just wanting their mother to be honored and respected for her contribution to science. My heart went out to Henrietta and her family who, because they were poor and black, were treated, and lived, as second class citizens. They are often at the mercy of their many health problems through lack of education, lack of access to health insurance and suspicions about the medical establishment. It seems so unjust! (Thanks to GR friend Will Byrnes for posting this NY Times article on the consent agreement reached with the family finally . . . 62 years later. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/sci...)At first I found the structure of the book a little frustrating because it jumped in both time and storyline, but once I decided to just flow with it, I was completely engaged. I think listening helped. It was as if the author was telling her story just to me, and that I was discovering it side-by-side with her. There are so many layers, that my thought is there's something to connect to for everyone based on a reader's interests coming to the book. Skloot reveals early in the book that she learned about HeLa in a biology class when she was younger and decided then and there to research and write about them. Little did she know that she would be telling the story of the Lacks family right along with the scientific importance of the cells. I appreciated the interview at the end of the audio where Skloot tells us how she decided on the focus and the structure of the book. This was the February book club pick at our wonderful art museum here in Minneapolis, and I enjoyed the discussion. I'm eagerly anticipating the HBO movie based on the book which will be aired April 22 here in the States. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5686132/"

Because of Henrietta, we know how massive doses of radiation affect the human body, and also what cells do in a zero gravity environment. The list of her contributions to science go on and on.Henrietta’s cells were taken without her permission or knowledge in early 1951. More than twenty years would pass before her family ever found out. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is Henrietta’s story, the story of her cell’s contribution to science, and the story of her family. I learned a lot from this book about Henrietta, science, and past and present patient rights in the United States. Some of the information found on these pages are truly alarming.

282,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20015365-may,4,"As a medical student, I was, and still am ashamed, that I knew next-to-nothing about Henrietta Lacks and the HUGE contribution her cells have made to science. The fact that her family can't even get reliable health insurance really just adds insult to injury. This is a well-researched, well-written book. The issue it discusses is extremely important, and the last chapter about tissue ownership is outright terrifying. It was the first time I heard of ""gene patents"" (what?), and this:Myriad Genetics, which holds the patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes responsible for most cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, charges $3,000 to test for the genes. Myriad has been accused of creating a monopoly, since no one else can offer the test, and researchers can’t develop cheaper tests or new therapies without getting permission from Myriad and paying steep licensing fees. Scientists who’ve gone ahead with research involving the breast-cancer genes without Myriad’s permission have found themselves on the receiving end of cease-and-desist letters and threats of litigation.I don't know what to say. I think this paragraph sums it up very well:
The debate over the commercialization of human biological materials always comes back to one fundamental point: like it or not, we live in a market-driven society, and science is part of that market. Baruch Blumberg, the Nobel Prize-winning researcher who used Ted Slavin’s antibodies for hepatitis B research, told me, “Whether you think the commercialization of medical research is good or bad depends on how into capitalism you are.” On the whole, Blumberg said, commercialization is good; how else would we get the drugs and diagnostic tests we need? Still, he sees a downside. “I think it’s fair to say it’s interfered with science,” he said. “It’s changed the spirit.” Now there are patents and proprietary information where there once was free information flow. “Researchers have become entrepreneurs. That’s boomed our economy and created incentives to do research. But it’s also brought problems, like secrecy and arguments over who owns what.”

283,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,5,"This is a phenomenal book. If it doesn't win every non-fiction award for 2010 than whoever votes for non-fiction awards should have their library cards taken away from them*.The author, Rebecca Skloot, does a masterful job of seamlessly weaving in the scientific story of Henrietta Lacks' immortal cells and the effect they have had on medicine and medical ethics with a real human interest story about Henrietta and the struggles of her family. Skloot does this without coming across as maudlin, preachy, overly technical, guilt ridden, condescending, or just plain boring. She deftly weaves two legs of one story together, darting in and out with ease and keeping the reader interested in learning the science and caring about the people. She does this all while doing her best to avoid passing judgment or creating villains. Like a good journalist, she simply reports the facts of a fantastically and seemingly thoroughly researched book and lets the reader interpret them as they will.In all, this is not only a terrific science book that is not afraid to tackle gray areas of ethics and leave them unanswered without getting preachy, not only a gripping human interest story with more than one human we are interested in, but also a socioeconomic look at the educational opportunities and struggles of poor, disadvantaged people across several generations of our country. Most of all though, this is a uniquely American story.*Seeing as how Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World by Liaquat Ahamed won the last Pulitzer for history, perhaps voters should have already had their library cards taken from them because that book was so bad I wouldn't even use it as a doorstop and besmirch the dignity of my door."

285,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,4,"Henrietta Lacks develops cervical cancer is the 1950's, goes into Johns Hopkins Hospital and after a couple of horrific treatments passes away. Her cells are another story, they continued to live on after biopsies of her cancerous tissue was taken without her permission or her family's knowledge and grown in labs to be shipped around the world to test diseases, develop gene therapy, and ultimately change the world. All the while, her children and family had no idea that this was happening, and they struggle to come to terms with what it means to have immortal cells, while the family can barely afford medical treatment.Rebecca Skloot takes a nearly impossible task of researching something that was breaking at the time, and challenges human rights to our own tissue and most importantly how client consent has changed over the past couple of decades. Fascinating story merging the lines of racial and gender discrimination, while also facing class struggles. In my opinion, this book should be required reading."
286,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9554958-sara,1,"The story behind the infamous ""HeLa"" cells are interesting to most scientists, as most of us have either worked with them, read endless research articles/journals utilizing them, and know about their contributions to science and/or medicine, among many more things. This immortal cell line was derived from Mrs. Lacks' cervical tissue, which became cancerous after she was infected with HPV. She recieved treatment for cervical canver at Johns Hopkins University, known at this time period for treating black patients. Though I don't know how her race/ethnicity/social status affected her personal treatment at the hospital, the actual medical treatment for her condition was unbiased and the normal protocol for any one with the condition. During this time period, research physicians, or physicians who were interetsed in biomedical research were striving to culture an immortal cell line, which has enormous applications and implications in biomedical research. The physicians, with the help of other scientists and technicians, were able to create a cell line that had greatly sought-after conditions for the purposes of biomedical research, inlcuding immortalization and ease of growth in culture. The use of her cells greatly impacted the field of biomedical research, and the cultivation and use of the HeLA cell line contributed to the establishment of the first Polio vaccine, cancer research, and countless other types of research where the characteristics of the HeLa cell line offer great advatange and resource for pusuit of scientific knowledge. My review of this book has nothing to do with the contributions her cells have made to the scientific community. The physicians at the time did take her cells and culture them without her consent, but that was standard protocol at the time, and she was not isolated for that purpose. We have all contributed from the use of her cells, therefore, it is hypocritical to be critical of the use of them.Despite a major attempt to create a ""boogey-man"" portrait of the physicians/scientists that worked with her cells, none of them were awarded financially for establishing the HeLa cell line. The author tries to create an image of a poor black woman who was robbed of her cells without consent and not awarded the enormous monentary prize for their use, but the truth is, this was standard procedure at that time period,and her cells just happened to actually work for that purpose. I was very interested to learn more about Mrs. Lacks in this book. What made this book impossible to read was the author. She hardly writes more than a few pages about Mrs. Lacks. She mostly wrote a biography detailing her attempts at finding information, without providing anything insightful about the actual woman it was supposed to be about, Mrs. Lacks. Most of the book is about her relatives and their immense anger and resentment about not being compensated for the use of Mrs. Lacks' cells. I don't really give a shit about that. A lot of shitty things happen to people in this world, this wasn't in any way the worst, and that would have made a decent book if that was what the book was supposed to be about. This book was so boring, I didn't even finish it. "
287,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"This book has been around for a while now, so most people know the basis. Rebecca Skloot tells the story here of Henrietta Lacks, the poor black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1951. Why do we care about Henrietta Lacks? Quite simply, her cells, which were taken without her knowledge or consent, became known as HeLa cells. Now does it sound familiar? HeLa cells have been around for a while, recognizable to many for their importance in developing the polio vaccine and gene mapping. HeLa cells have survived and grown since 1951.But Skloot recognized there was more to the science than just the letters HeLa. She set out to uncover the truth about the person behind the abbreviation. With the help of members of Lacks's family, Skloot spent about a decade on this book. She visited the now-defunct Clover, where Lacks grew up, she took Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, to the hospital where her sister, Elsie, was put away as an ""imbecile"" and where she died under suspicious circumstances. Deborah, who was four when Henrietta died, was just as committed to finding out the full story about her family as Skloot was.The book bounces around in time, from the 40s and 50s as Skloot detailed Henrietta's life and illness, to ""present day"" of 2009 when the book was published. Skloot's own journey with her research began in the late 90s. She got married and divorced during the writing of this book. She knew Henrietta Lacks was unknown by the public, even though her cells had been such a vital part of medicine and science for decades.The heartbreaking part about this real-life story is that Henrietta's descendants and family knew nothing about the HeLa cells themselves. They were never given any real explanation about the cells, nor were they compensated in any way. The book brings to light a lot of issues, from social to ethical. Most impressive is the concept that all tissue in and on your body belongs to you while it's attached to you, but as soon as it's removed from you, it's not longer ""yours"". You have no rights over it. It can be researched and sold and re-sold and modified and studies. You get no say in whether you want studies on pieces of your body to go towards the cure for cancer or for the creation of atomic bombs or other devices of mass destruction.Years ago I had a cyst removed. Thinking of a Margaret Atwood story, I asked my surgeon (and every subsequent tech and anesthesiologist whom I met prior to surgery) if I could keep my cyst once they excised it. After their initial responses of ""Ew, WHY?"" they told me that would not, could not, should not ever be available to me. ""But it's MINE"" I tried to argue. They claimed liability, and disease (not that I had a disease, but it's jut not sanitary). None of them had read the Atwood story I was referencing, but if they had, they would have been even more adamant that I should be allowed nowhere near the cyst once it had been removed.I've thought about the same thing during a breast biopsy and then more recently, when they removed my thyroid. What are they going to do with it? What I really would like, more than being able to keep these things that have been pulled from my body over the years, is frequent updates about the road my tissues have traveled. Remember in the 90s the popularity of things like adopting a star, or a whale, or a polar bear. You'd get a picture in the mail for the low-cost of whatever, and then a few updates throughout the year about where your whale is and how it is faring.That's what I want with the tissues that have been taken from me. Just a postcard with a picture of what they're doing with my tissues, a little update that says ""ElPa cell was just sold to Norway for the price of 8 million where they will study the effects of cigarette smoking on this tissue taken from your breast in the early 2000s!""As Skloot spent more time with the Lacks family, she became almost a member of the family herself. After the initial periods of suspicion and caution, Skloot was embraced and was called for all the important family births and deaths and other major life experiences. From a personal storytelling point of view, I found that touching, though it wasn't exactly a necessary part of the main story.I suppose really it means that HeLa (Henrietta Lacks) is a part of everyone, brings us all together. She continues to live, and while her family will never see any portion of the proceeds and still have no say over their mother's cells, there's some satisfaction that can be derived from how common the name Henrietta Lacks is now. The woman behind the cells should never be forgotten. Her contributions (that she didn't even know she was making) should be told. She was more than just the abbreviations HeLa.I know everyone has read this book already by this point, but it came up in my little world because I'm now on the Common Reader Committee at the university where I work. At the first meeting, it became obvious that very few of us are actually readers (one went so far as to say he doesn't like to read, which begs the question as to why he was even there). This book was one of my recommendations, even though I hadn't read it yet. My boss read the first six chapters and felt that it would cover a lot of the bases that our university likes to cover, and would appeal to the three main colleges very well by dealing with social justice issues, science and medicine, legality, ethics, and health and wellness.Now that I've read this book on my own I can go back to our meeting next week and say, holy shit guys, this book really does cover ALL the bases. The idea is this would be a book that everyone could read - every student, staff, and faculty member. While the story meanders a bit and gets a bit dry in other places, I think ultimately the story of Henrietta Lacks and her cells will appeal to all readers in the university.But if I hear one more time from anyone ""But are they mature enough for it"" I will scream. College students aren't quite as dumb as everyone likes to think they are. Maybe they're lazy, but cheese and rice, I'm not going to dumb down the Common Reader in concerns that students won't be able to read a book anymore.Plus there's an HBO movie coming out next month based on this book, so if just reading a book isn't incentive enough, maybe Oprah will be.(My other top contenders would be The Handmaid's Tale and March: Book One. Though some on the committee thinks if we give a graphic novel to college students they will think we're giving them ""cartoons"" to read and there may be an uprising. It's fascinating to me how little faculty and staff know the students at their own university. To be fair, those who suggest an uprising are also the ones who don't read, and they claim not to know how to read a graphic novel. Someone asked ""Do you start at the front or the back?"" conflating graphic novels with manga, I believe. This committee will be a long road for me. Someone just put me in charge already.)"

It chronicles the life of the woman whose cancerous tissue became the first tissue in history which could be successfully grown as culture and used in various, and countless, experiments from vaccine research to cloning. Her tissue was so successful in fact that it became virtually immortal, surviving in various environments and proliferating at prodigious rates. Yet, very little was known about the woman herself, her life, her family, her history, and this is what Skloot set out to uncover. What she found out is absolutely stunning from the point of medical ethics, American history and American healthcare. Fascinating. Highly recommended."

I knew a little bit about Henrietta Lacks, but I was definitely not aware of the extent to which her family was affected by the use of her sells in modern day biology. It broke my heart to see how her family, deeply rooted in religious beliefs, was broken because they felt as though Henrietta's soul resided in those cells. I have my own personal opinions about the entire concept of doctors taking medical waste for their own advantages. Nevertheless, what I can say about this issue is that it is stories such as the Tuskegee Experiment and the use of Henrietta's cells that have ultimately made the black community hesitant about wanting to go to doctors. I plan to do more research on this topic and it may be a project that I throw myself into. Hopefully I can find more text that really delves into the black community's experience with the medical field. This really opened my eyes to a lot of issues related to the medical field/industry and I can't wait to read more. "

I like a book that makes me think, just as I did when I was a college student. There's a fine line between what is ethically/morally ""right"" and that which infringes on a person's own being and that person's (or family of said person) rights to his/her cells. There are never any correct answers or final conclusions in the world of bioethics...it's an ongoing dispute but one that really caused me to question my own decisions and how they are interpreted."
292,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is required reading for pharmaceutical students at a nearby Oklahoma University where a friend of my daughter goes to college. She told me about this book over Christmas. I can see why it’s required reading. I’m glad it is and I hope it is for medical and research students everywhere.It tells the story of an African American woman, Henrietta Lacks, who went to Johns Hopkins in 1951 for treatment for cervical cancer. Some cancerous cells were removed from her body. This much she knew. The cells were also saved, cultured, and reproduced—without her knowledge or consent—as was common practice at the time. What makes this an amazing story is that Henrietta’s cells have never died from that day until the present, hence the title. They continue to grow and reproduce at a phenomenal rate. They currently exist in laboratories, hospitals and warehouses all over the world; have been used in almost every form of scientific research from the 50’s until now; have gone to space; have been contaminated and caused contamination. The scientific and medical communities owe untold debt to the cells it calls HeLa and yet not one dime of compensation, even in terms of discounted medical care or health insurance has ever been received by any of Henrietta’s numerous descendants. Interestingly enough, they aren’t looking for anything in that way. Now isn’t that refreshing? Rather, in spite of all they have suffered—and indeed this is a book about pain—their focal interest throughout was in finding out what happened to their mother since she died so young, gaining recognition for her and learning what happened to Henrietta’s oldest daughter who died in a ‘hospital for the negro insane’, which was 1950’s terminology.  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks crosses many disciplines and for that reason I expect scientists might skim the vignettes about Henrietta’s children, while those who prefer human interest could find themselves avoiding the technical sections. Virginia Woolf’s Common Readers, however, will positively adore this book! It has everything they look for in the written word. Not only what was just mentioned, but also: the complexities and importance of the ‘tissue issue’, what are the medical, legal, ethical, and other parameters for tissue gathering, storage, research, usage, and compensation. And I commend the author, Rebecca Skloot, a self-proclaimed non-believer for her sensitive handling of the many stressed and stressful events, issues and personalities she encountered concerning matters of faith, morals, and religion.  A very important book to read!  Here is a rather long but fascinating 1998 BBC documentary about Henrietta Lacks and HeLa.  Here is an article which gives some more current info about the Lacks family and the issue of privacy v. tissue donation. "
293,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"Henrietta Lacks, a young African-American mother of five children, died in Baltimore in 1951 from a highly aggressive form of cervical cancer—but more than fifty years after her death, part of her lives on in the form of HeLa, a cell line cultivated from a tissue sample of hers which played a key role in several major scientific and medical breakthroughs. Skloot's book tells Lacks' story, partly to pay tribute to a woman who was forgotten by all but her family for many years despite her importance to medicine; partly in order to examine the complex attendant issues of medical ethics, race and class. Skloot's writing is fluid and accessible, and I learned some things which were shocking though not surprising to me (see the organ retention scandal which broke in Ireland a few years ago). That said, I would have liked for a stronger focus on the ethics and the science aspect of the novel and less on the lives of Lacks' children and other relatives. Skloot's focus on them and on some of the more unpalatable aspects of their lives felt quite voyeuristic to me at points, recounted not because Skloot wanted to examine the effects of the vicious cycle of poverty on people's lives but because it would inject more drama into the book. The author talks at length about the less-than-pure motivations of those who had previously profited from Lacks' cells, and their refusal to compensate Lacks' family in any way, about how she was financing her research with credit cards and student loans—and yet her end-goal was always to acquire a book deal, and her account of her relentless attempts to get in touch with members of the Lacks family made me highly uncomfortable. Much of the latter half of the book dealt with the relationship between Skloot and Deborah, Henrietta Lacks' youngest daughter—again, uncomfortable to read about at several points, and not especially relevant to the book's main thrust. Overall, an interesting read, but I feel that The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks could easily have been edited down to half its length—and focused more on Henrietta because of it."

The weft is the story of a friendship between two women meeting each other on the edge of both their worlds, brought there by Henrietta: her immortality is not simply a series of cells.the narrators are excellent. the pacing is a tiny bit slow, but that works for the direct quotes - and hearing voices in dialect anchors the story in time and place. The voices in this story - the amount of quoted text & speech- keep this story very immediate - with the feel of a good documentary or good fiction.a joy."

I tell you the premise, and that's the book. It just keeps doubling over itself to tell you the same science, the same sad story of the people it affected, and nothing ever really happens. People say things like ""hold on, are you ready for this?"" and then nothing happens. It's the same information over and over. So I'm going to spoil the whole book for you; Henrietta Lacks was a poor syphilitic black woman who married her cousin, had a bunch of kids, and died very young of an aggressive cancer, the cells of which doctors took samples of without asking and then developed into the first 'immortal' cell line, which went on to be used by scientist and doctors around the world. Her descendants are plagued by poverty and bad health. That's it. Now imagine me telling you different versions of that over and over while I also tell you about how I'm researching and writing about it, dealing with this difficult and suspicious relatives. That's the book. "

Henrietta Lacks was a poor black women who cells were taken without her consent and used by many scientists to develop vaccines,cloning, and many more things. Unfortunately her family was very poor and never received any money from her cells being used.They had many health problems and could not afford health insurance and died young as a result. I learned a lot of interesting facts while reading this book. "

298,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"Its a very important story, its unique in its format of that the cells of Henrietta lacks are doing and how it seems that even today nobody understand why or how those cells are even still alive, BUT sadly the actual story of doctors doing something without permission is NOT a unique one, since sadly there are still today patients being used without their knowledge -as it is even stated in the book itself. And i think that especially that is something that should be taking away from this book: This story is important and interesting, but so far not much has changed in the medical field so that this type of thing does not continues to happen without permission from the patients themselves. This book does point out quiet a lot of positive things that happened because and with cells and how it could have never happened without them. Some horrendous things, some wonderful things where achieved thanks to those cells and with that thanks to Henrietta Lacks. And i am defiantly one of the first people to point out that medical advances are necessary and that we still have way to little knowledge and actual solutions for way to man illnesses! But i think that this book also points out two very important things and drives them home quiet nicely: 1. Human tissue was once part of a person!We all should respect that. Yes its important that a lot of different science fields have access to tissue samples. But its also important to remember the people that gave those samples. Be it willingly, unwillingly, during life or after their death, it was once part of a living breathing person! I think a lot of us prefer to ignore that, or try to forget it and i think that is defiantly one thing we all should work on always remembering when we take any kind of medicine without a second thought! 2. there are lot of loopholes legally that should be worked on!All this talk of ""technically it wasn't required"" in this book just made me want to shake someone! What it comes down to in very basic forms -especially in regards of this specific book and the story it tells- is that everyone should be asking for permission. Doctors and scientists should explain in understandable terms what they want and why it could be helpful and i am pretty sure that a lot of people -especially those with illnesses!- will be more than willing to hand out tissue samples for further use! No need to just take them without asking! So why do it?Which brings it all back to the first point: lets not forget all those ""samples"" actually come from someone that is not just there to be a lab-rat!Now the one ""negative"" thing of this book is that i personally didn't really like how the Skloot wrote this book. Some sections felt as if she wanted to get that particular part of the story told and done with as fast as possible and shoved a lot of details and information into a pretty small section and number of pages. And than sometimes she would go on and on about some things for endless number of pages that i personally felt that it wasn't necessary to go on about it for that long. To say it short it is not he best nonfiction writing i have read. BUT its also far from the worst. Its very readable and yes it could have been kept a little shorter, but all in all it was done pretty well in the writing department. of course that is completely personal and some of the reviews i read LOVED the writing, so clearly that part is debatable.If you are interested in this book, defiantly give it a try. If you are going into a scientific field? Defiantly read this!"
299,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,"A book like this makes me realize how important education in general and particularly science education is. Today’s science is yesterday’s magic—for those who don’t understand science, it can seem like very frightening black magic. The story of Henrietta Lacks explores the intersection between science, research, education, capitalism, civil rights, and consent.The major question implicit in this book is whether we have any claim to our own cells after they have been removed from our bodies. Is it ethical to take “discarded” cells—those left over after medical procedures—and do research from them and potentially make money from either the cells or the research. This issue gets us down somewhere in our irrational subconscious—after all, we all “know” enough about voodoo and black magic to know that curses require hair, nail clippings, blood, or other bodily secretions in order to be effective. In many ways, the story of the HeLa cell line traces the history of medical research in the US (and to some extent, other countries), evolving from the exploitation of vulnerable people towards the concept of informed consent. It also traces the history of an African American family, liberated from slavery, but not from poverty and deprivation. The current distrust of science has some real roots in situations like these, where people were used without their knowledge for experimental purposes. But the lack of scientific literacy in the general population helps with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and the prevalence of medical quackery. Witness all the “miracle cures” that people buy into. One older lady that I used to work with was always pouring money into some miracle weight loss scheme or another—it didn’t seem to occur to her that if the method actually worked, it would be front page news on Time magazine, not some obscure ad in the back of a newspaper.We have to seriously question ourselves and our politicians about the quality of our educational systems. Are they being funded? Do we have enough teachers? Can poor children hope to get education equal to that of rich children?As my grandfather used to say, no education is wasted."
300,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,5,"Henrietta Lacks is a woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951. The cells cut from her body, because of their aptitude for growth and replication, still play a significant role in treating disease and other medical tests. She did not know her cells were being used, and her family did not benefit financially. The author writes extensively about her family, as they were a crucial source for the book. Because of so many trust relationships violated over the years, she had to first work to build trust and prove herself reliable. She went on to establish a trust for the family.This book discusses science, both the present state of medicine while Henrietta was being treated for cervical cancer (nothing short of radium tube inserts and lead!) and how science has grown in its understandings and treatments because of her cells. The book has to address the ways African Americans have been treated badly by the American medical establishment from Tuskagee to forced sterilizations, to even some patients injected with Henrietta's cells without their knowledge! I felt like I knew much of the story already, but only because this book has received so much acclaim and press, and I find rightly so. I'm not a scientist but felt I could understand it as Skloot presented the information.I also learned some terrifying things that don't soothe my paranoia. Huge government stores of cells that no longer belong to you - not owning the rights to your bodily tissue - still all true in the 21st century. Ever wonder where your blood, teeth, etc. got to? Ha. I read this during Banned Books Week 2015 because earlier this year it was challenged by a Tennessee mother who felt it was ""pornographic."" The woman had cervical cancer, cancer of the CERVIX, a body part all women have. Oh please. This book isn't pornography, it's science. Discussed on Episode 042 of the Reading Envy Podcast."
301,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186579-kate,1,"This book irritated me from the beginning. It couldn't decide if it was a history of the cells, the life story of one woman, a chronicle of how an author tracks down the life story of a woman, a position paper on racism, a position paper on human tissue ownership, or a position paper on disorganized rhetoric. I think it was all of those, and it drove me absolutely up the wall.As a history of the HeLa cells ... I read a Wired article that was better.As the life story of Henrietta Lacks ... it read like a list of facts instead of a human interest piece. And it kept going on tangents (with the life stories of each of her children, her doctors, etc.)As the story of the author tracking down a story ... that was actually kind of interesting.As a position paper on racism...it had a lot of disturbing stories - but no cohesive point.As a position paper on human tissue ownership... the best chapter was the last one, which actually listed facts and laws. And while the author clearly had an opinion in that chapter -it was more focused and less full of unrelated stories intended to pull on your hearts strings and shift your opinion.As a position paper on disorganized rhetoric...it was a stellar exemplar."
302,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"I don't know how many copies of a book need to be sold before it can be fairly described as a best-seller. In any case what kind of bearing does the number of copies sold have on the amount that a book is read? The success of Rebecca Skloot's book is maybe entirely unsurprising as it covers a wide range of angles and caters for many tastes. It has something of the ever popular misery mémoire, some social history, an investigative aspect with detective road trips, along with an exploration of one of the wonders of modern science. All of this comes together in two alternating narrative strands, the death of Henrietta Lacks from cancer and the strange ongoing life and use of a tissue sample collected from her that has been used for a host of purposes from cancer research to gene mapping to assessing human sensitivity to commercial products, as well as the impact of her life and death on her young family. As a whole it was a moving reading experience.The story told is a very simple one, and I found how it is told completely effective. It is not surprising that some forms of cancer, even with treatment, are fatal. It is not surprising that poor black people in the USA remain poor over time, it is not surprising that difficult childhood experiences can overshadow later adult lives, it is even not surprising that something if not entirely free to obtain like the tissue sample in question, has come to be a source of profit for many companies while providing no benefit to either the donor’s family nor the institution which provided Henrietta Lacks with medical treatment and collected the sample in the first place. Perhaps part of the success of Skloot's narration is just how unsurprising those elements of the story are juxtaposed with the completely unexpected survival and continuing life of Henrietta Lacks' tissue sample. There is a recognisable slice of life married with something unique so far in science and of enduring scientific impact.For me the most serious downside is that I had the feeling that Skloot had hoped her book might start a public debate on issues of sample ownership, but so far that discussion so far has not escaped the courts. That leaves us with a great piece of non-fiction writing rather than a rallying cry for change."
303,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,5,"In reading non-fiction, and particularly scientific non-fiction, my two most frequent gripes are: a lack of personal story, and a lack of overall narrative. It's my opinion that just because a work isn't fiction, it shouldn't miss out on the use of structural elements more common to fiction: a strong narrative and narrative structure can improve any kind of communication.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a near-flawless implementation of this. The book has three components: the story of Henrietta and her family, the story of the science made possible by Henrietta, and the story of the author, Skloot, researching the book. I can't stress enough how effectively these three threads are woven together, making a educational, intersectional, and ultimately tragic story. If you are interested in the human side of scientific advance then this is an absolute, absolute must-read. Highly recommended."

As always, I enjoyed the close-up views of racial issues.I'm glad that the author wrote this book, as I'm sure it helped Henrietta's family understand what really took place all those years ago.

305,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5036644-meredith-o-donnell,2,"Interesting concept. Reading it with my book club... Upate: Finished. I am always up for a rousing ethical debate. The deplorable breach of privacy, a basic human right, displayed in the book was appalling. Anyone who has ever been dehumanized can relate to the way Henrietta was objectified for the sake of science. It was beyond unconscionable. I am glad the story was told. I hope that Skloot's efforts will remind the industry of science and medicine that they need to be held accountable for their actions, and the finished product is not the only thing that matters, but the methods taken on their road to discovery count as well. Henrietta's cells have provided mankind with a lot to be grateful for, and for that we must thank the scientists and doctors who worked feverishly and masterfully, experimenting and coming up with new ideas. However, the people behind the cells have rights too. Bioethics have come a long way since the 1950's, but there are still flaws.  I learned in several journalism courses I took in college that the job of the journalist is to hold accountable those who serve the public--be it in politics, consumerism, or medicine. That is what Skloot has done by tackling the story of Henrietta Lacks--the person behind the immortal HeLa cell line. For that, I commend her. While I agreed with the endeavor, I had a few issues with her strategy. As others have mentioned, she placed herself in the story excessively. She claimed it was necessary, but I doubt if it was necessary to the extent that she did it. She seemed to want to constantly remind the reader of her plight. This is not the place of a journalist--just tell the story, don't tell your own story of getting the story. Also, she had an incredibly obvious bias, and a suspiciously not-so-obvious agenda. I did question Skloot's intentions. She spoke as an advocate for the Lacks family, but I do wonder whether or not she was a welcomed one, or a useful one.  She classifies the book as nonfiction upfront. And that it is. Or was intended to be... the story is real. But the details were so convoluted, shrouded and murky that it became difficult to truly believe with any authority one thing or the other. For instance, Skloot admits that the medical field was not proficient in recording things during this time (no computer.) Consequently, a lot of important details concerning Henrietta's illness, diagnosis, the retrieval of her cells, her death, her autopsy, her burial, among other factors, were not clearly documented. Also, Skloot's main sources of information were the Lacks family--a family frought with incest, disease, mental illness, partial deafness, drug abuse, a lack of intelligence and a lack of education--none of which was their fault, but all of which made them unreliable sources of information. For instance-- did Henrietta ever meet Gey? His assistant Mary swears yes. But Dave Lacks says absolutely not. The tie breaker is dead..and was on her death bed/twisted with pain/heavily medicated during the time of the alleged meeting so it is not out of the realm of possibilities that she either forgot about the encounter or didn't think to bring it up. It's also just as possible that Mary was confused (no documentation,) or was lying. I have no reason to believe one over the other. Also, Joe's murder. Skloot decided to present the family's convenient recollection of events authoritatively--that it was self defense. However, a witness testified under oath that the fatal attack was unprovoked. Again, I have no incentive to take one side over the other, but Skloot's selective storytelling contributed to my distrust of her as a narrator, a writer and a reporter.  When I read a nonfiction piece, I prefer for the facts to be indisputable. Aside from credibility issues, I also questioned Skloot's true motives. She hid behind an ultra-liberal facade: a sympathetic crusader who was empowering this poor, uneducated family with the voice they never had. But notice how she proudly boasts of a deep friendship with Deborah Lacks in the beginning of the book... but I wonder if Deborah, God rest her soul, would confirm this claim. We'll never know. Skloot seemed to pester the family, while at the same time condemning those who did the same...as if her reasons were more pure and justifiable. She also clearly lamented their lack of medical coverage and financial compensation, and a portion of the proceeds for the book will go to a scholarship fund for the family, but why didn't she just write them a big check? They didn't benefit directly. If you read closely, Skloot reveals that she had to agree to certain conditions before the Lacks family would agree to talk to her. She had to tell the family's story exactly the way it was told to her, whether facts were verified or not. She was so desperate to satisfy, what started out as her own morbid curiosity, and grew into an obsessive mission, that she agreed to this stipulation. That almost concealed little tidbit, combined with the unreliability and untrustworthiness of the medical profession during that time, left this reader skeptical of nearly every word. However, the subject matter and her insistance to reinstate the human side to a research subject, as well as the fact that Skloot manages to make very technical terminology and notions perfectly clear to a former B student in Biology, earn the writer one star each. I recommend reading along side Oliver Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat-- another nonfiction piece about the humanization of patients. Meredith O'Donnell"
306,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is fascinating and heartbreaking in equal measure. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Before she died, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in cultures for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory. Those cells, known as HeLa, are still alive today and have advanced medicine and science in countless ways; it seems there's no end to the list of discoveries made because of HeLa.I've tried to imagine how [Henrietta would] feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. Henrietta's cells helped launch the fledgling field of virology. As the Cold War escalated, some scientists exposed Henrietta's cells to massive doses of radiation to study how nuclear bombs destroyed cells and find ways to reverse that damage. Others put them in special centrifuges that spun so fast the pressure inside was more than 100,000 times that of gravity, to see what happened to human cells under the extreme conditions of deep-sea diving or spaceflight. The author took great care to learn about Henrietta Lacks. She paints Henrietta as a woman who accepted her illness and faced her treatment with unparalleled resilience and strength. One afternoon, as Henrietta lay on the couch, she lifted her shirt to show Margaret and Sadie what the treatments had done to her. Sadie gasped: The skin from Henrietta's breasts to her pelvis was charred a deep black from the radiation. The rest of her body was its normal shade -- more the color of fawn than coal. ""Hennie,"" she whispered, ""they burn you black as tar."" Henrietta just nodded and said, ""Lord, it just feels like that blackness be spreadin all inside me."" Cancer is a foul creature, sinister and terrifying, but Henrietta's cancer was a force of evil from the nadir of Hell. It ravaged her body in unmerciful ways; it's no wonder those cells survived in a test tube where all other cells died. Suddenly [Henrietta's] body went rigid as a board. She screamed as the nurse ran to the bed, tightening the straps around Henrietta's arms and legs to keep her from thrashing onto the floor as she'd done many times before. Gladys thrust the pillow from her lap into Henrietta's mouth, to keep her from biting her tongue as she convulsed in pain. The book is extensive; all of the information is efficiently organized and comprehensive. Part of what makes this book so tantalizing are all of the near-misses, all of the moments when the author was turned down in her quest to learn the truth about Henrietta Lacks. Had she given up, as so many others did, Henrietta Lacks might have been forgotten and this riveting book would have never existed. "
307,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6942006-suzy,5,"I was completely in the thrall of author Rebecca Skloot while listening to the audio of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. This is at once a scientific story of Henrietta's cancer cells, called HeLa, which were harvested from her as she was dying from cervical cancer in 1951. These are the first human cells to become ""immortal"", perpetuating themselves even to today, and being used in many important health discoveries including polio vaccines, in vitro fertilization, aids research, cancer drugs and too many others to mention. It is also the story of Henrietta and her family, who had no idea that their mother's cells were taken or the importance of the cells to medicine. Her children learn about this from Skloot's research and this knowledge causes misunderstandings and various reactions in Henrietta's adult children from some wanting financial remuneration to others just wanting their mother to be honored and respected for her contribution to science. My heart went out to Henrietta and her family who, because they were poor and black, were treated, and lived, as second class citizens. They are often at the mercy of their many health problems through lack of education, lack of access to health insurance and suspicions about the medical establishment. It seems so unjust! (Thanks to GR friend Will Byrnes for posting this NY Times article on the consent agreement reached with the family finally . . . 62 years later. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/sci...)At first I found the structure of the book a little frustrating because it jumped in both time and storyline, but once I decided to just flow with it, I was completely engaged. I think listening helped. It was as if the author was telling her story just to me, and that I was discovering it side-by-side with her. There are so many layers, that my thought is there's something to connect to for everyone based on a reader's interests coming to the book. Skloot reveals early in the book that she learned about HeLa in a biology class when she was younger and decided then and there to research and write about them. Little did she know that she would be telling the story of the Lacks family right along with the scientific importance of the cells. I appreciated the interview at the end of the audio where Skloot tells us how she decided on the focus and the structure of the book. This was the February book club pick at our wonderful art museum here in Minneapolis, and I enjoyed the discussion. I'm eagerly anticipating the HBO movie based on the book which will be aired April 22 here in the States. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5686132/"

The list of her contributions to science go on and on.Henrietta’s cells were taken without her permission or knowledge in early 1951. More than twenty years would pass before her family ever found out. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is Henrietta’s story, the story of her cell’s contribution to science, and the story of her family. I learned a lot from this book about Henrietta, science, and past and present patient rights in the United States. Some of the information found on these pages are truly alarming. Rebecca Skloot did a thorough and diligent job with her research, and her writing is exceptional. I’m grateful to Rebecca for telling Henrietta’s story!"

I'm grateful to have learned the story of Henrietta Lacks, but the book just wasn't riveting for me. It was fascinating, in many ways, but I felt like it could have been half as long and just as effective. I liked it, but I more admired it than wanted to read it again."

312,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20015365-may,4,"As a medical student, I was, and still am ashamed, that I knew next-to-nothing about Henrietta Lacks and the HUGE contribution her cells have made to science. The fact that her family can't even get reliable health insurance really just adds insult to injury. This is a well-researched, well-written book. The issue it discusses is extremely important, and the last chapter about tissue ownership is outright terrifying. It was the first time I heard of ""gene patents"" (what?), and this:Myriad Genetics, which holds the patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes responsible for most cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, charges $3,000 to test for the genes. Myriad has been accused of creating a monopoly, since no one else can offer the test, and researchers can’t develop cheaper tests or new therapies without getting permission from Myriad and paying steep licensing fees. Scientists who’ve gone ahead with research involving the breast-cancer genes without Myriad’s permission have found themselves on the receiving end of cease-and-desist letters and threats of litigation.I don't know what to say. I think this paragraph sums it up very well:
The debate over the commercialization of human biological materials always comes back to one fundamental point: like it or not, we live in a market-driven society, and science is part of that market. Baruch Blumberg, the Nobel Prize-winning researcher who used Ted Slavin’s antibodies for hepatitis B research, told me, “Whether you think the commercialization of medical research is good or bad depends on how into capitalism you are.” On the whole, Blumberg said, commercialization is good; how else would we get the drugs and diagnostic tests we need? Still, he sees a downside. “I think it’s fair to say it’s interfered with science,” he said. “It’s changed the spirit.” Now there are patents and proprietary information where there once was free information flow. “Researchers have become entrepreneurs. That’s boomed our economy and created incentives to do research. But it’s also brought problems, like secrecy and arguments over who owns what.”

313,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,5,"This is a phenomenal book. If it doesn't win every non-fiction award for 2010 than whoever votes for non-fiction awards should have their library cards taken away from them*.The author, Rebecca Skloot, does a masterful job of seamlessly weaving in the scientific story of Henrietta Lacks' immortal cells and the effect they have had on medicine and medical ethics with a real human interest story about Henrietta and the struggles of her family. Skloot does this without coming across as maudlin, preachy, overly technical, guilt ridden, condescending, or just plain boring. She deftly weaves two legs of one story together, darting in and out with ease and keeping the reader interested in learning the science and caring about the people. She does this all while doing her best to avoid passing judgment or creating villains. Like a good journalist, she simply reports the facts of a fantastically and seemingly thoroughly researched book and lets the reader interpret them as they will.In all, this is not only a terrific science book that is not afraid to tackle gray areas of ethics and leave them unanswered without getting preachy, not only a gripping human interest story with more than one human we are interested in, but also a socioeconomic look at the educational opportunities and struggles of poor, disadvantaged people across several generations of our country. Most of all though, this is a uniquely American story.*Seeing as how Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World by Liaquat Ahamed won the last Pulitzer for history, perhaps voters should have already had their library cards taken from them because that book was so bad I wouldn't even use it as a doorstop and besmirch the dignity of my door."

Her cells are another story, they continued to live on after biopsies of her cancerous tissue was taken without her permission or her family's knowledge and grown in labs to be shipped around the world to test diseases, develop gene therapy, and ultimately change the world. All the while, her children and family had no idea that this was happening, and they struggle to come to terms with what it means to have immortal cells, while the family can barely afford medical treatment.Rebecca Skloot takes a nearly impossible task of researching something that was breaking at the time, and challenges human rights to our own tissue and most importantly how client consent has changed over the past couple of decades. Fascinating story merging the lines of racial and gender discrimination, while also facing class struggles. In my opinion, this book should be required reading."
316,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9554958-sara,1,"The story behind the infamous ""HeLa"" cells are interesting to most scientists, as most of us have either worked with them, read endless research articles/journals utilizing them, and know about their contributions to science and/or medicine, among many more things. This immortal cell line was derived from Mrs. Lacks' cervical tissue, which became cancerous after she was infected with HPV. She recieved treatment for cervical canver at Johns Hopkins University, known at this time period for treating black patients. Though I don't know how her race/ethnicity/social status affected her personal treatment at the hospital, the actual medical treatment for her condition was unbiased and the normal protocol for any one with the condition. During this time period, research physicians, or physicians who were interetsed in biomedical research were striving to culture an immortal cell line, which has enormous applications and implications in biomedical research. The physicians, with the help of other scientists and technicians, were able to create a cell line that had greatly sought-after conditions for the purposes of biomedical research, inlcuding immortalization and ease of growth in culture. The use of her cells greatly impacted the field of biomedical research, and the cultivation and use of the HeLA cell line contributed to the establishment of the first Polio vaccine, cancer research, and countless other types of research where the characteristics of the HeLa cell line offer great advatange and resource for pusuit of scientific knowledge. My review of this book has nothing to do with the contributions her cells have made to the scientific community. The physicians at the time did take her cells and culture them without her consent, but that was standard protocol at the time, and she was not isolated for that purpose. We have all contributed from the use of her cells, therefore, it is hypocritical to be critical of the use of them.Despite a major attempt to create a ""boogey-man"" portrait of the physicians/scientists that worked with her cells, none of them were awarded financially for establishing the HeLa cell line. The author tries to create an image of a poor black woman who was robbed of her cells without consent and not awarded the enormous monentary prize for their use, but the truth is, this was standard procedure at that time period,and her cells just happened to actually work for that purpose. I was very interested to learn more about Mrs. Lacks in this book. What made this book impossible to read was the author. She hardly writes more than a few pages about Mrs. Lacks. She mostly wrote a biography detailing her attempts at finding information, without providing anything insightful about the actual woman it was supposed to be about, Mrs. Lacks. Most of the book is about her relatives and their immense anger and resentment about not being compensated for the use of Mrs. Lacks' cells. I don't really give a shit about that. A lot of shitty things happen to people in this world, this wasn't in any way the worst, and that would have made a decent book if that was what the book was supposed to be about. This book was so boring, I didn't even finish it. "
317,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"This book has been around for a while now, so most people know the basis. Rebecca Skloot tells the story here of Henrietta Lacks, the poor black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1951. Why do we care about Henrietta Lacks? Quite simply, her cells, which were taken without her knowledge or consent, became known as HeLa cells. Now does it sound familiar? HeLa cells have been around for a while, recognizable to many for their importance in developing the polio vaccine and gene mapping. HeLa cells have survived and grown since 1951.But Skloot recognized there was more to the science than just the letters HeLa. She set out to uncover the truth about the person behind the abbreviation. With the help of members of Lacks's family, Skloot spent about a decade on this book. She visited the now-defunct Clover, where Lacks grew up, she took Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, to the hospital where her sister, Elsie, was put away as an ""imbecile"" and where she died under suspicious circumstances. Deborah, who was four when Henrietta died, was just as committed to finding out the full story about her family as Skloot was.The book bounces around in time, from the 40s and 50s as Skloot detailed Henrietta's life and illness, to ""present day"" of 2009 when the book was published. Skloot's own journey with her research began in the late 90s. She got married and divorced during the writing of this book. She knew Henrietta Lacks was unknown by the public, even though her cells had been such a vital part of medicine and science for decades.The heartbreaking part about this real-life story is that Henrietta's descendants and family knew nothing about the HeLa cells themselves. They were never given any real explanation about the cells, nor were they compensated in any way. The book brings to light a lot of issues, from social to ethical. Most impressive is the concept that all tissue in and on your body belongs to you while it's attached to you, but as soon as it's removed from you, it's not longer ""yours"". You have no rights over it. It can be researched and sold and re-sold and modified and studies. You get no say in whether you want studies on pieces of your body to go towards the cure for cancer or for the creation of atomic bombs or other devices of mass destruction.Years ago I had a cyst removed. Thinking of a Margaret Atwood story, I asked my surgeon (and every subsequent tech and anesthesiologist whom I met prior to surgery) if I could keep my cyst once they excised it. After their initial responses of ""Ew, WHY?"" they told me that would not, could not, should not ever be available to me. ""But it's MINE"" I tried to argue. They claimed liability, and disease (not that I had a disease, but it's jut not sanitary). None of them had read the Atwood story I was referencing, but if they had, they would have been even more adamant that I should be allowed nowhere near the cyst once it had been removed.I've thought about the same thing during a breast biopsy and then more recently, when they removed my thyroid. What are they going to do with it? What I really would like, more than being able to keep these things that have been pulled from my body over the years, is frequent updates about the road my tissues have traveled. Remember in the 90s the popularity of things like adopting a star, or a whale, or a polar bear. You'd get a picture in the mail for the low-cost of whatever, and then a few updates throughout the year about where your whale is and how it is faring.That's what I want with the tissues that have been taken from me. Just a postcard with a picture of what they're doing with my tissues, a little update that says ""ElPa cell was just sold to Norway for the price of 8 million where they will study the effects of cigarette smoking on this tissue taken from your breast in the early 2000s!""As Skloot spent more time with the Lacks family, she became almost a member of the family herself. After the initial periods of suspicion and caution, Skloot was embraced and was called for all the important family births and deaths and other major life experiences. From a personal storytelling point of view, I found that touching, though it wasn't exactly a necessary part of the main story.I suppose really it means that HeLa (Henrietta Lacks) is a part of everyone, brings us all together. She continues to live, and while her family will never see any portion of the proceeds and still have no say over their mother's cells, there's some satisfaction that can be derived from how common the name Henrietta Lacks is now. The woman behind the cells should never be forgotten. Her contributions (that she didn't even know she was making) should be told. She was more than just the abbreviations HeLa.I know everyone has read this book already by this point, but it came up in my little world because I'm now on the Common Reader Committee at the university where I work. At the first meeting, it became obvious that very few of us are actually readers (one went so far as to say he doesn't like to read, which begs the question as to why he was even there). This book was one of my recommendations, even though I hadn't read it yet. My boss read the first six chapters and felt that it would cover a lot of the bases that our university likes to cover, and would appeal to the three main colleges very well by dealing with social justice issues, science and medicine, legality, ethics, and health and wellness.Now that I've read this book on my own I can go back to our meeting next week and say, holy shit guys, this book really does cover ALL the bases. The idea is this would be a book that everyone could read - every student, staff, and faculty member. While the story meanders a bit and gets a bit dry in other places, I think ultimately the story of Henrietta Lacks and her cells will appeal to all readers in the university.But if I hear one more time from anyone ""But are they mature enough for it"" I will scream. College students aren't quite as dumb as everyone likes to think they are. Maybe they're lazy, but cheese and rice, I'm not going to dumb down the Common Reader in concerns that students won't be able to read a book anymore.Plus there's an HBO movie coming out next month based on this book, so if just reading a book isn't incentive enough, maybe Oprah will be.(My other top contenders would be The Handmaid's Tale and March: Book One. Though some on the committee thinks if we give a graphic novel to college students they will think we're giving them ""cartoons"" to read and there may be an uprising. It's fascinating to me how little faculty and staff know the students at their own university. To be fair, those who suggest an uprising are also the ones who don't read, and they claim not to know how to read a graphic novel. Someone asked ""Do you start at the front or the back?"" conflating graphic novels with manga, I believe. This committee will be a long road for me. Someone just put me in charge already.)"
318,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,5,"It reads like good crime fiction. It chronicles the life of the woman whose cancerous tissue became the first tissue in history which could be successfully grown as culture and used in various, and countless, experiments from vaccine research to cloning. Her tissue was so successful in fact that it became virtually immortal, surviving in various environments and proliferating at prodigious rates. Yet, very little was known about the woman herself, her life, her family, her history, and this is what Skloot set out to uncover. What she found out is absolutely stunning from the point of medical ethics, American history and American healthcare. Fascinating. Highly recommended."

320,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27544898-bookishrealm,5,"This book was phenomenal in more ways than one. I knew a little bit about Henrietta Lacks, but I was definitely not aware of the extent to which her family was affected by the use of her sells in modern day biology. It broke my heart to see how her family, deeply rooted in religious beliefs, was broken because they felt as though Henrietta's soul resided in those cells. I have my own personal opinions about the entire concept of doctors taking medical waste for their own advantages. Nevertheless, what I can say about this issue is that it is stories such as the Tuskegee Experiment and the use of Henrietta's cells that have ultimately made the black community hesitant about wanting to go to doctors. I plan to do more research on this topic and it may be a project that I throw myself into. Hopefully I can find more text that really delves into the black community's experience with the medical field. This really opened my eyes to a lot of issues related to the medical field/industry and I can't wait to read more. "

There's a fine line between what is ethically/morally ""right"" and that which infringes on a person's own being and that person's (or family of said person) rights to his/her cells. There are never any correct answers or final conclusions in the world of bioethics...it's an ongoing dispute but one that really caused me to question my own decisions and how they are interpreted."
322,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is required reading for pharmaceutical students at a nearby Oklahoma University where a friend of my daughter goes to college. She told me about this book over Christmas. I can see why it’s required reading. I’m glad it is and I hope it is for medical and research students everywhere.It tells the story of an African American woman, Henrietta Lacks, who went to Johns Hopkins in 1951 for treatment for cervical cancer. Some cancerous cells were removed from her body. This much she knew. The cells were also saved, cultured, and reproduced—without her knowledge or consent—as was common practice at the time. What makes this an amazing story is that Henrietta’s cells have never died from that day until the present, hence the title. They continue to grow and reproduce at a phenomenal rate. They currently exist in laboratories, hospitals and warehouses all over the world; have been used in almost every form of scientific research from the 50’s until now; have gone to space; have been contaminated and caused contamination. The scientific and medical communities owe untold debt to the cells it calls HeLa and yet not one dime of compensation, even in terms of discounted medical care or health insurance has ever been received by any of Henrietta’s numerous descendants. Interestingly enough, they aren’t looking for anything in that way. Now isn’t that refreshing? Rather, in spite of all they have suffered—and indeed this is a book about pain—their focal interest throughout was in finding out what happened to their mother since she died so young, gaining recognition for her and learning what happened to Henrietta’s oldest daughter who died in a ‘hospital for the negro insane’, which was 1950’s terminology.  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks crosses many disciplines and for that reason I expect scientists might skim the vignettes about Henrietta’s children, while those who prefer human interest could find themselves avoiding the technical sections. Virginia Woolf’s Common Readers, however, will positively adore this book! It has everything they look for in the written word. Not only what was just mentioned, but also: the complexities and importance of the ‘tissue issue’, what are the medical, legal, ethical, and other parameters for tissue gathering, storage, research, usage, and compensation. And I commend the author, Rebecca Skloot, a self-proclaimed non-believer for her sensitive handling of the many stressed and stressful events, issues and personalities she encountered concerning matters of faith, morals, and religion.  A very important book to read!  Here is a rather long but fascinating 1998 BBC documentary about Henrietta Lacks and HeLa.  Here is an article which gives some more current info about the Lacks family and the issue of privacy v. tissue donation. "
323,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"Henrietta Lacks, a young African-American mother of five children, died in Baltimore in 1951 from a highly aggressive form of cervical cancer—but more than fifty years after her death, part of her lives on in the form of HeLa, a cell line cultivated from a tissue sample of hers which played a key role in several major scientific and medical breakthroughs. Skloot's book tells Lacks' story, partly to pay tribute to a woman who was forgotten by all but her family for many years despite her importance to medicine; partly in order to examine the complex attendant issues of medical ethics, race and class. Skloot's writing is fluid and accessible, and I learned some things which were shocking though not surprising to me (see the organ retention scandal which broke in Ireland a few years ago). That said, I would have liked for a stronger focus on the ethics and the science aspect of the novel and less on the lives of Lacks' children and other relatives. Skloot's focus on them and on some of the more unpalatable aspects of their lives felt quite voyeuristic to me at points, recounted not because Skloot wanted to examine the effects of the vicious cycle of poverty on people's lives but because it would inject more drama into the book. The author talks at length about the less-than-pure motivations of those who had previously profited from Lacks' cells, and their refusal to compensate Lacks' family in any way, about how she was financing her research with credit cards and student loans—and yet her end-goal was always to acquire a book deal, and her account of her relentless attempts to get in touch with members of the Lacks family made me highly uncomfortable. Much of the latter half of the book dealt with the relationship between Skloot and Deborah, Henrietta Lacks' youngest daughter—again, uncomfortable to read about at several points, and not especially relevant to the book's main thrust. Overall, an interesting read, but I feel that The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks could easily have been edited down to half its length—and focused more on Henrietta because of it."
324,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/925949-jude,5,"it's as if the writer wanted the story the way i would want it, and self-observes the arc of her own education the way i would, so the emotional style resonated at a profound level: a combination of passion, humility & fearlessness that makes me trust the her completely, that makes me grateful she is the person who chose this story - or that it chose her.& then there's the story - the science. the race & class issues, the muck of medical ethics before patients were real people and blackfolk were real patients... that's the warp. The weft is the story of a friendship between two women meeting each other on the edge of both their worlds, brought there by Henrietta: her immortality is not simply a series of cells.the narrators are excellent. the pacing is a tiny bit slow, but that works for the direct quotes - and hearing voices in dialect anchors the story in time and place. The voices in this story - the amount of quoted text & speech- keep this story very immediate - with the feel of a good documentary or good fiction.a joy."

I tell you the premise, and that's the book. It just keeps doubling over itself to tell you the same science, the same sad story of the people it affected, and nothing ever really happens. People say things like ""hold on, are you ready for this?"" and then nothing happens. It's the same information over and over. So I'm going to spoil the whole book for you; Henrietta Lacks was a poor syphilitic black woman who married her cousin, had a bunch of kids, and died very young of an aggressive cancer, the cells of which doctors took samples of without asking and then developed into the first 'immortal' cell line, which went on to be used by scientist and doctors around the world. Her descendants are plagued by poverty and bad health. That's it. Now imagine me telling you different versions of that over and over while I also tell you about how I'm researching and writing about it, dealing with this difficult and suspicious relatives. That's the book. "

328,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"Its a very important story, its unique in its format of that the cells of Henrietta lacks are doing and how it seems that even today nobody understand why or how those cells are even still alive, BUT sadly the actual story of doctors doing something without permission is NOT a unique one, since sadly there are still today patients being used without their knowledge -as it is even stated in the book itself. And i think that especially that is something that should be taking away from this book: This story is important and interesting, but so far not much has changed in the medical field so that this type of thing does not continues to happen without permission from the patients themselves. This book does point out quiet a lot of positive things that happened because and with cells and how it could have never happened without them. Some horrendous things, some wonderful things where achieved thanks to those cells and with that thanks to Henrietta Lacks. And i am defiantly one of the first people to point out that medical advances are necessary and that we still have way to little knowledge and actual solutions for way to man illnesses! But i think that this book also points out two very important things and drives them home quiet nicely: 1. Human tissue was once part of a person!We all should respect that. Yes its important that a lot of different science fields have access to tissue samples. But its also important to remember the people that gave those samples. Be it willingly, unwillingly, during life or after their death, it was once part of a living breathing person! I think a lot of us prefer to ignore that, or try to forget it and i think that is defiantly one thing we all should work on always remembering when we take any kind of medicine without a second thought! 2. there are lot of loopholes legally that should be worked on!All this talk of ""technically it wasn't required"" in this book just made me want to shake someone! What it comes down to in very basic forms -especially in regards of this specific book and the story it tells- is that everyone should be asking for permission. Doctors and scientists should explain in understandable terms what they want and why it could be helpful and i am pretty sure that a lot of people -especially those with illnesses!- will be more than willing to hand out tissue samples for further use! No need to just take them without asking! So why do it?Which brings it all back to the first point: lets not forget all those ""samples"" actually come from someone that is not just there to be a lab-rat!Now the one ""negative"" thing of this book is that i personally didn't really like how the Skloot wrote this book. Some sections felt as if she wanted to get that particular part of the story told and done with as fast as possible and shoved a lot of details and information into a pretty small section and number of pages. And than sometimes she would go on and on about some things for endless number of pages that i personally felt that it wasn't necessary to go on about it for that long. To say it short it is not he best nonfiction writing i have read. BUT its also far from the worst. Its very readable and yes it could have been kept a little shorter, but all in all it was done pretty well in the writing department. of course that is completely personal and some of the reviews i read LOVED the writing, so clearly that part is debatable.If you are interested in this book, defiantly give it a try. If you are going into a scientific field? Defiantly read this!"
329,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,"A book like this makes me realize how important education in general and particularly science education is. Today’s science is yesterday’s magic—for those who don’t understand science, it can seem like very frightening black magic. The story of Henrietta Lacks explores the intersection between science, research, education, capitalism, civil rights, and consent.The major question implicit in this book is whether we have any claim to our own cells after they have been removed from our bodies. Is it ethical to take “discarded” cells—those left over after medical procedures—and do research from them and potentially make money from either the cells or the research. This issue gets us down somewhere in our irrational subconscious—after all, we all “know” enough about voodoo and black magic to know that curses require hair, nail clippings, blood, or other bodily secretions in order to be effective. In many ways, the story of the HeLa cell line traces the history of medical research in the US (and to some extent, other countries), evolving from the exploitation of vulnerable people towards the concept of informed consent. It also traces the history of an African American family, liberated from slavery, but not from poverty and deprivation. The current distrust of science has some real roots in situations like these, where people were used without their knowledge for experimental purposes. But the lack of scientific literacy in the general population helps with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and the prevalence of medical quackery. Witness all the “miracle cures” that people buy into.

330,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,5,"Henrietta Lacks is a woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951. The cells cut from her body, because of their aptitude for growth and replication, still play a significant role in treating disease and other medical tests. She did not know her cells were being used, and her family did not benefit financially. The author writes extensively about her family, as they were a crucial source for the book. Because of so many trust relationships violated over the years, she had to first work to build trust and prove herself reliable. She went on to establish a trust for the family.This book discusses science, both the present state of medicine while Henrietta was being treated for cervical cancer (nothing short of radium tube inserts and lead!) and how science has grown in its understandings and treatments because of her cells. The book has to address the ways African Americans have been treated badly by the American medical establishment from Tuskagee to forced sterilizations, to even some patients injected with Henrietta's cells without their knowledge! I felt like I knew much of the story already, but only because this book has received so much acclaim and press, and I find rightly so. I'm not a scientist but felt I could understand it as Skloot presented the information.I also learned some terrifying things that don't soothe my paranoia. Huge government stores of cells that no longer belong to you - not owning the rights to your bodily tissue - still all true in the 21st century. Ever wonder where your blood, teeth, etc. got to? Ha. I read this during Banned Books Week 2015 because earlier this year it was challenged by a Tennessee mother who felt it was ""pornographic."" The woman had cervical cancer, cancer of the CERVIX, a body part all women have. Oh please. This book isn't pornography, it's science. Discussed on Episode 042 of the Reading Envy Podcast."
331,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186579-kate,1,"This book irritated me from the beginning. It couldn't decide if it was a history of the cells, the life story of one woman, a chronicle of how an author tracks down the life story of a woman, a position paper on racism, a position paper on human tissue ownership, or a position paper on disorganized rhetoric. I think it was all of those, and it drove me absolutely up the wall.As a history of the HeLa cells ... I read a Wired article that was better.As the life story of Henrietta Lacks ... it read like a list of facts instead of a human interest piece. And it kept going on tangents (with the life stories of each of her children, her doctors, etc.)As the story of the author tracking down a story ... that was actually kind of interesting.As a position paper on racism...it had a lot of disturbing stories - but no cohesive point.As a position paper on human tissue ownership... the best chapter was the last one, which actually listed facts and laws. And while the author clearly had an opinion in that chapter -it was more focused and less full of unrelated stories intended to pull on your hearts strings and shift your opinion.As a position paper on disorganized rhetoric...it was a stellar exemplar."
332,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"I don't know how many copies of a book need to be sold before it can be fairly described as a best-seller. In any case what kind of bearing does the number of copies sold have on the amount that a book is read? The success of Rebecca Skloot's book is maybe entirely unsurprising as it covers a wide range of angles and caters for many tastes. It has something of the ever popular misery mémoire, some social history, an investigative aspect with detective road trips, along with an exploration of one of the wonders of modern science. All of this comes together in two alternating narrative strands, the death of Henrietta Lacks from cancer and the strange ongoing life and use of a tissue sample collected from her that has been used for a host of purposes from cancer research to gene mapping to assessing human sensitivity to commercial products, as well as the impact of her life and death on her young family. As a whole it was a moving reading experience.The story told is a very simple one, and I found how it is told completely effective. It is not surprising that some forms of cancer, even with treatment, are fatal. It is not surprising that poor black people in the USA remain poor over time, it is not surprising that difficult childhood experiences can overshadow later adult lives, it is even not surprising that something if not entirely free to obtain like the tissue sample in question, has come to be a source of profit for many companies while providing no benefit to either the donor’s family nor the institution which provided Henrietta Lacks with medical treatment and collected the sample in the first place. Perhaps part of the success of Skloot's narration is just how unsurprising those elements of the story are juxtaposed with the completely unexpected survival and continuing life of Henrietta Lacks' tissue sample. There is a recognisable slice of life married with something unique so far in science and of enduring scientific impact.For me the most serious downside is that I had the feeling that Skloot had hoped her book might start a public debate on issues of sample ownership, but so far that discussion so far has not escaped the courts. That leaves us with a great piece of non-fiction writing rather than a rallying cry for change."
333,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,5,"In reading non-fiction, and particularly scientific non-fiction, my two most frequent gripes are: a lack of personal story, and a lack of overall narrative. It's my opinion that just because a work isn't fiction, it shouldn't miss out on the use of structural elements more common to fiction: a strong narrative and narrative structure can improve any kind of communication.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a near-flawless implementation of this. The book has three components: the story of Henrietta and her family, the story of the science made possible by Henrietta, and the story of the author, Skloot, researching the book. I can't stress enough how effectively these three threads are woven together, making a educational, intersectional, and ultimately tragic story. If you are interested in the human side of scientific advance then this is an absolute, absolute must-read. Highly recommended."
334,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50066399-diane-in-australia,4,"Henrietta was the woman whose cultured cells ... the first to grow and survive indefinitely ... were taken without her knowledge. They turned out to be very essential to modern medical advancements.I found this to be an interesting book, mainly because it taught me a few science/medical bits, and it made me think more deeply about ethical issues related to tissue ownership. As always, I enjoyed the close-up views of racial issues.I'm glad that the author wrote this book, as I'm sure it helped Henrietta's family understand what really took place all those years ago. It also makes all of us aware of the debt we owe to Henrietta.4 Stars = Outstanding. It definitely held my interest."
335,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5036644-meredith-o-donnell,2,"Interesting concept. Reading it with my book club... Upate: Finished. I am always up for a rousing ethical debate. The deplorable breach of privacy, a basic human right, displayed in the book was appalling. Anyone who has ever been dehumanized can relate to the way Henrietta was objectified for the sake of science. It was beyond unconscionable. I am glad the story was told. I hope that Skloot's efforts will remind the industry of science and medicine that they need to be held accountable for their actions, and the finished product is not the only thing that matters, but the methods taken on their road to discovery count as well. Henrietta's cells have provided mankind with a lot to be grateful for, and for that we must thank the scientists and doctors who worked feverishly and masterfully, experimenting and coming up with new ideas. However, the people behind the cells have rights too. Bioethics have come a long way since the 1950's, but there are still flaws.  I learned in several journalism courses I took in college that the job of the journalist is to hold accountable those who serve the public--be it in politics, consumerism, or medicine. That is what Skloot has done by tackling the story of Henrietta Lacks--the person behind the immortal HeLa cell line. For that, I commend her. While I agreed with the endeavor, I had a few issues with her strategy. As others have mentioned, she placed herself in the story excessively. She claimed it was necessary, but I doubt if it was necessary to the extent that she did it. She seemed to want to constantly remind the reader of her plight. This is not the place of a journalist--just tell the story, don't tell your own story of getting the story. Also, she had an incredibly obvious bias, and a suspiciously not-so-obvious agenda. I did question Skloot's intentions. She spoke as an advocate for the Lacks family, but I do wonder whether or not she was a welcomed one, or a useful one.  She classifies the book as nonfiction upfront. And that it is. Or was intended to be... the story is real. But the details were so convoluted, shrouded and murky that it became difficult to truly believe with any authority one thing or the other. For instance, Skloot admits that the medical field was not proficient in recording things during this time (no computer.) Consequently, a lot of important details concerning Henrietta's illness, diagnosis, the retrieval of her cells, her death, her autopsy, her burial, among other factors, were not clearly documented. Also, Skloot's main sources of information were the Lacks family--a family frought with incest, disease, mental illness, partial deafness, drug abuse, a lack of intelligence and a lack of education--none of which was their fault, but all of which made them unreliable sources of information. For instance-- did Henrietta ever meet Gey? His assistant Mary swears yes. But Dave Lacks says absolutely not. The tie breaker is dead..and was on her death bed/twisted with pain/heavily medicated during the time of the alleged meeting so it is not out of the realm of possibilities that she either forgot about the encounter or didn't think to bring it up. It's also just as possible that Mary was confused (no documentation,) or was lying. I have no reason to believe one over the other. Also, Joe's murder. Skloot decided to present the family's convenient recollection of events authoritatively--that it was self defense. However, a witness testified under oath that the fatal attack was unprovoked. Again, I have no incentive to take one side over the other, but Skloot's selective storytelling contributed to my distrust of her as a narrator, a writer and a reporter.  When I read a nonfiction piece, I prefer for the facts to be indisputable. Aside from credibility issues, I also questioned Skloot's true motives. She hid behind an ultra-liberal facade: a sympathetic crusader who was empowering this poor, uneducated family with the voice they never had. But notice how she proudly boasts of a deep friendship with Deborah Lacks in the beginning of the book... but I wonder if Deborah, God rest her soul, would confirm this claim. We'll never know. Skloot seemed to pester the family, while at the same time condemning those who did the same...as if her reasons were more pure and justifiable. She also clearly lamented their lack of medical coverage and financial compensation, and a portion of the proceeds for the book will go to a scholarship fund for the family, but why didn't she just write them a big check? They didn't benefit directly. If you read closely, Skloot reveals that she had to agree to certain conditions before the Lacks family would agree to talk to her. She had to tell the family's story exactly the way it was told to her, whether facts were verified or not. She was so desperate to satisfy, what started out as her own morbid curiosity, and grew into an obsessive mission, that she agreed to this stipulation. That almost concealed little tidbit, combined with the unreliability and untrustworthiness of the medical profession during that time, left this reader skeptical of nearly every word. However, the subject matter and her insistance to reinstate the human side to a research subject, as well as the fact that Skloot manages to make very technical terminology and notions perfectly clear to a former B student in Biology, earn the writer one star each. I recommend reading along side Oliver Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat-- another nonfiction piece about the humanization of patients. Meredith O'Donnell"
336,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is fascinating and heartbreaking in equal measure. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Before she died, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in cultures for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory. Those cells, known as HeLa, are still alive today and have advanced medicine and science in countless ways; it seems there's no end to the list of discoveries made because of HeLa.I've tried to imagine how [Henrietta would] feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. Henrietta's cells helped launch the fledgling field of virology. As the Cold War escalated, some scientists exposed Henrietta's cells to massive doses of radiation to study how nuclear bombs destroyed cells and find ways to reverse that damage. Others put them in special centrifuges that spun so fast the pressure inside was more than 100,000 times that of gravity, to see what happened to human cells under the extreme conditions of deep-sea diving or spaceflight. The author took great care to learn about Henrietta Lacks. She paints Henrietta as a woman who accepted her illness and faced her treatment with unparalleled resilience and strength. One afternoon, as Henrietta lay on the couch, she lifted her shirt to show Margaret and Sadie what the treatments had done to her. Sadie gasped: The skin from Henrietta's breasts to her pelvis was charred a deep black from the radiation. The rest of her body was its normal shade -- more the color of fawn than coal. ""Hennie,"" she whispered, ""they burn you black as tar."" Henrietta just nodded and said, ""Lord, it just feels like that blackness be spreadin all inside me."" Cancer is a foul creature, sinister and terrifying, but Henrietta's cancer was a force of evil from the nadir of Hell. It ravaged her body in unmerciful ways; it's no wonder those cells survived in a test tube where all other cells died. Suddenly [Henrietta's] body went rigid as a board. She screamed as the nurse ran to the bed, tightening the straps around Henrietta's arms and legs to keep her from thrashing onto the floor as she'd done many times before. Gladys thrust the pillow from her lap into Henrietta's mouth, to keep her from biting her tongue as she convulsed in pain. The book is extensive; all of the information is efficiently organized and comprehensive. Part of what makes this book so tantalizing are all of the near-misses, all of the moments when the author was turned down in her quest to learn the truth about Henrietta Lacks. Had she given up, as so many others did, Henrietta Lacks might have been forgotten and this riveting book would have never existed. "
337,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6942006-suzy,5,"I was completely in the thrall of author Rebecca Skloot while listening to the audio of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. This is at once a scientific story of Henrietta's cancer cells, called HeLa, which were harvested from her as she was dying from cervical cancer in 1951. These are the first human cells to become ""immortal"", perpetuating themselves even to today, and being used in many important health discoveries including polio vaccines, in vitro fertilization, aids research, cancer drugs and too many others to mention. It is also the story of Henrietta and her family, who had no idea that their mother's cells were taken or the importance of the cells to medicine. Her children learn about this from Skloot's research and this knowledge causes misunderstandings and various reactions in Henrietta's adult children from some wanting financial remuneration to others just wanting their mother to be honored and respected for her contribution to science. My heart went out to Henrietta and her family who, because they were poor and black, were treated, and lived, as second class citizens. They are often at the mercy of their many health problems through lack of education, lack of access to health insurance and suspicions about the medical establishment. It seems so unjust! (Thanks to GR friend Will Byrnes for posting this NY Times article on the consent agreement reached with the family finally . . . 62 years later. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/sci...)At first I found the structure of the book a little frustrating because it jumped in both time and storyline, but once I decided to just flow with it, I was completely engaged. I think listening helped. It was as if the author was telling her story just to me, and that I was discovering it side-by-side with her. There are so many layers, that my thought is there's something to connect to for everyone based on a reader's interests coming to the book. Skloot reveals early in the book that she learned about HeLa in a biology class when she was younger and decided then and there to research and write about them. Little did she know that she would be telling the story of the Lacks family right along with the scientific importance of the cells. I appreciated the interview at the end of the audio where Skloot tells us how she decided on the focus and the structure of the book. This was the February book club pick at our wonderful art museum here in Minneapolis, and I enjoyed the discussion. I'm eagerly anticipating the HBO movie based on the book which will be aired April 22 here in the States. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5686132/"

The list of her contributions to science go on and on.Henrietta’s cells were taken without her permission or knowledge in early 1951. More than twenty years would pass before her family ever found out. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is Henrietta’s story, the story of her cell’s contribution to science, and the story of her family. I learned a lot from this book about Henrietta, science, and past and present patient rights in the United States. Some of the information found on these pages are truly alarming.

The fact that her family can't even get reliable health insurance really just adds insult to injury. This is a well-researched, well-written book. The issue it discusses is extremely important, and the last chapter about tissue ownership is outright terrifying. It was the first time I heard of ""gene patents"" (what?), and this:Myriad Genetics, which holds the patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes responsible for most cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, charges $3,000 to test for the genes. Myriad has been accused of creating a monopoly, since no one else can offer the test, and researchers can’t develop cheaper tests or new therapies without getting permission from Myriad and paying steep licensing fees. Scientists who’ve gone ahead with research involving the breast-cancer genes without Myriad’s permission have found themselves on the receiving end of cease-and-desist letters and threats of litigation.I don't know what to say. I think this paragraph sums it up very well:
The debate over the commercialization of human biological materials always comes back to one fundamental point: like it or not, we live in a market-driven society, and science is part of that market. Baruch Blumberg, the Nobel Prize-winning researcher who used Ted Slavin’s antibodies for hepatitis B research, told me, “Whether you think the commercialization of medical research is good or bad depends on how into capitalism you are.” On the whole, Blumberg said, commercialization is good; how else would we get the drugs and diagnostic tests we need? Still, he sees a downside. “I think it’s fair to say it’s interfered with science,” he said. “It’s changed the spirit.” Now there are patents and proprietary information where there once was free information flow. “Researchers have become entrepreneurs. That’s boomed our economy and created incentives to do research. But it’s also brought problems, like secrecy and arguments over who owns what.”

343,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,5,"This is a phenomenal book. If it doesn't win every non-fiction award for 2010 than whoever votes for non-fiction awards should have their library cards taken away from them*.The author, Rebecca Skloot, does a masterful job of seamlessly weaving in the scientific story of Henrietta Lacks' immortal cells and the effect they have had on medicine and medical ethics with a real human interest story about Henrietta and the struggles of her family. Skloot does this without coming across as maudlin, preachy, overly technical, guilt ridden, condescending, or just plain boring. She deftly weaves two legs of one story together, darting in and out with ease and keeping the reader interested in learning the science and caring about the people. She does this all while doing her best to avoid passing judgment or creating villains. Like a good journalist, she simply reports the facts of a fantastically and seemingly thoroughly researched book and lets the reader interpret them as they will.In all, this is not only a terrific science book that is not afraid to tackle gray areas of ethics and leave them unanswered without getting preachy, not only a gripping human interest story with more than one human we are interested in, but also a socioeconomic look at the educational opportunities and struggles of poor, disadvantaged people across several generations of our country. Most of all though, this is a uniquely American story.*Seeing as how Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World by Liaquat Ahamed won the last Pulitzer for history, perhaps voters should have already had their library cards taken from them because that book was so bad I wouldn't even use it as a doorstop and besmirch the dignity of my door."

Her cells are another story, they continued to live on after biopsies of her cancerous tissue was taken without her permission or her family's knowledge and grown in labs to be shipped around the world to test diseases, develop gene therapy, and ultimately change the world. All the while, her children and family had no idea that this was happening, and they struggle to come to terms with what it means to have immortal cells, while the family can barely afford medical treatment.Rebecca Skloot takes a nearly impossible task of researching something that was breaking at the time, and challenges human rights to our own tissue and most importantly how client consent has changed over the past couple of decades. Fascinating story merging the lines of racial and gender discrimination, while also facing class struggles. In my opinion, this book should be required reading."
346,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9554958-sara,1,"The story behind the infamous ""HeLa"" cells are interesting to most scientists, as most of us have either worked with them, read endless research articles/journals utilizing them, and know about their contributions to science and/or medicine, among many more things. This immortal cell line was derived from Mrs. Lacks' cervical tissue, which became cancerous after she was infected with HPV. She recieved treatment for cervical canver at Johns Hopkins University, known at this time period for treating black patients. Though I don't know how her race/ethnicity/social status affected her personal treatment at the hospital, the actual medical treatment for her condition was unbiased and the normal protocol for any one with the condition. During this time period, research physicians, or physicians who were interetsed in biomedical research were striving to culture an immortal cell line, which has enormous applications and implications in biomedical research. The physicians, with the help of other scientists and technicians, were able to create a cell line that had greatly sought-after conditions for the purposes of biomedical research, inlcuding immortalization and ease of growth in culture. The use of her cells greatly impacted the field of biomedical research, and the cultivation and use of the HeLA cell line contributed to the establishment of the first Polio vaccine, cancer research, and countless other types of research where the characteristics of the HeLa cell line offer great advatange and resource for pusuit of scientific knowledge. My review of this book has nothing to do with the contributions her cells have made to the scientific community. The physicians at the time did take her cells and culture them without her consent, but that was standard protocol at the time, and she was not isolated for that purpose. We have all contributed from the use of her cells, therefore, it is hypocritical to be critical of the use of them.Despite a major attempt to create a ""boogey-man"" portrait of the physicians/scientists that worked with her cells, none of them were awarded financially for establishing the HeLa cell line. The author tries to create an image of a poor black woman who was robbed of her cells without consent and not awarded the enormous monentary prize for their use, but the truth is, this was standard procedure at that time period,and her cells just happened to actually work for that purpose. I was very interested to learn more about Mrs. Lacks in this book. What made this book impossible to read was the author. She hardly writes more than a few pages about Mrs. Lacks. She mostly wrote a biography detailing her attempts at finding information, without providing anything insightful about the actual woman it was supposed to be about, Mrs. Lacks. Most of the book is about her relatives and their immense anger and resentment about not being compensated for the use of Mrs. Lacks' cells. I don't really give a shit about that. A lot of shitty things happen to people in this world, this wasn't in any way the worst, and that would have made a decent book if that was what the book was supposed to be about. This book was so boring, I didn't even finish it. "
347,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"This book has been around for a while now, so most people know the basis. Rebecca Skloot tells the story here of Henrietta Lacks, the poor black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1951. Why do we care about Henrietta Lacks? Quite simply, her cells, which were taken without her knowledge or consent, became known as HeLa cells. Now does it sound familiar? HeLa cells have been around for a while, recognizable to many for their importance in developing the polio vaccine and gene mapping. HeLa cells have survived and grown since 1951.But Skloot recognized there was more to the science than just the letters HeLa. She set out to uncover the truth about the person behind the abbreviation. With the help of members of Lacks's family, Skloot spent about a decade on this book. She visited the now-defunct Clover, where Lacks grew up, she took Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, to the hospital where her sister, Elsie, was put away as an ""imbecile"" and where she died under suspicious circumstances. Deborah, who was four when Henrietta died, was just as committed to finding out the full story about her family as Skloot was.The book bounces around in time, from the 40s and 50s as Skloot detailed Henrietta's life and illness, to ""present day"" of 2009 when the book was published. Skloot's own journey with her research began in the late 90s. She got married and divorced during the writing of this book. She knew Henrietta Lacks was unknown by the public, even though her cells had been such a vital part of medicine and science for decades.The heartbreaking part about this real-life story is that Henrietta's descendants and family knew nothing about the HeLa cells themselves. They were never given any real explanation about the cells, nor were they compensated in any way. The book brings to light a lot of issues, from social to ethical. Most impressive is the concept that all tissue in and on your body belongs to you while it's attached to you, but as soon as it's removed from you, it's not longer ""yours"". You have no rights over it. It can be researched and sold and re-sold and modified and studies. You get no say in whether you want studies on pieces of your body to go towards the cure for cancer or for the creation of atomic bombs or other devices of mass destruction.Years ago I had a cyst removed. Thinking of a Margaret Atwood story, I asked my surgeon (and every subsequent tech and anesthesiologist whom I met prior to surgery) if I could keep my cyst once they excised it. After their initial responses of ""Ew, WHY?"" they told me that would not, could not, should not ever be available to me. ""But it's MINE"" I tried to argue. They claimed liability, and disease (not that I had a disease, but it's jut not sanitary). None of them had read the Atwood story I was referencing, but if they had, they would have been even more adamant that I should be allowed nowhere near the cyst once it had been removed.I've thought about the same thing during a breast biopsy and then more recently, when they removed my thyroid. What are they going to do with it? What I really would like, more than being able to keep these things that have been pulled from my body over the years, is frequent updates about the road my tissues have traveled. Remember in the 90s the popularity of things like adopting a star, or a whale, or a polar bear. You'd get a picture in the mail for the low-cost of whatever, and then a few updates throughout the year about where your whale is and how it is faring.That's what I want with the tissues that have been taken from me. Just a postcard with a picture of what they're doing with my tissues, a little update that says ""ElPa cell was just sold to Norway for the price of 8 million where they will study the effects of cigarette smoking on this tissue taken from your breast in the early 2000s!""As Skloot spent more time with the Lacks family, she became almost a member of the family herself. After the initial periods of suspicion and caution, Skloot was embraced and was called for all the important family births and deaths and other major life experiences. From a personal storytelling point of view, I found that touching, though it wasn't exactly a necessary part of the main story.I suppose really it means that HeLa (Henrietta Lacks) is a part of everyone, brings us all together. She continues to live, and while her family will never see any portion of the proceeds and still have no say over their mother's cells, there's some satisfaction that can be derived from how common the name Henrietta Lacks is now. The woman behind the cells should never be forgotten. Her contributions (that she didn't even know she was making) should be told. She was more than just the abbreviations HeLa.I know everyone has read this book already by this point, but it came up in my little world because I'm now on the Common Reader Committee at the university where I work. At the first meeting, it became obvious that very few of us are actually readers (one went so far as to say he doesn't like to read, which begs the question as to why he was even there). This book was one of my recommendations, even though I hadn't read it yet. My boss read the first six chapters and felt that it would cover a lot of the bases that our university likes to cover, and would appeal to the three main colleges very well by dealing with social justice issues, science and medicine, legality, ethics, and health and wellness.Now that I've read this book on my own I can go back to our meeting next week and say, holy shit guys, this book really does cover ALL the bases. The idea is this would be a book that everyone could read - every student, staff, and faculty member. While the story meanders a bit and gets a bit dry in other places, I think ultimately the story of Henrietta Lacks and her cells will appeal to all readers in the university.But if I hear one more time from anyone ""But are they mature enough for it"" I will scream. College students aren't quite as dumb as everyone likes to think they are. Maybe they're lazy, but cheese and rice, I'm not going to dumb down the Common Reader in concerns that students won't be able to read a book anymore.Plus there's an HBO movie coming out next month based on this book, so if just reading a book isn't incentive enough, maybe Oprah will be.(My other top contenders would be The Handmaid's Tale and March: Book One. Though some on the committee thinks if we give a graphic novel to college students they will think we're giving them ""cartoons"" to read and there may be an uprising. It's fascinating to me how little faculty and staff know the students at their own university. To be fair, those who suggest an uprising are also the ones who don't read, and they claim not to know how to read a graphic novel. Someone asked ""Do you start at the front or the back?"" conflating graphic novels with manga, I believe. This committee will be a long road for me. Someone just put me in charge already.)"

It chronicles the life of the woman whose cancerous tissue became the first tissue in history which could be successfully grown as culture and used in various, and countless, experiments from vaccine research to cloning. Her tissue was so successful in fact that it became virtually immortal, surviving in various environments and proliferating at prodigious rates. Yet, very little was known about the woman herself, her life, her family, her history, and this is what Skloot set out to uncover. What she found out is absolutely stunning from the point of medical ethics, American history and American healthcare. Fascinating. Highly recommended."

350,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27544898-bookishrealm,5,"This book was phenomenal in more ways than one. I knew a little bit about Henrietta Lacks, but I was definitely not aware of the extent to which her family was affected by the use of her sells in modern day biology. It broke my heart to see how her family, deeply rooted in religious beliefs, was broken because they felt as though Henrietta's soul resided in those cells. I have my own personal opinions about the entire concept of doctors taking medical waste for their own advantages. Nevertheless, what I can say about this issue is that it is stories such as the Tuskegee Experiment and the use of Henrietta's cells that have ultimately made the black community hesitant about wanting to go to doctors. I plan to do more research on this topic and it may be a project that I throw myself into. Hopefully I can find more text that really delves into the black community's experience with the medical field. This really opened my eyes to a lot of issues related to the medical field/industry and I can't wait to read more. "

I like a book that makes me think, just as I did when I was a college student. There's a fine line between what is ethically/morally ""right"" and that which infringes on a person's own being and that person's (or family of said person) rights to his/her cells. There are never any correct answers or final conclusions in the world of bioethics...it's an ongoing dispute but one that really caused me to question my own decisions and how they are interpreted."
352,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is required reading for pharmaceutical students at a nearby Oklahoma University where a friend of my daughter goes to college. She told me about this book over Christmas. I can see why it’s required reading. I’m glad it is and I hope it is for medical and research students everywhere.It tells the story of an African American woman, Henrietta Lacks, who went to Johns Hopkins in 1951 for treatment for cervical cancer. Some cancerous cells were removed from her body. This much she knew. The cells were also saved, cultured, and reproduced—without her knowledge or consent—as was common practice at the time. What makes this an amazing story is that Henrietta’s cells have never died from that day until the present, hence the title. They continue to grow and reproduce at a phenomenal rate. They currently exist in laboratories, hospitals and warehouses all over the world; have been used in almost every form of scientific research from the 50’s until now; have gone to space; have been contaminated and caused contamination. The scientific and medical communities owe untold debt to the cells it calls HeLa and yet not one dime of compensation, even in terms of discounted medical care or health insurance has ever been received by any of Henrietta’s numerous descendants. Interestingly enough, they aren’t looking for anything in that way. Now isn’t that refreshing? Rather, in spite of all they have suffered—and indeed this is a book about pain—their focal interest throughout was in finding out what happened to their mother since she died so young, gaining recognition for her and learning what happened to Henrietta’s oldest daughter who died in a ‘hospital for the negro insane’, which was 1950’s terminology.  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks crosses many disciplines and for that reason I expect scientists might skim the vignettes about Henrietta’s children, while those who prefer human interest could find themselves avoiding the technical sections. Virginia Woolf’s Common Readers, however, will positively adore this book! It has everything they look for in the written word. Not only what was just mentioned, but also: the complexities and importance of the ‘tissue issue’, what are the medical, legal, ethical, and other parameters for tissue gathering, storage, research, usage, and compensation. And I commend the author, Rebecca Skloot, a self-proclaimed non-believer for her sensitive handling of the many stressed and stressful events, issues and personalities she encountered concerning matters of faith, morals, and religion.  A very important book to read!  Here is a rather long but fascinating 1998 BBC documentary about Henrietta Lacks and HeLa.  Here is an article which gives some more current info about the Lacks family and the issue of privacy v. tissue donation. "
353,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"Henrietta Lacks, a young African-American mother of five children, died in Baltimore in 1951 from a highly aggressive form of cervical cancer—but more than fifty years after her death, part of her lives on in the form of HeLa, a cell line cultivated from a tissue sample of hers which played a key role in several major scientific and medical breakthroughs. Skloot's book tells Lacks' story, partly to pay tribute to a woman who was forgotten by all but her family for many years despite her importance to medicine; partly in order to examine the complex attendant issues of medical ethics, race and class. Skloot's writing is fluid and accessible, and I learned some things which were shocking though not surprising to me (see the organ retention scandal which broke in Ireland a few years ago). That said, I would have liked for a stronger focus on the ethics and the science aspect of the novel and less on the lives of Lacks' children and other relatives. Skloot's focus on them and on some of the more unpalatable aspects of their lives felt quite voyeuristic to me at points, recounted not because Skloot wanted to examine the effects of the vicious cycle of poverty on people's lives but because it would inject more drama into the book. The author talks at length about the less-than-pure motivations of those who had previously profited from Lacks' cells, and their refusal to compensate Lacks' family in any way, about how she was financing her research with credit cards and student loans—and yet her end-goal was always to acquire a book deal, and her account of her relentless attempts to get in touch with members of the Lacks family made me highly uncomfortable. Much of the latter half of the book dealt with the relationship between Skloot and Deborah, Henrietta Lacks' youngest daughter—again, uncomfortable to read about at several points, and not especially relevant to the book's main thrust. Overall, an interesting read, but I feel that The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks could easily have been edited down to half its length—and focused more on Henrietta because of it."
354,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/925949-jude,5,"it's as if the writer wanted the story the way i would want it, and self-observes the arc of her own education the way i would, so the emotional style resonated at a profound level: a combination of passion, humility & fearlessness that makes me trust the her completely, that makes me grateful she is the person who chose this story - or that it chose her.& then there's the story - the science. the race & class issues, the muck of medical ethics before patients were real people and blackfolk were real patients... that's the warp. The weft is the story of a friendship between two women meeting each other on the edge of both their worlds, brought there by Henrietta: her immortality is not simply a series of cells.the narrators are excellent. the pacing is a tiny bit slow, but that works for the direct quotes - and hearing voices in dialect anchors the story in time and place. The voices in this story - the amount of quoted text & speech- keep this story very immediate - with the feel of a good documentary or good fiction.a joy."
355,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3214537-sequoia-m,2,"I had heard so much about this book and was so excited to read it . . . but there's not much to read. I tell you the premise, and that's the book. It just keeps doubling over itself to tell you the same science, the same sad story of the people it affected, and nothing ever really happens. People say things like ""hold on, are you ready for this?"" and then nothing happens. It's the same information over and over. So I'm going to spoil the whole book for you; Henrietta Lacks was a poor syphilitic black woman who married her cousin, had a bunch of kids, and died very young of an aggressive cancer, the cells of which doctors took samples of without asking and then developed into the first 'immortal' cell line, which went on to be used by scientist and doctors around the world. Her descendants are plagued by poverty and bad health. That's it. Now imagine me telling you different versions of that over and over while I also tell you about how I'm researching and writing about it, dealing with this difficult and suspicious relatives. That's the book. "

Henrietta Lacks was a poor black women who cells were taken without her consent and used by many scientists to develop vaccines,cloning, and many more things. Unfortunately her family was very poor and never received any money from her cells being used.They had many health problems and could not afford health insurance and died young as a result.

358,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"Its a very important story, its unique in its format of that the cells of Henrietta lacks are doing and how it seems that even today nobody understand why or how those cells are even still alive, BUT sadly the actual story of doctors doing something without permission is NOT a unique one, since sadly there are still today patients being used without their knowledge -as it is even stated in the book itself. And i think that especially that is something that should be taking away from this book: This story is important and interesting, but so far not much has changed in the medical field so that this type of thing does not continues to happen without permission from the patients themselves. This book does point out quiet a lot of positive things that happened because and with cells and how it could have never happened without them. Some horrendous things, some wonderful things where achieved thanks to those cells and with that thanks to Henrietta Lacks. And i am defiantly one of the first people to point out that medical advances are necessary and that we still have way to little knowledge and actual solutions for way to man illnesses! But i think that this book also points out two very important things and drives them home quiet nicely: 1. Human tissue was once part of a person!We all should respect that. Yes its important that a lot of different science fields have access to tissue samples. But its also important to remember the people that gave those samples. Be it willingly, unwillingly, during life or after their death, it was once part of a living breathing person! I think a lot of us prefer to ignore that, or try to forget it and i think that is defiantly one thing we all should work on always remembering when we take any kind of medicine without a second thought! 2. there are lot of loopholes legally that should be worked on!All this talk of ""technically it wasn't required"" in this book just made me want to shake someone! What it comes down to in very basic forms -especially in regards of this specific book and the story it tells- is that everyone should be asking for permission. Doctors and scientists should explain in understandable terms what they want and why it could be helpful and i am pretty sure that a lot of people -especially those with illnesses!- will be more than willing to hand out tissue samples for further use! No need to just take them without asking! So why do it?Which brings it all back to the first point: lets not forget all those ""samples"" actually come from someone that is not just there to be a lab-rat!Now the one ""negative"" thing of this book is that i personally didn't really like how the Skloot wrote this book. Some sections felt as if she wanted to get that particular part of the story told and done with as fast as possible and shoved a lot of details and information into a pretty small section and number of pages. And than sometimes she would go on and on about some things for endless number of pages that i personally felt that it wasn't necessary to go on about it for that long. To say it short it is not he best nonfiction writing i have read. BUT its also far from the worst. Its very readable and yes it could have been kept a little shorter, but all in all it was done pretty well in the writing department. of course that is completely personal and some of the reviews i read LOVED the writing, so clearly that part is debatable.If you are interested in this book, defiantly give it a try. If you are going into a scientific field? Defiantly read this!"
359,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,"A book like this makes me realize how important education in general and particularly science education is. Today’s science is yesterday’s magic—for those who don’t understand science, it can seem like very frightening black magic. The story of Henrietta Lacks explores the intersection between science, research, education, capitalism, civil rights, and consent.The major question implicit in this book is whether we have any claim to our own cells after they have been removed from our bodies. Is it ethical to take “discarded” cells—those left over after medical procedures—and do research from them and potentially make money from either the cells or the research. This issue gets us down somewhere in our irrational subconscious—after all, we all “know” enough about voodoo and black magic to know that curses require hair, nail clippings, blood, or other bodily secretions in order to be effective. In many ways, the story of the HeLa cell line traces the history of medical research in the US (and to some extent, other countries), evolving from the exploitation of vulnerable people towards the concept of informed consent. It also traces the history of an African American family, liberated from slavery, but not from poverty and deprivation. The current distrust of science has some real roots in situations like these, where people were used without their knowledge for experimental purposes. But the lack of scientific literacy in the general population helps with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and the prevalence of medical quackery. Witness all the “miracle cures” that people buy into. One older lady that I used to work with was always pouring money into some miracle weight loss scheme or another—it didn’t seem to occur to her that if the method actually worked, it would be front page news on Time magazine, not some obscure ad in the back of a newspaper.We have to seriously question ourselves and our politicians about the quality of our educational systems. Are they being funded? Do we have enough teachers? Can poor children hope to get education equal to that of rich children?As my grandfather used to say, no education is wasted."
360,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,5,"Henrietta Lacks is a woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951. The cells cut from her body, because of their aptitude for growth and replication, still play a significant role in treating disease and other medical tests. She did not know her cells were being used, and her family did not benefit financially. The author writes extensively about her family, as they were a crucial source for the book. Because of so many trust relationships violated over the years, she had to first work to build trust and prove herself reliable. She went on to establish a trust for the family.This book discusses science, both the present state of medicine while Henrietta was being treated for cervical cancer (nothing short of radium tube inserts and lead!) and how science has grown in its understandings and treatments because of her cells. The book has to address the ways African Americans have been treated badly by the American medical establishment from Tuskagee to forced sterilizations, to even some patients injected with Henrietta's cells without their knowledge! I felt like I knew much of the story already, but only because this book has received so much acclaim and press, and I find rightly so. I'm not a scientist but felt I could understand it as Skloot presented the information.I also learned some terrifying things that don't soothe my paranoia. Huge government stores of cells that no longer belong to you - not owning the rights to your bodily tissue - still all true in the 21st century. Ever wonder where your blood, teeth, etc. got to? Ha. I read this during Banned Books Week 2015 because earlier this year it was challenged by a Tennessee mother who felt it was ""pornographic."" The woman had cervical cancer, cancer of the CERVIX, a body part all women have. Oh please. This book isn't pornography, it's science. Discussed on Episode 042 of the Reading Envy Podcast."
361,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186579-kate,1,"This book irritated me from the beginning. It couldn't decide if it was a history of the cells, the life story of one woman, a chronicle of how an author tracks down the life story of a woman, a position paper on racism, a position paper on human tissue ownership, or a position paper on disorganized rhetoric. I think it was all of those, and it drove me absolutely up the wall.As a history of the HeLa cells ... I read a Wired article that was better.As the life story of Henrietta Lacks ... it read like a list of facts instead of a human interest piece. And it kept going on tangents (with the life stories of each of her children, her doctors, etc.)As the story of the author tracking down a story ... that was actually kind of interesting.As a position paper on racism...it had a lot of disturbing stories - but no cohesive point.As a position paper on human tissue ownership... the best chapter was the last one, which actually listed facts and laws. And while the author clearly had an opinion in that chapter -it was more focused and less full of unrelated stories intended to pull on your hearts strings and shift your opinion.As a position paper on disorganized rhetoric...it was a stellar exemplar."

In any case what kind of bearing does the number of copies sold have on the amount that a book is read? The success of Rebecca Skloot's book is maybe entirely unsurprising as it covers a wide range of angles and caters for many tastes. It has something of the ever popular misery mémoire, some social history, an investigative aspect with detective road trips, along with an exploration of one of the wonders of modern science. All of this comes together in two alternating narrative strands, the death of Henrietta Lacks from cancer and the strange ongoing life and use of a tissue sample collected from her that has been used for a host of purposes from cancer research to gene mapping to assessing human sensitivity to commercial products, as well as the impact of her life and death on her young family. As a whole it was a moving reading experience.The story told is a very simple one, and I found how it is told completely effective. It is not surprising that some forms of cancer, even with treatment, are fatal. It is not surprising that poor black people in the USA remain poor over time, it is not surprising that difficult childhood experiences can overshadow later adult lives, it is even not surprising that something if not entirely free to obtain like the tissue sample in question, has come to be a source of profit for many companies while providing no benefit to either the donor’s family nor the institution which provided Henrietta Lacks with medical treatment and collected the sample in the first place. Perhaps part of the success of Skloot's narration is just how unsurprising those elements of the story are juxtaposed with the completely unexpected survival and continuing life of Henrietta Lacks' tissue sample. There is a recognisable slice of life married with something unique so far in science and of enduring scientific impact.For me the most serious downside is that I had the feeling that Skloot had hoped her book might start a public debate on issues of sample ownership, but so far that discussion so far has not escaped the courts. That leaves us with a great piece of non-fiction writing rather than a rallying cry for change."
363,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,5,"In reading non-fiction, and particularly scientific non-fiction, my two most frequent gripes are: a lack of personal story, and a lack of overall narrative. It's my opinion that just because a work isn't fiction, it shouldn't miss out on the use of structural elements more common to fiction: a strong narrative and narrative structure can improve any kind of communication.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a near-flawless implementation of this. The book has three components: the story of Henrietta and her family, the story of the science made possible by Henrietta, and the story of the author, Skloot, researching the book. I can't stress enough how effectively these three threads are woven together, making a educational, intersectional, and ultimately tragic story. If you are interested in the human side of scientific advance then this is an absolute, absolute must-read. Highly recommended."

They turned out to be very essential to modern medical advancements.I found this to be an interesting book, mainly because it taught me a few science/medical bits, and it made me think more deeply about ethical issues related to tissue ownership. As always, I enjoyed the close-up views of racial issues.I'm glad that the author wrote this book, as I'm sure it helped Henrietta's family understand what really took place all those years ago.

365,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5036644-meredith-o-donnell,2,"Interesting concept. Reading it with my book club... Upate: Finished. I am always up for a rousing ethical debate. The deplorable breach of privacy, a basic human right, displayed in the book was appalling. Anyone who has ever been dehumanized can relate to the way Henrietta was objectified for the sake of science. It was beyond unconscionable. I am glad the story was told. I hope that Skloot's efforts will remind the industry of science and medicine that they need to be held accountable for their actions, and the finished product is not the only thing that matters, but the methods taken on their road to discovery count as well. Henrietta's cells have provided mankind with a lot to be grateful for, and for that we must thank the scientists and doctors who worked feverishly and masterfully, experimenting and coming up with new ideas. However, the people behind the cells have rights too. Bioethics have come a long way since the 1950's, but there are still flaws.  I learned in several journalism courses I took in college that the job of the journalist is to hold accountable those who serve the public--be it in politics, consumerism, or medicine. That is what Skloot has done by tackling the story of Henrietta Lacks--the person behind the immortal HeLa cell line. For that, I commend her. While I agreed with the endeavor, I had a few issues with her strategy. As others have mentioned, she placed herself in the story excessively. She claimed it was necessary, but I doubt if it was necessary to the extent that she did it. She seemed to want to constantly remind the reader of her plight. This is not the place of a journalist--just tell the story, don't tell your own story of getting the story. Also, she had an incredibly obvious bias, and a suspiciously not-so-obvious agenda. I did question Skloot's intentions. She spoke as an advocate for the Lacks family, but I do wonder whether or not she was a welcomed one, or a useful one.  She classifies the book as nonfiction upfront. And that it is. Or was intended to be... the story is real. But the details were so convoluted, shrouded and murky that it became difficult to truly believe with any authority one thing or the other. For instance, Skloot admits that the medical field was not proficient in recording things during this time (no computer.) Consequently, a lot of important details concerning Henrietta's illness, diagnosis, the retrieval of her cells, her death, her autopsy, her burial, among other factors, were not clearly documented. Also, Skloot's main sources of information were the Lacks family--a family frought with incest, disease, mental illness, partial deafness, drug abuse, a lack of intelligence and a lack of education--none of which was their fault, but all of which made them unreliable sources of information. For instance-- did Henrietta ever meet Gey? His assistant Mary swears yes. But Dave Lacks says absolutely not. The tie breaker is dead..and was on her death bed/twisted with pain/heavily medicated during the time of the alleged meeting so it is not out of the realm of possibilities that she either forgot about the encounter or didn't think to bring it up. It's also just as possible that Mary was confused (no documentation,) or was lying. I have no reason to believe one over the other. Also, Joe's murder. Skloot decided to present the family's convenient recollection of events authoritatively--that it was self defense. However, a witness testified under oath that the fatal attack was unprovoked. Again, I have no incentive to take one side over the other, but Skloot's selective storytelling contributed to my distrust of her as a narrator, a writer and a reporter.  When I read a nonfiction piece, I prefer for the facts to be indisputable. Aside from credibility issues, I also questioned Skloot's true motives. She hid behind an ultra-liberal facade: a sympathetic crusader who was empowering this poor, uneducated family with the voice they never had. But notice how she proudly boasts of a deep friendship with Deborah Lacks in the beginning of the book... but I wonder if Deborah, God rest her soul, would confirm this claim. We'll never know. Skloot seemed to pester the family, while at the same time condemning those who did the same...as if her reasons were more pure and justifiable. She also clearly lamented their lack of medical coverage and financial compensation, and a portion of the proceeds for the book will go to a scholarship fund for the family, but why didn't she just write them a big check? They didn't benefit directly. If you read closely, Skloot reveals that she had to agree to certain conditions before the Lacks family would agree to talk to her. She had to tell the family's story exactly the way it was told to her, whether facts were verified or not. She was so desperate to satisfy, what started out as her own morbid curiosity, and grew into an obsessive mission, that she agreed to this stipulation. That almost concealed little tidbit, combined with the unreliability and untrustworthiness of the medical profession during that time, left this reader skeptical of nearly every word. However, the subject matter and her insistance to reinstate the human side to a research subject, as well as the fact that Skloot manages to make very technical terminology and notions perfectly clear to a former B student in Biology, earn the writer one star each. I recommend reading along side Oliver Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat-- another nonfiction piece about the humanization of patients. Meredith O'Donnell"
366,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is fascinating and heartbreaking in equal measure. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Before she died, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in cultures for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory. Those cells, known as HeLa, are still alive today and have advanced medicine and science in countless ways; it seems there's no end to the list of discoveries made because of HeLa.I've tried to imagine how [Henrietta would] feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. Henrietta's cells helped launch the fledgling field of virology. As the Cold War escalated, some scientists exposed Henrietta's cells to massive doses of radiation to study how nuclear bombs destroyed cells and find ways to reverse that damage. Others put them in special centrifuges that spun so fast the pressure inside was more than 100,000 times that of gravity, to see what happened to human cells under the extreme conditions of deep-sea diving or spaceflight. The author took great care to learn about Henrietta Lacks. She paints Henrietta as a woman who accepted her illness and faced her treatment with unparalleled resilience and strength. One afternoon, as Henrietta lay on the couch, she lifted her shirt to show Margaret and Sadie what the treatments had done to her. Sadie gasped: The skin from Henrietta's breasts to her pelvis was charred a deep black from the radiation. The rest of her body was its normal shade -- more the color of fawn than coal. ""Hennie,"" she whispered, ""they burn you black as tar."" Henrietta just nodded and said, ""Lord, it just feels like that blackness be spreadin all inside me."" Cancer is a foul creature, sinister and terrifying, but Henrietta's cancer was a force of evil from the nadir of Hell. It ravaged her body in unmerciful ways; it's no wonder those cells survived in a test tube where all other cells died. Suddenly [Henrietta's] body went rigid as a board. She screamed as the nurse ran to the bed, tightening the straps around Henrietta's arms and legs to keep her from thrashing onto the floor as she'd done many times before. Gladys thrust the pillow from her lap into Henrietta's mouth, to keep her from biting her tongue as she convulsed in pain. The book is extensive; all of the information is efficiently organized and comprehensive. Part of what makes this book so tantalizing are all of the near-misses, all of the moments when the author was turned down in her quest to learn the truth about Henrietta Lacks. Had she given up, as so many others did, Henrietta Lacks might have been forgotten and this riveting book would have never existed. "
367,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6942006-suzy,5,"I was completely in the thrall of author Rebecca Skloot while listening to the audio of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. This is at once a scientific story of Henrietta's cancer cells, called HeLa, which were harvested from her as she was dying from cervical cancer in 1951. These are the first human cells to become ""immortal"", perpetuating themselves even to today, and being used in many important health discoveries including polio vaccines, in vitro fertilization, aids research, cancer drugs and too many others to mention. It is also the story of Henrietta and her family, who had no idea that their mother's cells were taken or the importance of the cells to medicine. Her children learn about this from Skloot's research and this knowledge causes misunderstandings and various reactions in Henrietta's adult children from some wanting financial remuneration to others just wanting their mother to be honored and respected for her contribution to science. My heart went out to Henrietta and her family who, because they were poor and black, were treated, and lived, as second class citizens. They are often at the mercy of their many health problems through lack of education, lack of access to health insurance and suspicions about the medical establishment. It seems so unjust! (Thanks to GR friend Will Byrnes for posting this NY Times article on the consent agreement reached with the family finally . . . 62 years later. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/sci...)At first I found the structure of the book a little frustrating because it jumped in both time and storyline, but once I decided to just flow with it, I was completely engaged. I think listening helped. It was as if the author was telling her story just to me, and that I was discovering it side-by-side with her. There are so many layers, that my thought is there's something to connect to for everyone based on a reader's interests coming to the book. Skloot reveals early in the book that she learned about HeLa in a biology class when she was younger and decided then and there to research and write about them. Little did she know that she would be telling the story of the Lacks family right along with the scientific importance of the cells. I appreciated the interview at the end of the audio where Skloot tells us how she decided on the focus and the structure of the book. This was the February book club pick at our wonderful art museum here in Minneapolis, and I enjoyed the discussion. I'm eagerly anticipating the HBO movie based on the book which will be aired April 22 here in the States. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5686132/"

It was her cells that helped discover the polio vaccine, DNA mapping, cloning, and so much more. Because of Henrietta, we know how massive doses of radiation affect the human body, and also what cells do in a zero gravity environment. The list of her contributions to science go on and on.Henrietta’s cells were taken without her permission or knowledge in early 1951. More than twenty years would pass before her family ever found out. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is Henrietta’s story, the story of her cell’s contribution to science, and the story of her family. I learned a lot from this book about Henrietta, science, and past and present patient rights in the United States. Some of the information found on these pages are truly alarming. Rebecca Skloot did a thorough and diligent job with her research, and her writing is exceptional. I’m grateful to Rebecca for telling Henrietta’s story!"

The fact that her family can't even get reliable health insurance really just adds insult to injury. This is a well-researched, well-written book. The issue it discusses is extremely important, and the last chapter about tissue ownership is outright terrifying. It was the first time I heard of ""gene patents"" (what?), and this:Myriad Genetics, which holds the patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes responsible for most cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, charges $3,000 to test for the genes. Myriad has been accused of creating a monopoly, since no one else can offer the test, and researchers can’t develop cheaper tests or new therapies without getting permission from Myriad and paying steep licensing fees. Scientists who’ve gone ahead with research involving the breast-cancer genes without Myriad’s permission have found themselves on the receiving end of cease-and-desist letters and threats of litigation.I don't know what to say. I think this paragraph sums it up very well:
The debate over the commercialization of human biological materials always comes back to one fundamental point: like it or not, we live in a market-driven society, and science is part of that market. Baruch Blumberg, the Nobel Prize-winning researcher who used Ted Slavin’s antibodies for hepatitis B research, told me, “Whether you think the commercialization of medical research is good or bad depends on how into capitalism you are.” On the whole, Blumberg said, commercialization is good; how else would we get the drugs and diagnostic tests we need? Still, he sees a downside. “I think it’s fair to say it’s interfered with science,” he said. “It’s changed the spirit.” Now there are patents and proprietary information where there once was free information flow. “Researchers have become entrepreneurs. That’s boomed our economy and created incentives to do research. But it’s also brought problems, like secrecy and arguments over who owns what.”

373,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,5,"This is a phenomenal book. If it doesn't win every non-fiction award for 2010 than whoever votes for non-fiction awards should have their library cards taken away from them*.The author, Rebecca Skloot, does a masterful job of seamlessly weaving in the scientific story of Henrietta Lacks' immortal cells and the effect they have had on medicine and medical ethics with a real human interest story about Henrietta and the struggles of her family. Skloot does this without coming across as maudlin, preachy, overly technical, guilt ridden, condescending, or just plain boring. She deftly weaves two legs of one story together, darting in and out with ease and keeping the reader interested in learning the science and caring about the people. She does this all while doing her best to avoid passing judgment or creating villains. Like a good journalist, she simply reports the facts of a fantastically and seemingly thoroughly researched book and lets the reader interpret them as they will.In all, this is not only a terrific science book that is not afraid to tackle gray areas of ethics and leave them unanswered without getting preachy, not only a gripping human interest story with more than one human we are interested in, but also a socioeconomic look at the educational opportunities and struggles of poor, disadvantaged people across several generations of our country. Most of all though, this is a uniquely American story.*Seeing as how Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World by Liaquat Ahamed won the last Pulitzer for history, perhaps voters should have already had their library cards taken from them because that book was so bad I wouldn't even use it as a doorstop and besmirch the dignity of my door."

Her cells are another story, they continued to live on after biopsies of her cancerous tissue was taken without her permission or her family's knowledge and grown in labs to be shipped around the world to test diseases, develop gene therapy, and ultimately change the world. All the while, her children and family had no idea that this was happening, and they struggle to come to terms with what it means to have immortal cells, while the family can barely afford medical treatment.Rebecca Skloot takes a nearly impossible task of researching something that was breaking at the time, and challenges human rights to our own tissue and most importantly how client consent has changed over the past couple of decades. Fascinating story merging the lines of racial and gender discrimination, while also facing class struggles. In my opinion, this book should be required reading."
376,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9554958-sara,1,"The story behind the infamous ""HeLa"" cells are interesting to most scientists, as most of us have either worked with them, read endless research articles/journals utilizing them, and know about their contributions to science and/or medicine, among many more things. This immortal cell line was derived from Mrs. Lacks' cervical tissue, which became cancerous after she was infected with HPV. She recieved treatment for cervical canver at Johns Hopkins University, known at this time period for treating black patients. Though I don't know how her race/ethnicity/social status affected her personal treatment at the hospital, the actual medical treatment for her condition was unbiased and the normal protocol for any one with the condition. During this time period, research physicians, or physicians who were interetsed in biomedical research were striving to culture an immortal cell line, which has enormous applications and implications in biomedical research. The physicians, with the help of other scientists and technicians, were able to create a cell line that had greatly sought-after conditions for the purposes of biomedical research, inlcuding immortalization and ease of growth in culture. The use of her cells greatly impacted the field of biomedical research, and the cultivation and use of the HeLA cell line contributed to the establishment of the first Polio vaccine, cancer research, and countless other types of research where the characteristics of the HeLa cell line offer great advatange and resource for pusuit of scientific knowledge. My review of this book has nothing to do with the contributions her cells have made to the scientific community. The physicians at the time did take her cells and culture them without her consent, but that was standard protocol at the time, and she was not isolated for that purpose. We have all contributed from the use of her cells, therefore, it is hypocritical to be critical of the use of them.Despite a major attempt to create a ""boogey-man"" portrait of the physicians/scientists that worked with her cells, none of them were awarded financially for establishing the HeLa cell line. The author tries to create an image of a poor black woman who was robbed of her cells without consent and not awarded the enormous monentary prize for their use, but the truth is, this was standard procedure at that time period,and her cells just happened to actually work for that purpose. I was very interested to learn more about Mrs. Lacks in this book. What made this book impossible to read was the author. She hardly writes more than a few pages about Mrs. Lacks. She mostly wrote a biography detailing her attempts at finding information, without providing anything insightful about the actual woman it was supposed to be about, Mrs. Lacks. Most of the book is about her relatives and their immense anger and resentment about not being compensated for the use of Mrs. Lacks' cells. I don't really give a shit about that. A lot of shitty things happen to people in this world, this wasn't in any way the worst, and that would have made a decent book if that was what the book was supposed to be about. This book was so boring, I didn't even finish it. "
377,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"This book has been around for a while now, so most people know the basis. Rebecca Skloot tells the story here of Henrietta Lacks, the poor black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1951. Why do we care about Henrietta Lacks? Quite simply, her cells, which were taken without her knowledge or consent, became known as HeLa cells. Now does it sound familiar? HeLa cells have been around for a while, recognizable to many for their importance in developing the polio vaccine and gene mapping. HeLa cells have survived and grown since 1951.But Skloot recognized there was more to the science than just the letters HeLa. She set out to uncover the truth about the person behind the abbreviation. With the help of members of Lacks's family, Skloot spent about a decade on this book. She visited the now-defunct Clover, where Lacks grew up, she took Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, to the hospital where her sister, Elsie, was put away as an ""imbecile"" and where she died under suspicious circumstances. Deborah, who was four when Henrietta died, was just as committed to finding out the full story about her family as Skloot was.The book bounces around in time, from the 40s and 50s as Skloot detailed Henrietta's life and illness, to ""present day"" of 2009 when the book was published. Skloot's own journey with her research began in the late 90s. She got married and divorced during the writing of this book. She knew Henrietta Lacks was unknown by the public, even though her cells had been such a vital part of medicine and science for decades.The heartbreaking part about this real-life story is that Henrietta's descendants and family knew nothing about the HeLa cells themselves. They were never given any real explanation about the cells, nor were they compensated in any way. The book brings to light a lot of issues, from social to ethical. Most impressive is the concept that all tissue in and on your body belongs to you while it's attached to you, but as soon as it's removed from you, it's not longer ""yours"". You have no rights over it. It can be researched and sold and re-sold and modified and studies. You get no say in whether you want studies on pieces of your body to go towards the cure for cancer or for the creation of atomic bombs or other devices of mass destruction.Years ago I had a cyst removed. Thinking of a Margaret Atwood story, I asked my surgeon (and every subsequent tech and anesthesiologist whom I met prior to surgery) if I could keep my cyst once they excised it. After their initial responses of ""Ew, WHY?"" they told me that would not, could not, should not ever be available to me. ""But it's MINE"" I tried to argue. They claimed liability, and disease (not that I had a disease, but it's jut not sanitary). None of them had read the Atwood story I was referencing, but if they had, they would have been even more adamant that I should be allowed nowhere near the cyst once it had been removed.I've thought about the same thing during a breast biopsy and then more recently, when they removed my thyroid. What are they going to do with it? What I really would like, more than being able to keep these things that have been pulled from my body over the years, is frequent updates about the road my tissues have traveled. Remember in the 90s the popularity of things like adopting a star, or a whale, or a polar bear. You'd get a picture in the mail for the low-cost of whatever, and then a few updates throughout the year about where your whale is and how it is faring.That's what I want with the tissues that have been taken from me. Just a postcard with a picture of what they're doing with my tissues, a little update that says ""ElPa cell was just sold to Norway for the price of 8 million where they will study the effects of cigarette smoking on this tissue taken from your breast in the early 2000s!""As Skloot spent more time with the Lacks family, she became almost a member of the family herself. After the initial periods of suspicion and caution, Skloot was embraced and was called for all the important family births and deaths and other major life experiences. From a personal storytelling point of view, I found that touching, though it wasn't exactly a necessary part of the main story.I suppose really it means that HeLa (Henrietta Lacks) is a part of everyone, brings us all together. She continues to live, and while her family will never see any portion of the proceeds and still have no say over their mother's cells, there's some satisfaction that can be derived from how common the name Henrietta Lacks is now. The woman behind the cells should never be forgotten. Her contributions (that she didn't even know she was making) should be told. She was more than just the abbreviations HeLa.I know everyone has read this book already by this point, but it came up in my little world because I'm now on the Common Reader Committee at the university where I work. At the first meeting, it became obvious that very few of us are actually readers (one went so far as to say he doesn't like to read, which begs the question as to why he was even there). This book was one of my recommendations, even though I hadn't read it yet. My boss read the first six chapters and felt that it would cover a lot of the bases that our university likes to cover, and would appeal to the three main colleges very well by dealing with social justice issues, science and medicine, legality, ethics, and health and wellness.Now that I've read this book on my own I can go back to our meeting next week and say, holy shit guys, this book really does cover ALL the bases. The idea is this would be a book that everyone could read - every student, staff, and faculty member. While the story meanders a bit and gets a bit dry in other places, I think ultimately the story of Henrietta Lacks and her cells will appeal to all readers in the university.But if I hear one more time from anyone ""But are they mature enough for it"" I will scream. College students aren't quite as dumb as everyone likes to think they are. Maybe they're lazy, but cheese and rice, I'm not going to dumb down the Common Reader in concerns that students won't be able to read a book anymore.Plus there's an HBO movie coming out next month based on this book, so if just reading a book isn't incentive enough, maybe Oprah will be.(My other top contenders would be The Handmaid's Tale and March: Book One. Though some on the committee thinks if we give a graphic novel to college students they will think we're giving them ""cartoons"" to read and there may be an uprising. It's fascinating to me how little faculty and staff know the students at their own university. To be fair, those who suggest an uprising are also the ones who don't read, and they claim not to know how to read a graphic novel. Someone asked ""Do you start at the front or the back?"" conflating graphic novels with manga, I believe. This committee will be a long road for me. Someone just put me in charge already.)"
378,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,5,"It reads like good crime fiction. It chronicles the life of the woman whose cancerous tissue became the first tissue in history which could be successfully grown as culture and used in various, and countless, experiments from vaccine research to cloning. Her tissue was so successful in fact that it became virtually immortal, surviving in various environments and proliferating at prodigious rates. Yet, very little was known about the woman herself, her life, her family, her history, and this is what Skloot set out to uncover. What she found out is absolutely stunning from the point of medical ethics, American history and American healthcare. Fascinating. Highly recommended."

I knew a little bit about Henrietta Lacks, but I was definitely not aware of the extent to which her family was affected by the use of her sells in modern day biology. It broke my heart to see how her family, deeply rooted in religious beliefs, was broken because they felt as though Henrietta's soul resided in those cells. I have my own personal opinions about the entire concept of doctors taking medical waste for their own advantages. Nevertheless, what I can say about this issue is that it is stories such as the Tuskegee Experiment and the use of Henrietta's cells that have ultimately made the black community hesitant about wanting to go to doctors. I plan to do more research on this topic and it may be a project that I throw myself into. Hopefully I can find more text that really delves into the black community's experience with the medical field. This really opened my eyes to a lot of issues related to the medical field/industry and I can't wait to read more. "

She told me about this book over Christmas. I can see why it’s required reading. I’m glad it is and I hope it is for medical and research students everywhere.It tells the story of an African American woman, Henrietta Lacks, who went to Johns Hopkins in 1951 for treatment for cervical cancer. Some cancerous cells were removed from her body. This much she knew. The cells were also saved, cultured, and reproduced—without her knowledge or consent—as was common practice at the time. What makes this an amazing story is that Henrietta’s cells have never died from that day until the present, hence the title. They continue to grow and reproduce at a phenomenal rate. They currently exist in laboratories, hospitals and warehouses all over the world; have been used in almost every form of scientific research from the 50’s until now; have gone to space; have been contaminated and caused contamination. The scientific and medical communities owe untold debt to the cells it calls HeLa and yet not one dime of compensation, even in terms of discounted medical care or health insurance has ever been received by any of Henrietta’s numerous descendants. Interestingly enough, they aren’t looking for anything in that way. Now isn’t that refreshing? Rather, in spite of all they have suffered—and indeed this is a book about pain—their focal interest throughout was in finding out what happened to their mother since she died so young, gaining recognition for her and learning what happened to Henrietta’s oldest daughter who died in a ‘hospital for the negro insane’, which was 1950’s terminology.  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks crosses many disciplines and for that reason I expect scientists might skim the vignettes about Henrietta’s children, while those who prefer human interest could find themselves avoiding the technical sections. Virginia Woolf’s Common Readers, however, will positively adore this book! It has everything they look for in the written word. Not only what was just mentioned, but also: the complexities and importance of the ‘tissue issue’, what are the medical, legal, ethical, and other parameters for tissue gathering, storage, research, usage, and compensation. And I commend the author, Rebecca Skloot, a self-proclaimed non-believer for her sensitive handling of the many stressed and stressful events, issues and personalities she encountered concerning matters of faith, morals, and religion.  A very important book to read!  Here is a rather long but fascinating 1998 BBC documentary about Henrietta Lacks and HeLa.  Here is an article which gives some more current info about the Lacks family and the issue of privacy v. tissue donation. "
383,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"Henrietta Lacks, a young African-American mother of five children, died in Baltimore in 1951 from a highly aggressive form of cervical cancer—but more than fifty years after her death, part of her lives on in the form of HeLa, a cell line cultivated from a tissue sample of hers which played a key role in several major scientific and medical breakthroughs. Skloot's book tells Lacks' story, partly to pay tribute to a woman who was forgotten by all but her family for many years despite her importance to medicine; partly in order to examine the complex attendant issues of medical ethics, race and class. Skloot's writing is fluid and accessible, and I learned some things which were shocking though not surprising to me (see the organ retention scandal which broke in Ireland a few years ago). That said, I would have liked for a stronger focus on the ethics and the science aspect of the novel and less on the lives of Lacks' children and other relatives. Skloot's focus on them and on some of the more unpalatable aspects of their lives felt quite voyeuristic to me at points, recounted not because Skloot wanted to examine the effects of the vicious cycle of poverty on people's lives but because it would inject more drama into the book. The author talks at length about the less-than-pure motivations of those who had previously profited from Lacks' cells, and their refusal to compensate Lacks' family in any way, about how she was financing her research with credit cards and student loans—and yet her end-goal was always to acquire a book deal, and her account of her relentless attempts to get in touch with members of the Lacks family made me highly uncomfortable. Much of the latter half of the book dealt with the relationship between Skloot and Deborah, Henrietta Lacks' youngest daughter—again, uncomfortable to read about at several points, and not especially relevant to the book's main thrust. Overall, an interesting read, but I feel that The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks could easily have been edited down to half its length—and focused more on Henrietta because of it."

The weft is the story of a friendship between two women meeting each other on the edge of both their worlds, brought there by Henrietta: her immortality is not simply a series of cells.the narrators are excellent. the pacing is a tiny bit slow, but that works for the direct quotes - and hearing voices in dialect anchors the story in time and place.

I tell you the premise, and that's the book. It just keeps doubling over itself to tell you the same science, the same sad story of the people it affected, and nothing ever really happens. People say things like ""hold on, are you ready for this?"" and then nothing happens. It's the same information over and over. So I'm going to spoil the whole book for you; Henrietta Lacks was a poor syphilitic black woman who married her cousin, had a bunch of kids, and died very young of an aggressive cancer, the cells of which doctors took samples of without asking and then developed into the first 'immortal' cell line, which went on to be used by scientist and doctors around the world. Her descendants are plagued by poverty and bad health. That's it. Now imagine me telling you different versions of that over and over while I also tell you about how I'm researching and writing about it, dealing with this difficult and suspicious relatives.

And i think that especially that is something that should be taking away from this book: This story is important and interesting, but so far not much has changed in the medical field so that this type of thing does not continues to happen without permission from the patients themselves. This book does point out quiet a lot of positive things that happened because and with cells and how it could have never happened without them. Some horrendous things, some wonderful things where achieved thanks to those cells and with that thanks to Henrietta Lacks. And i am defiantly one of the first people to point out that medical advances are necessary and that we still have way to little knowledge and actual solutions for way to man illnesses! But i think that this book also points out two very important things and drives them home quiet nicely: 1. Human tissue was once part of a person!We all should respect that. Yes its important that a lot of different science fields have access to tissue samples. But its also important to remember the people that gave those samples. Be it willingly, unwillingly, during life or after their death, it was once part of a living breathing person! I think a lot of us prefer to ignore that, or try to forget it and i think that is defiantly one thing we all should work on always remembering when we take any kind of medicine without a second thought! 2. there are lot of loopholes legally that should be worked on!All this talk of ""technically it wasn't required"" in this book just made me want to shake someone! What it comes down to in very basic forms -especially in regards of this specific book and the story it tells- is that everyone should be asking for permission. Doctors and scientists should explain in understandable terms what they want and why it could be helpful and i am pretty sure that a lot of people -especially those with illnesses!- will be more than willing to hand out tissue samples for further use! No need to just take them without asking! So why do it?Which brings it all back to the first point: lets not forget all those ""samples"" actually come from someone that is not just there to be a lab-rat!Now the one ""negative"" thing of this book is that i personally didn't really like how the Skloot wrote this book. Some sections felt as if she wanted to get that particular part of the story told and done with as fast as possible and shoved a lot of details and information into a pretty small section and number of pages. And than sometimes she would go on and on about some things for endless number of pages that i personally felt that it wasn't necessary to go on about it for that long. To say it short it is not he best nonfiction writing i have read. BUT its also far from the worst. Its very readable and yes it could have been kept a little shorter, but all in all it was done pretty well in the writing department. of course that is completely personal and some of the reviews i read LOVED the writing, so clearly that part is debatable.If you are interested in this book, defiantly give it a try. If you are going into a scientific field? Defiantly read this!"
389,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,"A book like this makes me realize how important education in general and particularly science education is. Today’s science is yesterday’s magic—for those who don’t understand science, it can seem like very frightening black magic. The story of Henrietta Lacks explores the intersection between science, research, education, capitalism, civil rights, and consent.The major question implicit in this book is whether we have any claim to our own cells after they have been removed from our bodies. Is it ethical to take “discarded” cells—those left over after medical procedures—and do research from them and potentially make money from either the cells or the research. This issue gets us down somewhere in our irrational subconscious—after all, we all “know” enough about voodoo and black magic to know that curses require hair, nail clippings, blood, or other bodily secretions in order to be effective. In many ways, the story of the HeLa cell line traces the history of medical research in the US (and to some extent, other countries), evolving from the exploitation of vulnerable people towards the concept of informed consent. It also traces the history of an African American family, liberated from slavery, but not from poverty and deprivation. The current distrust of science has some real roots in situations like these, where people were used without their knowledge for experimental purposes. But the lack of scientific literacy in the general population helps with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and the prevalence of medical quackery. Witness all the “miracle cures” that people buy into. One older lady that I used to work with was always pouring money into some miracle weight loss scheme or another—it didn’t seem to occur to her that if the method actually worked, it would be front page news on Time magazine, not some obscure ad in the back of a newspaper.We have to seriously question ourselves and our politicians about the quality of our educational systems. Are they being funded? Do we have enough teachers? Can poor children hope to get education equal to that of rich children?As my grandfather used to say, no education is wasted."
390,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"For a non-fiction book about science, this book is pretty interesting. Chapters about genes, cloning and cancer are juxtaposed with chapters about Henrietta's personal life and about the author's interactions with the Lacks family. I think this book would scare a lot of people about how privacy is dealt with as a legal issue in the medical community. The book is about Henrietta Lacks - a woman whose cells live on and on to be experimented with, cloned, put into space, blown up, used to make human-animal and human-plant hybrids, etc. The point of the book is that these cells were taken from her without her knowledge or consent. Today, no one in her family can afford medical care, even though their mother/grandmother's cells are stored by the billions in laboratories around the world. This brings up many interesting points in debates about what rights the medical community has to do procedures 'for the benefit of humankind' vs. the rights of the individual and patient. Do your cells and tissues belong to you? Do they still belong to you, even when removed from your body? It is surprising how fuzzy the laws still are on this issue. The book also touches a little bit on racism - Henrietta was black, and the doctors who took and distributed her cells were white. But racism isn't the main focus. I found this book fascinating - and cell research isn't really my forte. I recommend this book, even to people who generally don't read or like non-fiction."
391,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,5,I read this book back in 2013 just before I joined Goodreads. I found my review on Audible and decided to add it to Goodreads for my records.This is a well written non-fiction book that provides back ground information about unfair treatment of minorities by medical research. Cassandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin did a great job with the narration of the book. The story of Henrietta Lacks and her family is interesting and the discovery and care of the Hi La cells. One major item about the family is the lack of education that played a major role in their understanding and ability to control the situation. The book accomplishes its goal of promoting proper documentation of biological tissue research. It raises the question of ownership of our own tissues and whether or not we have proprietary rights to our bodies in situ or in vitro. This question needs to be answered NOW not in the future. The other teaching of the book was how important education is to each individual. This is an absolute must read book for everyone on this planet. 
392,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,3,"This was definitely much more than just your average popular science book. Never have a I read a non-fiction book that is so multi-faceted - science, superstition, ethics, family troubles, violence, estrangement, racism - what a cocktail! Full review soon."
393,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5447027-ayelet-waldman,5,Holy shit this book is awesome.
394,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"I blew through this fascinating audiobook, practically manufacturing housework to do so that I'd have an excuse to plug myself in (okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration; there was plenty of housework to do without my having to manufacture any). I would recommend this book to just about anyone seeking a great read -- even if you're usually more of a fiction person, this non-fiction book offers plenty of interesting characters and storylines as well as being informative and provocative in the way of non-fiction.Did you know that much of medical research (and the benefits we derive every day, including many routine vaccines and medications we take for granted) is dependent on a culture of human cells that continue to live and reproduce even after their original owner died in 1951? Well, I didn't. And I wouldn't have thought that this factoid would interest me particularly, not being much of a science person myself. But somehow, Rebecca Skloot was able to make the dynamics surrounding these cells not only comprehensible to me but intriguing (no small feat). Even more intriguing, though, was the story of the late human being behind these cells, Henrietta Lacks, who never knew that her cells had been taken for research. Henrietta's surviving children, tragically losing their mother at a young age to cervical cancer and raised in a poor and abusive environment, only learned about this later in life and never saw a penny of the proceeds.""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" contains several stories. There is the story of Henrietta, a poor young African American woman with incurable cervical cancer, and of her children struggling to grow up without her after her early death. There is the story of the doctor who decided to slice off pieces of her tumor just prior to her death without asking or even informing her, who then discovered that these cancerous cells were immortal. There is the story of the cells, which began to be mass-produced and distributed to researchers for a wide variety of interesting and often ground-breaking experiments. And there is the story of Rebecca Skloot, a journalist who was persistent and dogged in her efforts to win Henrietta's family's reluctant trust (after they had been duped by others attempting to capitalize on Henrietta) so that she could learn and tell their story.Henrietta's adult children in this book are colorful characters with their own stories who overcame some difficult situations, some more successfully than others. We also meet different doctors and researchers -- while some prove to be profiteers, others are truly dedicated to science for its own sake. The doctor who originally took Henrietta's tumor for research without her knowledge fell into the latter category, which is part of what makes this a three-dimensional book rather than a simplistic polemic. A product of his times, this 1950s doctor was less sensitive to the medical and research ethics which have since received more attention, particularly when it came to a poor African-American woman. Should you care if someone uses your body tissues for medical research without your consent? Before I began reading this book, my thought was, why the heck would I care? Assuming that these tissues need to be removed in any case, why not use them to do some good for science and for mankind? But Rebecca offers some anecdotes which complicate this question, and the irony running throughout the book is that Henrietta's descendants cannot afford decent medical care, even as the entire medical profession benefits from Henrietta's unwittingly donated cells.Even if you think you're not a science person, even if you think you're not a non-fiction person, I would recommend checking this book out."
395,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"On the threshold between medicine and ethics.This book talks about ethical and legal conflicts, historically raised by the discovery of immortal cells that changed medicine and patients life's for the better. It‘s an astonishing story you probably didn‘t hear about before:In 1951 a colored poor woman named Henrietta Lacks walked into the Hopkins University, where a doctor extracted cells from her large cervix tumor, that killed her briefly after. But as they discovered in the laboratory, those were anything but normal cells, but the first immortal human cells grown in culture. They are still alive today and were replicated to millions and spread to laboratories all over the world, though Lacks has been dead for more than sixty years. They called them HeLa cells and they were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. What interested me the most was the scientific and legal part of that book. Ultimately it‘s a question of property and if we have the right on our cells, once they leave our body, particularly if we don‘t know about it.First there is the problem with uninformed consent. Henrietta did not provide informed consent for her cells to be used, she didn‘t have knowledge. Beyond that people were later unknowingly injected with her tumor cells, for the purpose of medical research. The same was performed on healthy prisoners with their knowledge, though their free consent seems to be questionable. They developed tumors, sometimes killing them. Furthermore her autopsy report was later published in the book of a journalist, the family didn‘t knew about and didn‘t want to see published. The question is the violation of privacy rights.The second problem are genetic rights/non-rights. Her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later, and didn‘t fully approve of it‘s usage A big focus also are patents and profits for biologic material.Henrietta and her family were very poor and didn’t even have health insurance. They received zero profits, while her cells sell for multiple-millions until today.Very shocking are also racism claims. Because the cells were discovered in the 50, making public that white people were treated with cell stems of a black woman would have had a major impact. Additionally implications are made, that colored people were categorically abused, abducted, purposely infected and killed to perform medical experiments. The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications, but actual, valuable people and historic events.What I didn’t like just as much though, is how the story is told at times, jumping between characters and writing styles; sometimes loosing the silver lining. The writing is very simple and doesn’t at all feel factual. As a non fiction fan, I miss that at times but I guess that others appreciate it even more. It reads a lot like a novel, particularly since a lot of content is told through conversations. In conclusion a super interesting story I won’t forget quickly!"
396,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna,5,"What a wonderful book! It describes the life of Henrietta Lacks and her family, the origin of the HeLa cell line (the first human immortal cell line), the research conducted with these cells, and also the author’s research and interviews in unfolding this story.“I’ve tried to imagine how she’d feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. I’m pretty sure that she—like most of us—would be shocked to hear that there are trillions more of her cells growing in laboratories now than there ever were in her body.” "
397,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1295401-diane-chamberlain,5,"Can't wait to recommend this book to my bookclub. It will make for a fabulous discussion. This book can satisfy several audiences on several different levels. The technical information about the science of cells is fascinating. The ethical questions raised by the unauthorized use of someone's cells are important to ask and ponder. But most fascinating is the story of the Lacks family. Skloot's exhaustive research spanned a decade and she tells a story that is honest, heart wrenching and provocative. "
398,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl,5,"This is one stellar piece of nonfiction that has a bit of everything in it for everybody. Beautifully written and structured because it is clear that while there's SOoo much information here, it is arranged in such a way that you don't get lost. Sure the author is a science writer, but she's also a creative nonfiction writer so the book doesn't read like a nonfiction textbook, and has the plot structure of fiction. Some chapters tell the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family, others take you on the research journey with Rebecca Skloot. The interactions she has with the family makes for light, sometimes humorous reading. In fact, the chronology is done in a way to make the book more interesting. The book is as much about family, as it is about science, history, racial tensions, and of one extraordinary black woman who has done more for medical research and advancements, than anything or anyone the industry has seen. It will have you crying, laughing, yelling at people...you name it. Born in 1920, Henrietta Lacks was thirty years old when she went to see a doctor for ""spotting"" and pain, and started getting treatments for cervical cancer (mind you, in the ""colored"" wards of John Hopkins. This was during the Jim Crow era). The researcher/doctor who treated her, collected samples of her cells (without her knowledge) while he placed radium inside of her. She soon deteriorated and each time she went in for treatment, her cells were taken and stored. Yet she knew nothing of the cells growing in a lab, or the fact that she was now infertile because of her cancer treatment. When she died, her husband signed paperwork to have an autopsy performed, because he was under the impression that doctors would find out if his children were predisposed to whatever his wife had, not knowing that his signature allowed his wife's body to be cut open to help with more research.This is the breadth of the story I think. A story about an African-American woman whose life and death seemed to be an irony--she wasn't allowed to mention her white, slave-owning family, yet she was buried next to them. She wasn't allowed to use the ""white-only"" medical facilities, yet her cells were mixed with white cells. In science cell culture, there were no other cells with the ability to multiply and stay immortal like hers. So every major medical breakthrough, like polio vaccine for example, came from the usage of her cells. The main thrust is, she didn't know. Her family didn't know, and they didn't find out until twenty years later because the name Henrietta Lacks was hidden by the doctors who used her cells as research. Scientists made millions from her body and her family had tons of health issues, with no help from their mother's cells and no health insurance. ""A search of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database turns up more than seventeen thousand patents involving HeLa Cells,"" Skloot wrote. But Henrietta's son Lawrence wanted to know, ""She's the most important woman in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""There they were, at a time when the country was learning about the ""Tuskegee Syphilis Study"" (where African-American men with syphilis were recruited for research, then made to die slow, painful deaths even after their researchers realized that penicillin would cure them), and cells from a black woman was being used to save millions of Americans, mostly white.In this book, Skloot brings the woman behind the cells to life, talks about her life, her troubled marriage, her children. She develops a relationship with Deborah, Henrietta's daughter who suffered the most from all of it. She talks to scientists and researchers. She brings in history. She talks about race tensions and shows how when slavery was abolished, African-Americans became slaves to another master: medicine. I'll admit, at times it was an emotional roller coaster for me, but one quote from Deborah stood out for me and should for you:""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different.""So anybody should be able to read this book because the way in which it is written, is not to point fingers (not even at the medical industry because the author manages to explain those times as well) but to glean the truth. To finally give credit where credit is due, and to educate. To honor a woman, a mother, a wife, whose body makes it possible for us to get some of the modern medical treatments that we get today. This is one book I will remember, that's for sure! "
399,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon,4,"In 1951, Henrietta Lacks passed away due to complications arising from cervical cancer. Following her death, cancerous cells were harvested from her body and used in ongoing experiments regarding the growth of cells outside the human body. Previous to Henrietta, scientists could only make it a few days before the cells would ultimately die, forcing them to start all over. Henrietta’s cells were different, they grew at an astounding rate and researchers were able to keep them alive. Since the discovery, they've been used in countless experiments and led to numerous scientific breakthroughs - most notably the polio vaccine.Today, Henrietta’s cells usually go for a few hundred dollars a vial but her descendants live in poverty. While many of her children believe they should be compensated for the sale of HeLa cells, court cases involving similar claims have always found in favor of research companies rather than individuals - the argument being that once a procedure is performed and tissue is removed from a body, it is no longer of use to the individual and the hospital can do with it as it pleases, be it incineration or study. On one hand, it makes sense given that it was highly doubtful Henrietta’s husband could have opened a cellular research facility, however, the problem lies within the fact that researchers did not tell Henrietta’s family about the importance of HeLa cells and lied to her children when additional bloodwork was requested for further study.The story of the Lacks family is a heartbreaking one. Henrietta had a terrible upbringing and following her death, things became that much worse for her children. While the book mainly concentrates on the HeLa cells, there’s a shocking piece on her daughter Elsie, who had been diagnosed with “idiocy” and institutionalized at Crownsville Hospital Centre (a.k.a. The Hospital for the Negro Insane) following her mother’s death. The conditions at the time of Elsie’s arrival were deplorable. They had a total of eight attendants (four in the day, four in the evening) for five hundred and sixty patients. One ward in particular had seventy eight patients with only twenty eight beds. There were also only three toilets to share amongst them all. You can imagine how much this upset the family when they found out decades later.While The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks can be deeply upsetting, it is without a doubt an important book. Author Rebecca Skloot spent years interviewing the Lacks family (which at times was certainly no easy task) and researching Henrietta’s life and death, all information that had been buried over time. The story flows well and her afterword provides greater insight into the legal ramifications of future soft tissue research. Henrietta’s youngest daughter Deborah always wanted the world to know about the person behind the HeLa cells, the real human being who provided the ammunition for several medical discoveries. Thanks to Rebecca’s tireless work, Henrietta Lacks' incredible true story is out there for the world to see.Also posted @ Every Read Thing."

Some people comment on the human interest aspect of the story with regard to the Lacks family. Other people mention the cell science. For me, the most interesting thing was the history of informed consent, or the ""Lacks"" thereof. (Go ahead and laugh now at my clever wordplay. You know you want to.)It's hard to believe the bizarre ways people's bodies were used for medical research, with or without their consent. Even when they did give consent, they did so without being told exactly what would be done to their bodies. Too often the people used for the studies were the poor, the uneducated, and prison inmates. Back in the forties and fifties, ""Many scientists believed that since patients were treated for free in the public wards, it was fair to use them as research subjects as a form of payment."" YIKES! That's not just unethical, it's abominable.Rebecca Skloot's dedication to the research and writing of this story is remarkable. She spent pretty much the entire decade of her twenties in pursuit of the truth about Henrietta Lacks and her ""immortal"" cells. My only reason for not awarding the full five stars is that I thought the book could have used one more ruthless edit before final printing. "

Clearly, a result of hard work and intense research and, above all the fact that the author has taken student loans and used her credit cards for the research work and had no other backing or support.

406,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66292681-sarah-lumos,4,"  “Henrietta’s (cells) were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.”  Argh, I feel embarrassed admitting this, but before reading this book, I had no idea what the HeLa cells were. I never studied science in-depth, which is now one of my biggest regrets. However, I guess in some ways I was lucky: I got to know who Henrietta Lacks was before meeting her famous cells. In this well-researched biography, Rebecca Skloot tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, a poor Black woman who was only 31 when she died from cervical cancer. While she was getting treatments at John Hopkins Hospital, Dr. George Guy took cells from Lack’s tumor without her consent. After examining her cells, Guy felt amazed. He realized her cells were unlike any he had seen - Henrietta’s cells refused to die.HeLa would become the first immortal cell line grown in a lab. For scientists, this discovery was monumental. It would allow them to conduct experiments they never could before. Henrietta’s cells would later help create in vitro fertilization, polio vaccines, and cancer treatments. Although HeLa cells have affected each of us in different ways, before this book’s publication, most of us had little to no idea who Henrietta Lacks was.Here is what I found riveting: Henrietta never graduated from high school, yet she became one of the most important people in science. Sure, science has its own explanation for how this happened, but her family believed God chose Henrietta. God wanted her to come back to Earth in the form of her cells to help others. Since the Lacks had a weak science background, faith was their way of understanding what happened to Henrietta, and making sense of the non-sensical. Though most of the Lacks were happy Henrietta’s cells were advancing science, some of them were mad. The Lacks had no science education, and scientists never bothered to explain to them what happened to Henrietta in a simple way. Researchers exploited their ignorance and the Lacks were never able to give informed consent. Their frustrations are understandable. I felt like giving each of them a hug when I read these passages. If I were them, I would be upset too. While HeLa cells were becoming a multi-million dollar industry, the Lacks were living in poverty, barely able to afford health insurance:   “...the last thing he remembered before falling into unconsciousness under anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened to medicine. Sonny woke up more than $125,000 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery.”  I also admire Skloot's grit because this was a massive project to undertake. I can understand why this book took her a decade to write. I think she wanted to do Henrietta's story justice, and she did. Skloot made sure the world knew about the Lacks and what they did for science. Furthermore, I liked that Skloot’s discussed the social determinants of health. Her clear prose helped me better understand patient rights, inequalities in medicine, informed consent, and tissue ownership laws. Overall, “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" was a magnificent treat. I am positive other readers will find this book as informative and awe-inspiring as I did."
407,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Skloot delivers a mix of science history and human interest in her journalistic style. She discusses medical ethics particularly the issue of informed consent as she tells the story of Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta was a poor black woman who joined the great migration of the 1940’s moving from rural southern Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. She was treated for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins, the only nearby hospital that would admit blacks in 1951. After suffering through the then standard radium therapy, she died that same year. Samples of her tumor were removed and became the first successful human cell culture to sustain itself. Known as HeLa her cells live on today in labs around the world the subject of endless experimentation. Most of the book is spent on Henrietta’s life, her daughter Deborah, their families and extended relations as well as the author’s work with the family to research the book. We follow Henrietta from her childhood in the 1920’s growing up in former slave quarters on the wrong side of the tracks in the small tobacco country town of Clover, Virginia. Skloot gives a somewhat romanticized version of what must have been a harsh life of poverty and discrimination. Similarly Skloot tries to bring out the positives while dutifully reporting the difficult lives of Henrietta’s descendants who suffer from chronic mental and physical illnesses, limited education and continued discrimination in the Baltimore area. Particularly interesting to me was the communication gap between the scientists and Henrietta’s working class African American family. A big part of the problem was the history of exploitation of African Americans by white doctors and their medical institutions. This history had been internalized into a pervasive distrust of doctors and hospitals by Henrietta’s family. Henrietta’s and her family’s fear is understandable and it struck me as part of a broader issue. With unarmed black men dying regularly at the hands of the police, we see similar fears by African Americans today. Skloot points out that scientific progress was made from practices that now would be clearly unethical. Henrietta’s cells sped up the development of the Polio vaccine in the early 1950’s saving many from this devastating disease. Concepts such as informed consent did not exist in 1951. Even today the issue is very murky which the author addresses in her afterword. At the end of the book Skloot returns to Clover to find it gone. All the ramshackle old buildings torn down, just empty fields remaining. Most of those who knew Henrietta had now passed on too. Only her cells remain, thriving in labs everywhere and generating the ground breaking medical discoveries of a new era. "

Except that it is not possible to extract a story from a writer's imagination without their consent. Henrietta Lacks was a young mother in her early thirties when she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer that would quickly take her life. She was fortunate to live close to the John Hopkins hospital, set up to ensure equal access to medical care for all' no matter their race, status, income or any other characteristic that might have otherwise given cause to discriminate.Before undergoing treatment, one of the Doctors took a tissue sample of her healthy cells and the cancerous cells, as he had been doing to most patients, in an effort to try and find cells that would continue to replicate without dying - the elusive ""immortal"" cell. It had never been done successfully with human cells before.He succeeded and the cells became known the world over as he gave them away freely, known as HeLa cells, the immortal human cells that never died and could be used over and over again to test for cures to disease and to observe how cells react to numerous variables, furthering science in ways unimaginable previously. Few paused to ask who the woman behind these cells was, what was her story, how did her family feel about this multi million dollar research industry that was making great strides in science yes, and also making entrepreneurial types wealthy in the process.Rebecca Skloot made Henrietta the subject of her research for 10 years in the creation of this thorough, respectful account of the life of Henrietta Lacks and her journey to uncover the events of the time within the context of what was the norm in her day. In much of it she is accompanied by Henriettas daughter Deborah, a passionate woman who was unable to find peace in her own life, until she had helped bring her mother's story to light.A brilliant and informative story and piece of scientific medical history that reads like a novel and brings our awareness to the many who unknowingly make sacrifices for the better of others and that always present aspect of those hovering in the wings, recognising an opportunity to profit."

The votes have been in for years: author Rebecca Skloot’s book racked up 19 significant awards and citations in 2010 when it was first published. The 2011 trade paperback edition I read boasts five pages of exuberant blurbs before you even get to the title page. I wanted to be a curmudgeon about it, but the story is so serious that I had to relinquish my pissy attitude. It is just that type of story: a sensational true crime story with ramifications in the fields of health and science; race and sociology; ethics, history, and journalism. Suspenseful, cinematic, and factual, Ms. Skloot manages to pack it all inside of 310 pages, with 71 pages remaining for appendices, acknowledgements, notes, and discussion group questions! She writes knowledgeably, intelligently, compassionately, and skillfully. This book is all that! The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family. It is about the miraculous and immortal cells---taken from her cervix without her permission in 1951 and how they have been serving medical research ever since. It is a story about her daughter, Deborah, and a science journalist (Rebecca Skloot) dedicating years of her life to questioning, investigating, researching, and writing. It is about injustice and justice; human liberties, and privileging science over human life and the right to make informed decisions. This book chillingly illustrates the complex path of ethics and medical research in the United States from the 1950s to the present. It made me mad, but it also educated me in a profound way."

In fact this is the first book to keep me so intellectually and emotionally engaged in a very long time. I struggle to find the words to express what it meant to read about the plight of this woman and the medical knowledge gained from her cells. To read this book is to begin to understand the impact of these cells on modern medicine. Then the book takes you further to read about what has happened to her family during these medical breakthroughs, the impact of what happened and its influences on the laws and the practice of medicine. Just an amazing book with so many elements intertwined and presented with such empathy and beauty. As a brief aside, shortly after I finished the book I had a minor medical procedure performed. Before they would begin, the patient must sign a medical release form and on the form was a statement asking the patient to relinquish all rights of ownership to any tissue samples removed. After reading this book I understand the implications (signed it, but was much more aware of the rationale behind it). This was a life affecting book for me. I didn't close the book thinking that I knew the answers to the ethical questions it raised. What I did feel was that it just seemed some how unjust that her family fared so poorly when her cells were so vital to so many of the scientific advancements made after her death. It presented legal and ethical quandaries that some of the finest legal minds still haven't wrapped their minds around. Engaging and enlightening book? And how!! Highly recommended!!!"

As someone who is strongly considering donating my body to science when I die, this was a probative read to think about the changing ethics of medicine, and a reminder that so much scientific development has been done on unwilling, non-consenting, and uninformed individuals. Top among these unwitting contributors, must rank Henrietta Lacks, whose indomitable cancer cells have led to inestimable developments. Though the ethics have tissue collection has drastically changed since the 1950s, it is surprising how much of a wild, wild west this area remains.

“Everybody in the world got her cells, only thing we got of our mother is just them medical records and her Bible.”
In 1951 doctors at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore diagnosed an unusually extreme case of cervical cancer. The breakneck growth rate and resistance to common remedies were unlike anything previously seen. Without informed consent, the doctor scraped a clump of cells from the cancerous tumor during one of the 30 year-old woman’s visits and deposited them with a nearby cell culture lab operated by George Gey. There, in the air-controlled space of Gey’s facility, something happened that researchers had long suspected out of reach. Where countless other cells before them had died, hers survived, and multiplied indefinitely. The immortality of this one cell line would prove instrumental in treating a number of the world’s most heavy-hitting diseases and set the stage for an all new era in cell research, medical diagnosis, drug development and bioethics. But this is a story not just about bundles of cells, but about the humanity behind them, and in particular the family to which they will forever be tied.That woman was Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta passed away just nine months after diagnosis, but it would be more than two decades before her family received word of the namesake cell line which survived her—HeLa. Its value as a scientific and commercial commodity was paramount, getting bogged down in the thicket of rights and privacy less so. Once researchers discovered that Henrietta’s cells did not die but instead bred a new generation every twenty-four hours, HeLa quickly became the tireless workhorse of the culture community. Vials were trucked to research facilities around the world, where they were regularly exposed to a pavilion of infectious diseases, merged with non-human DNA, and even shot into space in an effort to study the influence of zero gravity.Over time, details about the parent of the eponymous cells funneled out of view. Henrietta’s own kin were oblivious to the fact that her cells lived, were being studied and tested in dozens of countries, and were being exchanged at great profit. Once the unwitting donor’s official name was released, journalists descended in full fervor, leading to a lifetime of turmoil and unrest for the Lacks household. Set against the rich legacy of the family’s cells, their life of poverty and unpaid medical bills seemed untoward by comparison, and this sense of injustice only mounted as more details filtered in from the press.Rebecca Skloot’s segue into this lush narrative was by and large a product of serendipitous circumstance, having first heard of HeLa in an intro to biology course at her local community college. After learning that these cells had lived outside their host's body for the better part of a century, and about the remarkable advances they have gifted to science, Skloot shot up her hand and innocently asked, ""Who was she?"" The professor's reply proved unsatisfying: ""An African American woman."" The seed of curiosity had been planted. By the time Skloot graduated she'd decided to write a book to recover the disremembered woman whose cells had won so many victories for science and society.Who Was Henrietta Lacks?For more than a decade, Skloot layered herself into the Lacks’ story, befriending and forming deep bonds with Henrietta’s children and cousinry. She forges an especially strong connection with Deborah Lacks, Henrietta’s youngest daughter, who was unfortunately too young to remember much about her mother. With a mix of patience and persistence the two work together to dig up Henrietta’s heritage and bring to light her hitherto uncelebrated legacy. It is Skloot’s at times unstable relationship and camaraderie with Deborah that gives the narrative its steam, as the two probe ever deeper into the mystery surrounding her mother.Tracing the family’s roots places Henrietta’s childhood at the tail end of the Jim Crow era, a time when segregation meant a great deal more than which bathroom and water fountain one was required to use. Rampant legal disadvantages in the South bred systemic, institutionalized maladjustment for blacks, and this included limited access to medical care. Having spent her youth on a slave plantation in Clover, Virginia, Henrietta joined in the Great Migration at the ripened age of twenty-one, exchanging her familiarity with tobacco fields for a new life in Baltimore. Nine years later, she would be diagnosed with the malignancy that led to her iconic cell line. And it would be another fifty years before Deborah, with the help of Skloot, laid eyes on her mother’s original medical records.Johns Hopkins Hospital was founded for the express purpose of treating Baltimore's poor and, unlike today, informed consent upon providing blood or tissue samples was neither required by law nor common practice (the term did not even appear in a court document until 1957). Like everyone at the time, Henrietta hadn't a clue about what would become of her excised genetic material and the boons it would lavish upon the scientific community. This became a flashpoint issue in the years that followed as the occasional patient attempted to turn a gray area into a lucrative venture. While we learned more about DNA and transmissible disease, Henrietta's resilient cells inaugurated an international conversation on the commercialization of biological materials and where exactly the donors fit within that ecosystem. In many ways, the conversation is ongoing. (Skloot includes a superb summary in the afterword which draws together the various threads of this nuanced debate.) The HeLa LegacyTo properly gauge the vastitude of the legacy tied up in Henrietta’s cells, it’s important to understand 20th century cell culture. Until Henrietta came along, cell immortality was a pipe dream. While standard, non-cancerous cells had been grown in vitro since 1907, none of them survived long enough to endure important testing, petering out after 50 divisions, on average. Even cancer cells, like those common to cervical cancers, died shortly after relocation to the culture environment. This meant not only was there a brief window for experimentation but that a continuous supply of fresh cells was needed to sustain research. Many in the field yearned for a better way.HeLa keynoted a paradigm shift. They were robust enough to survive in the bricolage of materials used in Dr. Gey’s culture medium, and they were susceptible to the same range of infectious diseases as were normal cells. This allowed researchers to inject the lively DNA with diseases as well as cures. Not merely a boon to science, this revolutionized the field, so much so that one of the researchers Skloot interviews in the book, when asked what would happen if HeLa was pulled from research use, replied, “Restricting HeLa cell use would be disastrous. The impact that would have on science is inconceivable.” (p. 328)Thanks to Dr. Gey’s partnering efforts with labs around the globe, the benefits of HeLa manifested seemingly overnight. In just one year after HeLa’s genesis, Jonas Salk and his team were able to derive a vaccine for polio by infecting HeLa cells, followed shortly by drug treatments for HPV, herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia and Parkinson’s disease. In 1953 HeLa became the first cells to be cloned successfully. In total, some 60,000 papers have been published on HeLa, and cell culturists still use her cancer cells as a model for human biology.What was it exactly that gave HeLa cells their added dose of moxie? Even today, we can only speculate. We now know that Henrietta was infected with both HPV and syphilis, so one theory is that this virulent combination may have helped suppress PCD. A rival theory suggests she had highly atypical genes to begin with, perhaps a rare mutation, that enabled the cancer to spiral in unspecified directions. We still are uncertain. HeLa has also been the source of much frustration over the years from regularly contaminating other cell lines, often halting research until the botch-up is sorted.Closing ThoughtsRebecca Skloot’s ten-year effort is a literary and cultural marvel balanced between unsheathing the posthumous success and humanity behind one of the richest narratives in science and laying bare the bioethical implications to which it is attached. It succeeds on both fronts. Skloot is at her most animating when channeling the lens of Deborah Lacks as they band together to reach some much-needed closure to the saga thrust upon the Lacks family. With her first book, Skloot has demonstrated in equal measure her facility for conveying scientific nuance while weaving meaning and poetic force into a cohesive whole. Yes, this is first and foremost a work of nonfiction, but its pages are emblazoned with enough touches of novel-like charisma to beckon both crowds. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a timeless story delivered by a gifted writer and the definitive presentation of the legacy Henrietta never lived to see. Highly recommended.Skloot also founded The Henrietta Lacks Foundation - click here for more - to provide support for the Lacks as well as assistance to African Americans pursuing education in science and medicine. A portion of her book’s proceeds are donated to the Foundation.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."
415,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7983564-kaora,4,"A really powerful read about HeLa cells, taken without consent from a woman named Henrietta Lacks. Her cells contributed to many of modern medicines discoveries, including the polio vaccine and gene mapping, and yet her family is still so poor they cannot afford health care hacing seen none of the money generated by these cells.This book explores the debate about what makes up a person's body. Is a shed skin cell the property of the person whose DNA is within the cell, or have they given up their ownership? And what exactly constitutes informed consent?I thought it was a fascinating read, and while it appealed to my Science background by explaining the advances made, and the complications that arose, it also brought to light the bittersweet story of the family that thought they had lost their mother, and never knew that a little piece of her still existed until years after her death.A powerful read I'd recommend to everyone."
416,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101060033-woman-reading,4,"In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (ILHL), Skloot blends the Lacks' family history with that of medical sciences and all against a backdrop of systemic racism. For decades, her cell line, named HeLa, has far eclipsed the woman of their origin. Henrietta Lacks was born in 1920 as the ninth child of Eliza and Johnny Pleasant in Roanoke, Virginia. When Eliza died after birthing her tenth child in 1924, the family was divided amongst the larger network of relatives who pitched in to raise the children. Henrietta and David Lacks, her first cousin and future spouse, were raised together by their grandfather Tommy in a former slaves quarter cabin in Lacks Town (Clover), Virginia. Lacks Town had been the inheritance carved out of Henrietta's white great grandfather Albert Lacks' tobacco plantation in the late 1800s.From Skloot's interviews with relatives, Henrietta was a generously hospitable, hard working, and loving mother whose premature death led to enormous consequences for her children. Henrietta suspected a health problem a year before her fifth and last child was born. She went to Johns Hopkins, a renowned medical institution and a charity hospital, in Baltimore and received a diagnosis of cervical cancer in January 1951. (view spoiler)[Since cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, it seems likely that she had contracted the virus from her husband, who had not been monogamous. (hide spoiler)]During her first treatment for cancer, malignant cells were removed - without Henrietta's knowledge - and cultivated in a lab environment by Johns Hopkins researchers attempting to uncover cancer's secrets. Although the brachytherapy with radium was initially deemed a success, Henrietta's brown skin turned black as the cancer aggressively metastasized. After several weeks of great pain, Henrietta died in October 1951.ILHL raises questions about the extent to which we own our bodies, informed consent, and ethics surrounding the research of anything human. The HeLa line was a rare scientific success as those malignant cells thrived in lab conditions and eventually became crucial to thousands of research projects. Skloot reported that in 2009, an average human body was worth anywhere from $10,000 to $150,000. In the case of John Moore who had leukemia, his cell line was valued in millions of dollars. To prevent human trafficking, it is illegal to sell human organs and tissues, but they can be donated while processing fees are assessed.As a charity hospital in the 1950s, segregated patient wards in Johns Hopkins were filled with African Americans whose tissue samples were regarded by researchers as ""payment."" One cannot ""donate"" what one doesn't know. The Lacks family discovered HeLa's existence 22 years after Henrietta died. They've struggled to pay their medical costs while biotechnology companies have reaped profits from cultivating and selling HeLa cells. In 1999, the Rand Corporation estimated that 307 million tissue samples from  178 million  people (almost 60 percent of the population) were stored in the US for research purposes. Although the US is nowhere close to definitively addressing the questions raised by ILHL , a little progress has been made. In 1974, the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects (the ""Common Rule"") required informed consent for federally funded research. The Common Rule was passed in response to egregious and inhumane experiments such as the Tuskegee Syphilis project and another scientist who wanted to know whether injecting people with HeLa would give them cancer. Note that this rule exempts privately funded research. In 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) made it illegal for health practitioners and insurers to make one's medical information public without their consent. This was after researchers had published medical information about the Lacks family. It should be evident that human tissues have long been monetized. One method of creating monopoly - like control has been to obtain a patent. As of 2005, the US has issued patents for about 20 percent of all known human genes. Myriad Genetics patented two genes - BRCA1 and BRCA2 - indicative of breast and ovarian cancer. In 2009 the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), on behalf of scientists, sued Myriad Genetics. In 2013, the US Supreme Court gave the victory to the ACLU and invalidated the patents, thus lowering future research costs and obliquely taking a step toward defining ownership of the human body."
417,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27117957-stephanie-anze,5,"Henrietta Lacks was a mother to four children and about to become one for the fifth time when she started to feel sick. After the birth of her son, she only grew sicker. At John Hopkins, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer and underwent treatment. Unfortunately, the cancer spread quickly and Henrietta died. Before her death, a sample of her cancerous tissue was taken and cultivated in the lab. Her cells grew at an unprecedated rate and became extremely valuable to the scientific realm. Called HeLa, Henrietta's cells were the first to reach ""immortality"". Her family did not know this information for several years. This is the story of the woman behind the cells.I began reading more non-fiction books last year and have since come across some amazing works. 'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' will join those ranks. Hands down, this is one of the best non-fiction books written. Broad-in-scope, thought-provocking, awe-inspiring and jaw-dropping, this book is the perfect marriage between science and human interest. Greatly researched and with much heart, the prose is magnificent. Henrietta Lacks was a poor tobacco farmer, descended from slaves. When she was diagnosed with cervical cancer, she did not particularly stand out but when her cancerous tissue was cultivated in the Hopkins lab, that was a different story. Until HeLa, scientists had not been able to produce a cell line that perdured. With HeLa cells, however, they hit the jackpot. Used in everything from the development of vaccines to genetic research and even to test out the effects of a nuclear bomb, the impact of these cells is immesurable. Just one problem, Henrietta did not give consent to give her cells and her family did not learn of just how important Henrietta was until many years after her death. About 50 miillion metric tons of HeLa cells have been produced to date, more than enough cells to populate a village full of Henriettas. While Henritta never travelled far form her home, her cells have been all over the world and even into outer space. They have been infected with several illnesses and combined with other cells. Odds are eah of us has, in some way, come in contact with HeLa.The way in which Skloot balances the science aspect with the human asprct of the book is done with finnesse. The HeLa cells are something impressive but more so is the woman behind them. Henrietta was strong, confident and resourceful. By all accounts, she faced her cancer diagnosis with sheer bravery and never stopped thinking about her family, even when she knew she would not survive. Its truly sad that for that Henriettas's cells did for the world, her heirs do not even know where the exact location of her grave is. What stood out for me most was the relationship that developed between Sloot and Deborah (Henrietta's daughter). Until Skloot, most were merely interested in the cells with Henrietta as an afterthought. I love that Skloot focused on Henrietta. Its time she gets the recognition that is way overdue.This work raises many questions. With the ""Tissue Issue"", consent and scientific progress are at a standstill. Henrietta's cells were taken without her knowledge or that of her family. The exact amount of money made off the HeLa cells is not known but its exorbitant. Her family never saw a cent and sadly struggle to pay their health insurance. Biological ownership is a tricky subject matter. The John Moore case was one of the cases that put it on the map and it has been a hot botton issue since. While there are some basic rules to follow, the gist is that once any tissue is ""abandoned"" at a hospital, it ceases to be property of the patient. Blood tests, biopsies and tissue taken from surgeries are property of the hospital and they have no obligation to let their patients know if and for what their tissues can be used. The scientific communty argues that to seek consent would lead to a decreased access to materials or have people seek financial gain. Personally, I find this troubling. The moral and ethical concerns are overwhelming and getting to an agreement between both parties is a battle. Scientific progress is important but at what cost? This is a book that will stay with me for a while. Its up there with 'The Radium Girls' (another great non-fiction work). Highly recommended!"
418,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher,2,"2.5 stars. I found the 1st 1/2 of this book fascinating and eagerly awaited to hear more of Henrietta's story. Henrietta was someone you couldn't help but root for and you were amazed to hear of her strength and perpetual optimism. The 2nd 1/2 of this book was tedious and annoying. The book started to drag and focus too much on the researcher's hardships, but mostly, I found Henrietta's family to be utterly unlikable. I kept thinking of that saying, ""I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you"". I felt much of the Lacks family, particularly Deborah and Joe (who changed his name to the long Z name), enjoyed being miserable. Despite being corrected again and again on their misbeliefs, they would resort right back to harboring on their anger/hatred/anxiousness over falsities. I felt their actions reflected a disregard for much of the advancements that came about from their mother's indirect contribution to medicine, but focused instead on a victim mentality and desire for monetary contribution - monetary contribution for something they had absolutely nothing to do with and had not worked for one iota.  As for the ethics surrounding Henrietta's cells being taken, be it right or wrong, she was not treated any differently than rich white patients were at that time when it came to taking cells/tissue without informed consent. In that sense, I don't think she was personally wronged in an intentional manner, though I think it's crazy what could be done without informed consent at that time. If you want to talk about who was wronged in an intentional manner, we'll talk about Elsie. Furthermore, I'm not completely convinced that some things were not explained to Henrietta regarding sampling cells. It was stated by Henrietta and the Lacks family time and again that they often came away with a poor understanding after speaking with MDs, yet they did not ask further questions or state their lack of understanding. Therefore, anytime it was exclaimed they were told ""nothing"", I had doubts. Henrietta's cells as they were taken, were of very little worth. It was the ingenuity of the people that used them that gave them their worth. Should Henrietta have received a modest compensation? Perhaps, it's muddled for me. Organ donors do not receive compensation (or their families). The reward is knowing you have saved other's lives. Should her children be entitled to compensation decades later for advancements that continue to be made 50 years after the cells were taken - cells that were not even from their own body? Definitely not. Is her family entitled to give permission for what can and cannot be done to Henrietta's cells? Absolutely not. Informed consent (which was not legally required at that time) is between the patient and the MD - what other family members wish is insignificant. The most interesting part of this story for me was easily Henrietta's story. Her childhood, the abuse of the time to the poor and minorities, the overt racist culture, and her strong optimistic nature that she maintained despite the world burning around her. The part that made the story a chore to finish was the ignorance that the family clung to despite being informed of truths, and the smallness with which they appreciated the lives that have been saved due to the awful cancer their mother acquired compared to the greatness with which they felt they deserved money as a result of research and ingenuity that they had never participated in, let alone understood. Azle - 7/16"
419,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt,5,"This remarkable story about how people live on sometimes in the material way just as much as in memory, about science, ethics, the search for a cure to a potentially deadly disease, well, it's unforgettable and unlike any other book because it wasn't just her cells that kept Henrietta alive after her death - it was her family, whose lives were transformed upon hearing of her story and the research done on cells taken without her consent. "
420,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"For a non-fiction book about science, this book is pretty interesting. Chapters about genes, cloning and cancer are juxtaposed with chapters about Henrietta's personal life and about the author's interactions with the Lacks family. I think this book would scare a lot of people about how privacy is dealt with as a legal issue in the medical community. The book is about Henrietta Lacks - a woman whose cells live on and on to be experimented with, cloned, put into space, blown up, used to make human-animal and human-plant hybrids, etc. The point of the book is that these cells were taken from her without her knowledge or consent. Today, no one in her family can afford medical care, even though their mother/grandmother's cells are stored by the billions in laboratories around the world. This brings up many interesting points in debates about what rights the medical community has to do procedures 'for the benefit of humankind' vs. the rights of the individual and patient. Do your cells and tissues belong to you? Do they still belong to you, even when removed from your body? It is surprising how fuzzy the laws still are on this issue. The book also touches a little bit on racism - Henrietta was black, and the doctors who took and distributed her cells were white. But racism isn't the main focus. I found this book fascinating - and cell research isn't really my forte. I recommend this book, even to people who generally don't read or like non-fiction."
421,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,5,I read this book back in 2013 just before I joined Goodreads. I found my review on Audible and decided to add it to Goodreads for my records.This is a well written non-fiction book that provides back ground information about unfair treatment of minorities by medical research. Cassandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin did a great job with the narration of the book. The story of Henrietta Lacks and her family is interesting and the discovery and care of the Hi La cells. One major item about the family is the lack of education that played a major role in their understanding and ability to control the situation. The book accomplishes its goal of promoting proper documentation of biological tissue research. It raises the question of ownership of our own tissues and whether or not we have proprietary rights to our bodies in situ or in vitro. This question needs to be answered NOW not in the future. The other teaching of the book was how important education is to each individual. This is an absolute must read book for everyone on this planet.

424,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"I blew through this fascinating audiobook, practically manufacturing housework to do so that I'd have an excuse to plug myself in (okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration; there was plenty of housework to do without my having to manufacture any). I would recommend this book to just about anyone seeking a great read -- even if you're usually more of a fiction person, this non-fiction book offers plenty of interesting characters and storylines as well as being informative and provocative in the way of non-fiction.Did you know that much of medical research (and the benefits we derive every day, including many routine vaccines and medications we take for granted) is dependent on a culture of human cells that continue to live and reproduce even after their original owner died in 1951? Well, I didn't. And I wouldn't have thought that this factoid would interest me particularly, not being much of a science person myself. But somehow, Rebecca Skloot was able to make the dynamics surrounding these cells not only comprehensible to me but intriguing (no small feat). Even more intriguing, though, was the story of the late human being behind these cells, Henrietta Lacks, who never knew that her cells had been taken for research. Henrietta's surviving children, tragically losing their mother at a young age to cervical cancer and raised in a poor and abusive environment, only learned about this later in life and never saw a penny of the proceeds.""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" contains several stories. There is the story of Henrietta, a poor young African American woman with incurable cervical cancer, and of her children struggling to grow up without her after her early death. There is the story of the doctor who decided to slice off pieces of her tumor just prior to her death without asking or even informing her, who then discovered that these cancerous cells were immortal. There is the story of the cells, which began to be mass-produced and distributed to researchers for a wide variety of interesting and often ground-breaking experiments. And there is the story of Rebecca Skloot, a journalist who was persistent and dogged in her efforts to win Henrietta's family's reluctant trust (after they had been duped by others attempting to capitalize on Henrietta) so that she could learn and tell their story.Henrietta's adult children in this book are colorful characters with their own stories who overcame some difficult situations, some more successfully than others. We also meet different doctors and researchers -- while some prove to be profiteers, others are truly dedicated to science for its own sake. The doctor who originally took Henrietta's tumor for research without her knowledge fell into the latter category, which is part of what makes this a three-dimensional book rather than a simplistic polemic. A product of his times, this 1950s doctor was less sensitive to the medical and research ethics which have since received more attention, particularly when it came to a poor African-American woman. Should you care if someone uses your body tissues for medical research without your consent? Before I began reading this book, my thought was, why the heck would I care? Assuming that these tissues need to be removed in any case, why not use them to do some good for science and for mankind? But Rebecca offers some anecdotes which complicate this question, and the irony running throughout the book is that Henrietta's descendants cannot afford decent medical care, even as the entire medical profession benefits from Henrietta's unwittingly donated cells.Even if you think you're not a science person, even if you think you're not a non-fiction person, I would recommend checking this book out."
425,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"On the threshold between medicine and ethics.This book talks about ethical and legal conflicts, historically raised by the discovery of immortal cells that changed medicine and patients life's for the better. It‘s an astonishing story you probably didn‘t hear about before:In 1951 a colored poor woman named Henrietta Lacks walked into the Hopkins University, where a doctor extracted cells from her large cervix tumor, that killed her briefly after. But as they discovered in the laboratory, those were anything but normal cells, but the first immortal human cells grown in culture. They are still alive today and were replicated to millions and spread to laboratories all over the world, though Lacks has been dead for more than sixty years. They called them HeLa cells and they were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. What interested me the most was the scientific and legal part of that book. Ultimately it‘s a question of property and if we have the right on our cells, once they leave our body, particularly if we don‘t know about it.First there is the problem with uninformed consent. Henrietta did not provide informed consent for her cells to be used, she didn‘t have knowledge. Beyond that people were later unknowingly injected with her tumor cells, for the purpose of medical research. The same was performed on healthy prisoners with their knowledge, though their free consent seems to be questionable. They developed tumors, sometimes killing them. Furthermore her autopsy report was later published in the book of a journalist, the family didn‘t knew about and didn‘t want to see published. The question is the violation of privacy rights.The second problem are genetic rights/non-rights. Her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later, and didn‘t fully approve of it‘s usage A big focus also are patents and profits for biologic material.Henrietta and her family were very poor and didn’t even have health insurance. They received zero profits, while her cells sell for multiple-millions until today.Very shocking are also racism claims. Because the cells were discovered in the 50, making public that white people were treated with cell stems of a black woman would have had a major impact. Additionally implications are made, that colored people were categorically abused, abducted, purposely infected and killed to perform medical experiments. The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications, but actual, valuable people and historic events.What I didn’t like just as much though, is how the story is told at times, jumping between characters and writing styles; sometimes loosing the silver lining. The writing is very simple and doesn’t at all feel factual. As a non fiction fan, I miss that at times but I guess that others appreciate it even more. It reads a lot like a novel, particularly since a lot of content is told through conversations. In conclusion a super interesting story I won’t forget quickly!"
426,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna,5,"What a wonderful book! It describes the life of Henrietta Lacks and her family, the origin of the HeLa cell line (the first human immortal cell line), the research conducted with these cells, and also the author’s research and interviews in unfolding this story.“I’ve tried to imagine how she’d feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. I’m pretty sure that she—like most of us—would be shocked to hear that there are trillions more of her cells growing in laboratories now than there ever were in her body.” "

This book can satisfy several audiences on several different levels. The technical information about the science of cells is fascinating. The ethical questions raised by the unauthorized use of someone's cells are important to ask and ponder. But most fascinating is the story of the Lacks family. Skloot's exhaustive research spanned a decade and she tells a story that is honest, heart wrenching and provocative. "
428,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl,5,"This is one stellar piece of nonfiction that has a bit of everything in it for everybody. Beautifully written and structured because it is clear that while there's SOoo much information here, it is arranged in such a way that you don't get lost. Sure the author is a science writer, but she's also a creative nonfiction writer so the book doesn't read like a nonfiction textbook, and has the plot structure of fiction. Some chapters tell the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family, others take you on the research journey with Rebecca Skloot. The interactions she has with the family makes for light, sometimes humorous reading. In fact, the chronology is done in a way to make the book more interesting. The book is as much about family, as it is about science, history, racial tensions, and of one extraordinary black woman who has done more for medical research and advancements, than anything or anyone the industry has seen. It will have you crying, laughing, yelling at people...you name it. Born in 1920, Henrietta Lacks was thirty years old when she went to see a doctor for ""spotting"" and pain, and started getting treatments for cervical cancer (mind you, in the ""colored"" wards of John Hopkins. This was during the Jim Crow era). The researcher/doctor who treated her, collected samples of her cells (without her knowledge) while he placed radium inside of her. She soon deteriorated and each time she went in for treatment, her cells were taken and stored. Yet she knew nothing of the cells growing in a lab, or the fact that she was now infertile because of her cancer treatment. When she died, her husband signed paperwork to have an autopsy performed, because he was under the impression that doctors would find out if his children were predisposed to whatever his wife had, not knowing that his signature allowed his wife's body to be cut open to help with more research.This is the breadth of the story I think. A story about an African-American woman whose life and death seemed to be an irony--she wasn't allowed to mention her white, slave-owning family, yet she was buried next to them. She wasn't allowed to use the ""white-only"" medical facilities, yet her cells were mixed with white cells. In science cell culture, there were no other cells with the ability to multiply and stay immortal like hers. So every major medical breakthrough, like polio vaccine for example, came from the usage of her cells. The main thrust is, she didn't know. Her family didn't know, and they didn't find out until twenty years later because the name Henrietta Lacks was hidden by the doctors who used her cells as research. Scientists made millions from her body and her family had tons of health issues, with no help from their mother's cells and no health insurance. ""A search of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database turns up more than seventeen thousand patents involving HeLa Cells,"" Skloot wrote. But Henrietta's son Lawrence wanted to know, ""She's the most important woman in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""There they were, at a time when the country was learning about the ""Tuskegee Syphilis Study"" (where African-American men with syphilis were recruited for research, then made to die slow, painful deaths even after their researchers realized that penicillin would cure them), and cells from a black woman was being used to save millions of Americans, mostly white.In this book, Skloot brings the woman behind the cells to life, talks about her life, her troubled marriage, her children. She develops a relationship with Deborah, Henrietta's daughter who suffered the most from all of it. She talks to scientists and researchers. She brings in history. She talks about race tensions and shows how when slavery was abolished, African-Americans became slaves to another master: medicine. I'll admit, at times it was an emotional roller coaster for me, but one quote from Deborah stood out for me and should for you:""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different.""So anybody should be able to read this book because the way in which it is written, is not to point fingers (not even at the medical industry because the author manages to explain those times as well) but to glean the truth. To finally give credit where credit is due, and to educate. To honor a woman, a mother, a wife, whose body makes it possible for us to get some of the modern medical treatments that we get today. This is one book I will remember, that's for sure! "
429,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon,4,"In 1951, Henrietta Lacks passed away due to complications arising from cervical cancer. Following her death, cancerous cells were harvested from her body and used in ongoing experiments regarding the growth of cells outside the human body. Previous to Henrietta, scientists could only make it a few days before the cells would ultimately die, forcing them to start all over. Henrietta’s cells were different, they grew at an astounding rate and researchers were able to keep them alive. Since the discovery, they've been used in countless experiments and led to numerous scientific breakthroughs - most notably the polio vaccine.Today, Henrietta’s cells usually go for a few hundred dollars a vial but her descendants live in poverty. While many of her children believe they should be compensated for the sale of HeLa cells, court cases involving similar claims have always found in favor of research companies rather than individuals - the argument being that once a procedure is performed and tissue is removed from a body, it is no longer of use to the individual and the hospital can do with it as it pleases, be it incineration or study. On one hand, it makes sense given that it was highly doubtful Henrietta’s husband could have opened a cellular research facility, however, the problem lies within the fact that researchers did not tell Henrietta’s family about the importance of HeLa cells and lied to her children when additional bloodwork was requested for further study.The story of the Lacks family is a heartbreaking one. Henrietta had a terrible upbringing and following her death, things became that much worse for her children. While the book mainly concentrates on the HeLa cells, there’s a shocking piece on her daughter Elsie, who had been diagnosed with “idiocy” and institutionalized at Crownsville Hospital Centre (a.k.a. The Hospital for the Negro Insane) following her mother’s death. The conditions at the time of Elsie’s arrival were deplorable. They had a total of eight attendants (four in the day, four in the evening) for five hundred and sixty patients. One ward in particular had seventy eight patients with only twenty eight beds. There were also only three toilets to share amongst them all. You can imagine how much this upset the family when they found out decades later.While The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks can be deeply upsetting, it is without a doubt an important book. Author Rebecca Skloot spent years interviewing the Lacks family (which at times was certainly no easy task) and researching Henrietta’s life and death, all information that had been buried over time. The story flows well and her afterword provides greater insight into the legal ramifications of future soft tissue research. Henrietta’s youngest daughter Deborah always wanted the world to know about the person behind the HeLa cells, the real human being who provided the ammunition for several medical discoveries. Thanks to Rebecca’s tireless work, Henrietta Lacks' incredible true story is out there for the world to see.Also posted @ Every Read Thing."

Some people comment on the human interest aspect of the story with regard to the Lacks family. Other people mention the cell science. For me, the most interesting thing was the history of informed consent, or the ""Lacks"" thereof. (Go ahead and laugh now at my clever wordplay. You know you want to.)It's hard to believe the bizarre ways people's bodies were used for medical research, with or without their consent. Even when they did give consent, they did so without being told exactly what would be done to their bodies. Too often the people used for the studies were the poor, the uneducated, and prison inmates. Back in the forties and fifties, ""Many scientists believed that since patients were treated for free in the public wards, it was fair to use them as research subjects as a form of payment."" YIKES! That's not just unethical, it's abominable.Rebecca Skloot's dedication to the research and writing of this story is remarkable. She spent pretty much the entire decade of her twenties in pursuit of the truth about Henrietta Lacks and her ""immortal"" cells. My only reason for not awarding the full five stars is that I thought the book could have used one more ruthless edit before final printing. "

Clearly, a result of hard work and intense research and, above all the fact that the author has taken student loans and used her credit cards for the research work and had no other backing or support.

436,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66292681-sarah-lumos,4,"  “Henrietta’s (cells) were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.”  Argh, I feel embarrassed admitting this, but before reading this book, I had no idea what the HeLa cells were. I never studied science in-depth, which is now one of my biggest regrets. However, I guess in some ways I was lucky: I got to know who Henrietta Lacks was before meeting her famous cells. In this well-researched biography, Rebecca Skloot tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, a poor Black woman who was only 31 when she died from cervical cancer. While she was getting treatments at John Hopkins Hospital, Dr. George Guy took cells from Lack’s tumor without her consent. After examining her cells, Guy felt amazed. He realized her cells were unlike any he had seen - Henrietta’s cells refused to die.HeLa would become the first immortal cell line grown in a lab. For scientists, this discovery was monumental. It would allow them to conduct experiments they never could before. Henrietta’s cells would later help create in vitro fertilization, polio vaccines, and cancer treatments. Although HeLa cells have affected each of us in different ways, before this book’s publication, most of us had little to no idea who Henrietta Lacks was.Here is what I found riveting: Henrietta never graduated from high school, yet she became one of the most important people in science. Sure, science has its own explanation for how this happened, but her family believed God chose Henrietta. God wanted her to come back to Earth in the form of her cells to help others. Since the Lacks had a weak science background, faith was their way of understanding what happened to Henrietta, and making sense of the non-sensical. Though most of the Lacks were happy Henrietta’s cells were advancing science, some of them were mad. The Lacks had no science education, and scientists never bothered to explain to them what happened to Henrietta in a simple way. Researchers exploited their ignorance and the Lacks were never able to give informed consent. Their frustrations are understandable. I felt like giving each of them a hug when I read these passages. If I were them, I would be upset too. While HeLa cells were becoming a multi-million dollar industry, the Lacks were living in poverty, barely able to afford health insurance:   “...the last thing he remembered before falling into unconsciousness under anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened to medicine. Sonny woke up more than $125,000 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery.”  I also admire Skloot's grit because this was a massive project to undertake. I can understand why this book took her a decade to write. I think she wanted to do Henrietta's story justice, and she did. Skloot made sure the world knew about the Lacks and what they did for science. Furthermore, I liked that Skloot’s discussed the social determinants of health. Her clear prose helped me better understand patient rights, inequalities in medicine, informed consent, and tissue ownership laws. Overall, “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" was a magnificent treat. I am positive other readers will find this book as informative and awe-inspiring as I did."
437,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Skloot delivers a mix of science history and human interest in her journalistic style. She discusses medical ethics particularly the issue of informed consent as she tells the story of Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta was a poor black woman who joined the great migration of the 1940’s moving from rural southern Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. She was treated for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins, the only nearby hospital that would admit blacks in 1951. After suffering through the then standard radium therapy, she died that same year. Samples of her tumor were removed and became the first successful human cell culture to sustain itself. Known as HeLa her cells live on today in labs around the world the subject of endless experimentation. Most of the book is spent on Henrietta’s life, her daughter Deborah, their families and extended relations as well as the author’s work with the family to research the book. We follow Henrietta from her childhood in the 1920’s growing up in former slave quarters on the wrong side of the tracks in the small tobacco country town of Clover, Virginia. Skloot gives a somewhat romanticized version of what must have been a harsh life of poverty and discrimination. Similarly Skloot tries to bring out the positives while dutifully reporting the difficult lives of Henrietta’s descendants who suffer from chronic mental and physical illnesses, limited education and continued discrimination in the Baltimore area. Particularly interesting to me was the communication gap between the scientists and Henrietta’s working class African American family. A big part of the problem was the history of exploitation of African Americans by white doctors and their medical institutions. This history had been internalized into a pervasive distrust of doctors and hospitals by Henrietta’s family. Henrietta’s and her family’s fear is understandable and it struck me as part of a broader issue. With unarmed black men dying regularly at the hands of the police, we see similar fears by African Americans today. Skloot points out that scientific progress was made from practices that now would be clearly unethical. Henrietta’s cells sped up the development of the Polio vaccine in the early 1950’s saving many from this devastating disease. Concepts such as informed consent did not exist in 1951. Even today the issue is very murky which the author addresses in her afterword. At the end of the book Skloot returns to Clover to find it gone. All the ramshackle old buildings torn down, just empty fields remaining. Most of those who knew Henrietta had now passed on too. Only her cells remain, thriving in labs everywhere and generating the ground breaking medical discoveries of a new era. "
438,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2528841-claire,5,"In the same way we sometimes debate whether the story should be seen as an entirely seperate entity to the writer, so too do scientists perceive a sample of cell tissue as seperate to the human body it was extracted from. Except that it is not possible to extract a story from a writer's imagination without their consent. Henrietta Lacks was a young mother in her early thirties when she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer that would quickly take her life. She was fortunate to live close to the John Hopkins hospital, set up to ensure equal access to medical care for all' no matter their race, status, income or any other characteristic that might have otherwise given cause to discriminate.Before undergoing treatment, one of the Doctors took a tissue sample of her healthy cells and the cancerous cells, as he had been doing to most patients, in an effort to try and find cells that would continue to replicate without dying - the elusive ""immortal"" cell. It had never been done successfully with human cells before.He succeeded and the cells became known the world over as he gave them away freely, known as HeLa cells, the immortal human cells that never died and could be used over and over again to test for cures to disease and to observe how cells react to numerous variables, furthering science in ways unimaginable previously. Few paused to ask who the woman behind these cells was, what was her story, how did her family feel about this multi million dollar research industry that was making great strides in science yes, and also making entrepreneurial types wealthy in the process.Rebecca Skloot made Henrietta the subject of her research for 10 years in the creation of this thorough, respectful account of the life of Henrietta Lacks and her journey to uncover the events of the time within the context of what was the norm in her day. In much of it she is accompanied by Henriettas daughter Deborah, a passionate woman who was unable to find peace in her own life, until she had helped bring her mother's story to light.A brilliant and informative story and piece of scientific medical history that reads like a novel and brings our awareness to the many who unknowingly make sacrifices for the better of others and that always present aspect of those hovering in the wings, recognising an opportunity to profit."
439,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6584206-leslie-reese,5,"There is no getting around the fact that this is an incredibly necessary and important American story. The votes have been in for years: author Rebecca Skloot’s book racked up 19 significant awards and citations in 2010 when it was first published. The 2011 trade paperback edition I read boasts five pages of exuberant blurbs before you even get to the title page. I wanted to be a curmudgeon about it, but the story is so serious that I had to relinquish my pissy attitude. It is just that type of story: a sensational true crime story with ramifications in the fields of health and science; race and sociology; ethics, history, and journalism. Suspenseful, cinematic, and factual, Ms. Skloot manages to pack it all inside of 310 pages, with 71 pages remaining for appendices, acknowledgements, notes, and discussion group questions! She writes knowledgeably, intelligently, compassionately, and skillfully. This book is all that! The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family. It is about the miraculous and immortal cells---taken from her cervix without her permission in 1951 and how they have been serving medical research ever since. It is a story about her daughter, Deborah, and a science journalist (Rebecca Skloot) dedicating years of her life to questioning, investigating, researching, and writing. It is about injustice and justice; human liberties, and privileging science over human life and the right to make informed decisions. This book chillingly illustrates the complex path of ethics and medical research in the United States from the 1950s to the present. It made me mad, but it also educated me in a profound way."

In fact this is the first book to keep me so intellectually and emotionally engaged in a very long time. I struggle to find the words to express what it meant to read about the plight of this woman and the medical knowledge gained from her cells. To read this book is to begin to understand the impact of these cells on modern medicine. Then the book takes you further to read about what has happened to her family during these medical breakthroughs, the impact of what happened and its influences on the laws and the practice of medicine. Just an amazing book with so many elements intertwined and presented with such empathy and beauty. As a brief aside, shortly after I finished the book I had a minor medical procedure performed. Before they would begin, the patient must sign a medical release form and on the form was a statement asking the patient to relinquish all rights of ownership to any tissue samples removed. After reading this book I understand the implications (signed it, but was much more aware of the rationale behind it). This was a life affecting book for me. I didn't close the book thinking that I knew the answers to the ethical questions it raised. What I did feel was that it just seemed some how unjust that her family fared so poorly when her cells were so vital to so many of the scientific advancements made after her death. It presented legal and ethical quandaries that some of the finest legal minds still haven't wrapped their minds around. Engaging and enlightening book? And how!! Highly recommended!!!"

As someone who is strongly considering donating my body to science when I die, this was a probative read to think about the changing ethics of medicine, and a reminder that so much scientific development has been done on unwilling, non-consenting, and uninformed individuals. Top among these unwitting contributors, must rank Henrietta Lacks, whose indomitable cancer cells have led to inestimable developments. Though the ethics have tissue collection has drastically changed since the 1950s, it is surprising how much of a wild, wild west this area remains.

“Everybody in the world got her cells, only thing we got of our mother is just them medical records and her Bible.”
In 1951 doctors at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore diagnosed an unusually extreme case of cervical cancer. The breakneck growth rate and resistance to common remedies were unlike anything previously seen. Without informed consent, the doctor scraped a clump of cells from the cancerous tumor during one of the 30 year-old woman’s visits and deposited them with a nearby cell culture lab operated by George Gey. There, in the air-controlled space of Gey’s facility, something happened that researchers had long suspected out of reach. Where countless other cells before them had died, hers survived, and multiplied indefinitely. The immortality of this one cell line would prove instrumental in treating a number of the world’s most heavy-hitting diseases and set the stage for an all new era in cell research, medical diagnosis, drug development and bioethics. But this is a story not just about bundles of cells, but about the humanity behind them, and in particular the family to which they will forever be tied.That woman was Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta passed away just nine months after diagnosis, but it would be more than two decades before her family received word of the namesake cell line which survived her—HeLa. Its value as a scientific and commercial commodity was paramount, getting bogged down in the thicket of rights and privacy less so. Once researchers discovered that Henrietta’s cells did not die but instead bred a new generation every twenty-four hours, HeLa quickly became the tireless workhorse of the culture community. Vials were trucked to research facilities around the world, where they were regularly exposed to a pavilion of infectious diseases, merged with non-human DNA, and even shot into space in an effort to study the influence of zero gravity.Over time, details about the parent of the eponymous cells funneled out of view. Henrietta’s own kin were oblivious to the fact that her cells lived, were being studied and tested in dozens of countries, and were being exchanged at great profit. Once the unwitting donor’s official name was released, journalists descended in full fervor, leading to a lifetime of turmoil and unrest for the Lacks household. Set against the rich legacy of the family’s cells, their life of poverty and unpaid medical bills seemed untoward by comparison, and this sense of injustice only mounted as more details filtered in from the press.Rebecca Skloot’s segue into this lush narrative was by and large a product of serendipitous circumstance, having first heard of HeLa in an intro to biology course at her local community college. After learning that these cells had lived outside their host's body for the better part of a century, and about the remarkable advances they have gifted to science, Skloot shot up her hand and innocently asked, ""Who was she?"" The professor's reply proved unsatisfying: ""An African American woman."" The seed of curiosity had been planted. By the time Skloot graduated she'd decided to write a book to recover the disremembered woman whose cells had won so many victories for science and society.Who Was Henrietta Lacks?For more than a decade, Skloot layered herself into the Lacks’ story, befriending and forming deep bonds with Henrietta’s children and cousinry. She forges an especially strong connection with Deborah Lacks, Henrietta’s youngest daughter, who was unfortunately too young to remember much about her mother. With a mix of patience and persistence the two work together to dig up Henrietta’s heritage and bring to light her hitherto uncelebrated legacy. It is Skloot’s at times unstable relationship and camaraderie with Deborah that gives the narrative its steam, as the two probe ever deeper into the mystery surrounding her mother.Tracing the family’s roots places Henrietta’s childhood at the tail end of the Jim Crow era, a time when segregation meant a great deal more than which bathroom and water fountain one was required to use. Rampant legal disadvantages in the South bred systemic, institutionalized maladjustment for blacks, and this included limited access to medical care. Having spent her youth on a slave plantation in Clover, Virginia, Henrietta joined in the Great Migration at the ripened age of twenty-one, exchanging her familiarity with tobacco fields for a new life in Baltimore. Nine years later, she would be diagnosed with the malignancy that led to her iconic cell line. And it would be another fifty years before Deborah, with the help of Skloot, laid eyes on her mother’s original medical records.Johns Hopkins Hospital was founded for the express purpose of treating Baltimore's poor and, unlike today, informed consent upon providing blood or tissue samples was neither required by law nor common practice (the term did not even appear in a court document until 1957). Like everyone at the time, Henrietta hadn't a clue about what would become of her excised genetic material and the boons it would lavish upon the scientific community. This became a flashpoint issue in the years that followed as the occasional patient attempted to turn a gray area into a lucrative venture. While we learned more about DNA and transmissible disease, Henrietta's resilient cells inaugurated an international conversation on the commercialization of biological materials and where exactly the donors fit within that ecosystem. In many ways, the conversation is ongoing. (Skloot includes a superb summary in the afterword which draws together the various threads of this nuanced debate.) The HeLa LegacyTo properly gauge the vastitude of the legacy tied up in Henrietta’s cells, it’s important to understand 20th century cell culture. Until Henrietta came along, cell immortality was a pipe dream. While standard, non-cancerous cells had been grown in vitro since 1907, none of them survived long enough to endure important testing, petering out after 50 divisions, on average. Even cancer cells, like those common to cervical cancers, died shortly after relocation to the culture environment. This meant not only was there a brief window for experimentation but that a continuous supply of fresh cells was needed to sustain research. Many in the field yearned for a better way.HeLa keynoted a paradigm shift. They were robust enough to survive in the bricolage of materials used in Dr. Gey’s culture medium, and they were susceptible to the same range of infectious diseases as were normal cells. This allowed researchers to inject the lively DNA with diseases as well as cures. Not merely a boon to science, this revolutionized the field, so much so that one of the researchers Skloot interviews in the book, when asked what would happen if HeLa was pulled from research use, replied, “Restricting HeLa cell use would be disastrous. The impact that would have on science is inconceivable.” (p. 328)Thanks to Dr. Gey’s partnering efforts with labs around the globe, the benefits of HeLa manifested seemingly overnight. In just one year after HeLa’s genesis, Jonas Salk and his team were able to derive a vaccine for polio by infecting HeLa cells, followed shortly by drug treatments for HPV, herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia and Parkinson’s disease. In 1953 HeLa became the first cells to be cloned successfully. In total, some 60,000 papers have been published on HeLa, and cell culturists still use her cancer cells as a model for human biology.What was it exactly that gave HeLa cells their added dose of moxie? Even today, we can only speculate. We now know that Henrietta was infected with both HPV and syphilis, so one theory is that this virulent combination may have helped suppress PCD. A rival theory suggests she had highly atypical genes to begin with, perhaps a rare mutation, that enabled the cancer to spiral in unspecified directions. We still are uncertain. HeLa has also been the source of much frustration over the years from regularly contaminating other cell lines, often halting research until the botch-up is sorted.Closing ThoughtsRebecca Skloot’s ten-year effort is a literary and cultural marvel balanced between unsheathing the posthumous success and humanity behind one of the richest narratives in science and laying bare the bioethical implications to which it is attached. It succeeds on both fronts. Skloot is at her most animating when channeling the lens of Deborah Lacks as they band together to reach some much-needed closure to the saga thrust upon the Lacks family. With her first book, Skloot has demonstrated in equal measure her facility for conveying scientific nuance while weaving meaning and poetic force into a cohesive whole. Yes, this is first and foremost a work of nonfiction, but its pages are emblazoned with enough touches of novel-like charisma to beckon both crowds. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a timeless story delivered by a gifted writer and the definitive presentation of the legacy Henrietta never lived to see. Highly recommended.Skloot also founded The Henrietta Lacks Foundation - click here for more - to provide support for the Lacks as well as assistance to African Americans pursuing education in science and medicine. A portion of her book’s proceeds are donated to the Foundation.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."
445,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7983564-kaora,4,"A really powerful read about HeLa cells, taken without consent from a woman named Henrietta Lacks. Her cells contributed to many of modern medicines discoveries, including the polio vaccine and gene mapping, and yet her family is still so poor they cannot afford health care hacing seen none of the money generated by these cells.This book explores the debate about what makes up a person's body. Is a shed skin cell the property of the person whose DNA is within the cell, or have they given up their ownership? And what exactly constitutes informed consent?I thought it was a fascinating read, and while it appealed to my Science background by explaining the advances made, and the complications that arose, it also brought to light the bittersweet story of the family that thought they had lost their mother, and never knew that a little piece of her still existed until years after her death.A powerful read I'd recommend to everyone."
446,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101060033-woman-reading,4,"In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (ILHL), Skloot blends the Lacks' family history with that of medical sciences and all against a backdrop of systemic racism. For decades, her cell line, named HeLa, has far eclipsed the woman of their origin. Henrietta Lacks was born in 1920 as the ninth child of Eliza and Johnny Pleasant in Roanoke, Virginia. When Eliza died after birthing her tenth child in 1924, the family was divided amongst the larger network of relatives who pitched in to raise the children. Henrietta and David Lacks, her first cousin and future spouse, were raised together by their grandfather Tommy in a former slaves quarter cabin in Lacks Town (Clover), Virginia. Lacks Town had been the inheritance carved out of Henrietta's white great grandfather Albert Lacks' tobacco plantation in the late 1800s.From Skloot's interviews with relatives, Henrietta was a generously hospitable, hard working, and loving mother whose premature death led to enormous consequences for her children. Henrietta suspected a health problem a year before her fifth and last child was born. She went to Johns Hopkins, a renowned medical institution and a charity hospital, in Baltimore and received a diagnosis of cervical cancer in January 1951. (view spoiler)[Since cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, it seems likely that she had contracted the virus from her husband, who had not been monogamous. (hide spoiler)]During her first treatment for cancer, malignant cells were removed - without Henrietta's knowledge - and cultivated in a lab environment by Johns Hopkins researchers attempting to uncover cancer's secrets. Although the brachytherapy with radium was initially deemed a success, Henrietta's brown skin turned black as the cancer aggressively metastasized. After several weeks of great pain, Henrietta died in October 1951.ILHL raises questions about the extent to which we own our bodies, informed consent, and ethics surrounding the research of anything human. The HeLa line was a rare scientific success as those malignant cells thrived in lab conditions and eventually became crucial to thousands of research projects. Skloot reported that in 2009, an average human body was worth anywhere from $10,000 to $150,000. In the case of John Moore who had leukemia, his cell line was valued in millions of dollars. To prevent human trafficking, it is illegal to sell human organs and tissues, but they can be donated while processing fees are assessed.As a charity hospital in the 1950s, segregated patient wards in Johns Hopkins were filled with African Americans whose tissue samples were regarded by researchers as ""payment."" One cannot ""donate"" what one doesn't know. The Lacks family discovered HeLa's existence 22 years after Henrietta died. They've struggled to pay their medical costs while biotechnology companies have reaped profits from cultivating and selling HeLa cells. In 1999, the Rand Corporation estimated that 307 million tissue samples from  178 million  people (almost 60 percent of the population) were stored in the US for research purposes. Although the US is nowhere close to definitively addressing the questions raised by ILHL , a little progress has been made. In 1974, the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects (the ""Common Rule"") required informed consent for federally funded research. The Common Rule was passed in response to egregious and inhumane experiments such as the Tuskegee Syphilis project and another scientist who wanted to know whether injecting people with HeLa would give them cancer. Note that this rule exempts privately funded research. In 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) made it illegal for health practitioners and insurers to make one's medical information public without their consent. This was after researchers had published medical information about the Lacks family. It should be evident that human tissues have long been monetized. One method of creating monopoly - like control has been to obtain a patent. As of 2005, the US has issued patents for about 20 percent of all known human genes. Myriad Genetics patented two genes - BRCA1 and BRCA2 - indicative of breast and ovarian cancer. In 2009 the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), on behalf of scientists, sued Myriad Genetics. In 2013, the US Supreme Court gave the victory to the ACLU and invalidated the patents, thus lowering future research costs and obliquely taking a step toward defining ownership of the human body."
447,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27117957-stephanie-anze,5,"Henrietta Lacks was a mother to four children and about to become one for the fifth time when she started to feel sick. After the birth of her son, she only grew sicker. At John Hopkins, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer and underwent treatment. Unfortunately, the cancer spread quickly and Henrietta died. Before her death, a sample of her cancerous tissue was taken and cultivated in the lab. Her cells grew at an unprecedated rate and became extremely valuable to the scientific realm. Called HeLa, Henrietta's cells were the first to reach ""immortality"". Her family did not know this information for several years. This is the story of the woman behind the cells.I began reading more non-fiction books last year and have since come across some amazing works. 'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' will join those ranks. Hands down, this is one of the best non-fiction books written. Broad-in-scope, thought-provocking, awe-inspiring and jaw-dropping, this book is the perfect marriage between science and human interest. Greatly researched and with much heart, the prose is magnificent. Henrietta Lacks was a poor tobacco farmer, descended from slaves. When she was diagnosed with cervical cancer, she did not particularly stand out but when her cancerous tissue was cultivated in the Hopkins lab, that was a different story. Until HeLa, scientists had not been able to produce a cell line that perdured. With HeLa cells, however, they hit the jackpot. Used in everything from the development of vaccines to genetic research and even to test out the effects of a nuclear bomb, the impact of these cells is immesurable. Just one problem, Henrietta did not give consent to give her cells and her family did not learn of just how important Henrietta was until many years after her death. About 50 miillion metric tons of HeLa cells have been produced to date, more than enough cells to populate a village full of Henriettas. While Henritta never travelled far form her home, her cells have been all over the world and even into outer space. They have been infected with several illnesses and combined with other cells. Odds are eah of us has, in some way, come in contact with HeLa.The way in which Skloot balances the science aspect with the human asprct of the book is done with finnesse. The HeLa cells are something impressive but more so is the woman behind them. Henrietta was strong, confident and resourceful. By all accounts, she faced her cancer diagnosis with sheer bravery and never stopped thinking about her family, even when she knew she would not survive. Its truly sad that for that Henriettas's cells did for the world, her heirs do not even know where the exact location of her grave is. What stood out for me most was the relationship that developed between Sloot and Deborah (Henrietta's daughter). Until Skloot, most were merely interested in the cells with Henrietta as an afterthought. I love that Skloot focused on Henrietta. Its time she gets the recognition that is way overdue.This work raises many questions. With the ""Tissue Issue"", consent and scientific progress are at a standstill. Henrietta's cells were taken without her knowledge or that of her family. The exact amount of money made off the HeLa cells is not known but its exorbitant. Her family never saw a cent and sadly struggle to pay their health insurance. Biological ownership is a tricky subject matter. The John Moore case was one of the cases that put it on the map and it has been a hot botton issue since. While there are some basic rules to follow, the gist is that once any tissue is ""abandoned"" at a hospital, it ceases to be property of the patient. Blood tests, biopsies and tissue taken from surgeries are property of the hospital and they have no obligation to let their patients know if and for what their tissues can be used. The scientific communty argues that to seek consent would lead to a decreased access to materials or have people seek financial gain. Personally, I find this troubling. The moral and ethical concerns are overwhelming and getting to an agreement between both parties is a battle. Scientific progress is important but at what cost? This is a book that will stay with me for a while. Its up there with 'The Radium Girls' (another great non-fiction work). Highly recommended!"
448,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher,2,"2.5 stars. I found the 1st 1/2 of this book fascinating and eagerly awaited to hear more of Henrietta's story. Henrietta was someone you couldn't help but root for and you were amazed to hear of her strength and perpetual optimism. The 2nd 1/2 of this book was tedious and annoying. The book started to drag and focus too much on the researcher's hardships, but mostly, I found Henrietta's family to be utterly unlikable. I kept thinking of that saying, ""I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you"". I felt much of the Lacks family, particularly Deborah and Joe (who changed his name to the long Z name), enjoyed being miserable. Despite being corrected again and again on their misbeliefs, they would resort right back to harboring on their anger/hatred/anxiousness over falsities. I felt their actions reflected a disregard for much of the advancements that came about from their mother's indirect contribution to medicine, but focused instead on a victim mentality and desire for monetary contribution - monetary contribution for something they had absolutely nothing to do with and had not worked for one iota.  As for the ethics surrounding Henrietta's cells being taken, be it right or wrong, she was not treated any differently than rich white patients were at that time when it came to taking cells/tissue without informed consent. In that sense, I don't think she was personally wronged in an intentional manner, though I think it's crazy what could be done without informed consent at that time. If you want to talk about who was wronged in an intentional manner, we'll talk about Elsie. Furthermore, I'm not completely convinced that some things were not explained to Henrietta regarding sampling cells. It was stated by Henrietta and the Lacks family time and again that they often came away with a poor understanding after speaking with MDs, yet they did not ask further questions or state their lack of understanding. Therefore, anytime it was exclaimed they were told ""nothing"", I had doubts. Henrietta's cells as they were taken, were of very little worth. It was the ingenuity of the people that used them that gave them their worth. Should Henrietta have received a modest compensation? Perhaps, it's muddled for me. Organ donors do not receive compensation (or their families). The reward is knowing you have saved other's lives. Should her children be entitled to compensation decades later for advancements that continue to be made 50 years after the cells were taken - cells that were not even from their own body? Definitely not. Is her family entitled to give permission for what can and cannot be done to Henrietta's cells? Absolutely not. Informed consent (which was not legally required at that time) is between the patient and the MD - what other family members wish is insignificant. The most interesting part of this story for me was easily Henrietta's story. Her childhood, the abuse of the time to the poor and minorities, the overt racist culture, and her strong optimistic nature that she maintained despite the world burning around her. The part that made the story a chore to finish was the ignorance that the family clung to despite being informed of truths, and the smallness with which they appreciated the lives that have been saved due to the awful cancer their mother acquired compared to the greatness with which they felt they deserved money as a result of research and ingenuity that they had never participated in, let alone understood. Azle - 7/16"
449,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt,5,"This remarkable story about how people live on sometimes in the material way just as much as in memory, about science, ethics, the search for a cure to a potentially deadly disease, well, it's unforgettable and unlike any other book because it wasn't just her cells that kept Henrietta alive after her death - it was her family, whose lives were transformed upon hearing of her story and the research done on cells taken without her consent. "
450,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"For a non-fiction book about science, this book is pretty interesting. Chapters about genes, cloning and cancer are juxtaposed with chapters about Henrietta's personal life and about the author's interactions with the Lacks family. I think this book would scare a lot of people about how privacy is dealt with as a legal issue in the medical community. The book is about Henrietta Lacks - a woman whose cells live on and on to be experimented with, cloned, put into space, blown up, used to make human-animal and human-plant hybrids, etc. The point of the book is that these cells were taken from her without her knowledge or consent. Today, no one in her family can afford medical care, even though their mother/grandmother's cells are stored by the billions in laboratories around the world. This brings up many interesting points in debates about what rights the medical community has to do procedures 'for the benefit of humankind' vs. the rights of the individual and patient. Do your cells and tissues belong to you? Do they still belong to you, even when removed from your body? It is surprising how fuzzy the laws still are on this issue. The book also touches a little bit on racism - Henrietta was black, and the doctors who took and distributed her cells were white. But racism isn't the main focus. I found this book fascinating - and cell research isn't really my forte. I recommend this book, even to people who generally don't read or like non-fiction."
451,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,5,I read this book back in 2013 just before I joined Goodreads. I found my review on Audible and decided to add it to Goodreads for my records.This is a well written non-fiction book that provides back ground information about unfair treatment of minorities by medical research. Cassandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin did a great job with the narration of the book. The story of Henrietta Lacks and her family is interesting and the discovery and care of the Hi La cells. One major item about the family is the lack of education that played a major role in their understanding and ability to control the situation. The book accomplishes its goal of promoting proper documentation of biological tissue research. It raises the question of ownership of our own tissues and whether or not we have proprietary rights to our bodies in situ or in vitro. This question needs to be answered NOW not in the future. The other teaching of the book was how important education is to each individual. This is an absolute must read book for everyone on this planet. 
452,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,3,"This was definitely much more than just your average popular science book. Never have a I read a non-fiction book that is so multi-faceted - science, superstition, ethics, family troubles, violence, estrangement, racism - what a cocktail! Full review soon."
453,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5447027-ayelet-waldman,5,Holy shit this book is awesome.
454,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"I blew through this fascinating audiobook, practically manufacturing housework to do so that I'd have an excuse to plug myself in (okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration; there was plenty of housework to do without my having to manufacture any). I would recommend this book to just about anyone seeking a great read -- even if you're usually more of a fiction person, this non-fiction book offers plenty of interesting characters and storylines as well as being informative and provocative in the way of non-fiction.Did you know that much of medical research (and the benefits we derive every day, including many routine vaccines and medications we take for granted) is dependent on a culture of human cells that continue to live and reproduce even after their original owner died in 1951? Well, I didn't. And I wouldn't have thought that this factoid would interest me particularly, not being much of a science person myself. But somehow, Rebecca Skloot was able to make the dynamics surrounding these cells not only comprehensible to me but intriguing (no small feat). Even more intriguing, though, was the story of the late human being behind these cells, Henrietta Lacks, who never knew that her cells had been taken for research. Henrietta's surviving children, tragically losing their mother at a young age to cervical cancer and raised in a poor and abusive environment, only learned about this later in life and never saw a penny of the proceeds.""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" contains several stories. There is the story of Henrietta, a poor young African American woman with incurable cervical cancer, and of her children struggling to grow up without her after her early death. There is the story of the doctor who decided to slice off pieces of her tumor just prior to her death without asking or even informing her, who then discovered that these cancerous cells were immortal. There is the story of the cells, which began to be mass-produced and distributed to researchers for a wide variety of interesting and often ground-breaking experiments. And there is the story of Rebecca Skloot, a journalist who was persistent and dogged in her efforts to win Henrietta's family's reluctant trust (after they had been duped by others attempting to capitalize on Henrietta) so that she could learn and tell their story.Henrietta's adult children in this book are colorful characters with their own stories who overcame some difficult situations, some more successfully than others. We also meet different doctors and researchers -- while some prove to be profiteers, others are truly dedicated to science for its own sake. The doctor who originally took Henrietta's tumor for research without her knowledge fell into the latter category, which is part of what makes this a three-dimensional book rather than a simplistic polemic. A product of his times, this 1950s doctor was less sensitive to the medical and research ethics which have since received more attention, particularly when it came to a poor African-American woman. Should you care if someone uses your body tissues for medical research without your consent? Before I began reading this book, my thought was, why the heck would I care? Assuming that these tissues need to be removed in any case, why not use them to do some good for science and for mankind? But Rebecca offers some anecdotes which complicate this question, and the irony running throughout the book is that Henrietta's descendants cannot afford decent medical care, even as the entire medical profession benefits from Henrietta's unwittingly donated cells.Even if you think you're not a science person, even if you think you're not a non-fiction person, I would recommend checking this book out."
455,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"On the threshold between medicine and ethics.This book talks about ethical and legal conflicts, historically raised by the discovery of immortal cells that changed medicine and patients life's for the better. It‘s an astonishing story you probably didn‘t hear about before:In 1951 a colored poor woman named Henrietta Lacks walked into the Hopkins University, where a doctor extracted cells from her large cervix tumor, that killed her briefly after. But as they discovered in the laboratory, those were anything but normal cells, but the first immortal human cells grown in culture. They are still alive today and were replicated to millions and spread to laboratories all over the world, though Lacks has been dead for more than sixty years. They called them HeLa cells and they were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. What interested me the most was the scientific and legal part of that book. Ultimately it‘s a question of property and if we have the right on our cells, once they leave our body, particularly if we don‘t know about it.First there is the problem with uninformed consent. Henrietta did not provide informed consent for her cells to be used, she didn‘t have knowledge. Beyond that people were later unknowingly injected with her tumor cells, for the purpose of medical research. The same was performed on healthy prisoners with their knowledge, though their free consent seems to be questionable. They developed tumors, sometimes killing them. Furthermore her autopsy report was later published in the book of a journalist, the family didn‘t knew about and didn‘t want to see published. The question is the violation of privacy rights.The second problem are genetic rights/non-rights. Her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later, and didn‘t fully approve of it‘s usage A big focus also are patents and profits for biologic material.Henrietta and her family were very poor and didn’t even have health insurance. They received zero profits, while her cells sell for multiple-millions until today.Very shocking are also racism claims. Because the cells were discovered in the 50, making public that white people were treated with cell stems of a black woman would have had a major impact. Additionally implications are made, that colored people were categorically abused, abducted, purposely infected and killed to perform medical experiments. The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications, but actual, valuable people and historic events.What I didn’t like just as much though, is how the story is told at times, jumping between characters and writing styles; sometimes loosing the silver lining. The writing is very simple and doesn’t at all feel factual. As a non fiction fan, I miss that at times but I guess that others appreciate it even more. It reads a lot like a novel, particularly since a lot of content is told through conversations. In conclusion a super interesting story I won’t forget quickly!"
456,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna,5,"What a wonderful book! It describes the life of Henrietta Lacks and her family, the origin of the HeLa cell line (the first human immortal cell line), the research conducted with these cells, and also the author’s research and interviews in unfolding this story.“I’ve tried to imagine how she’d feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. I’m pretty sure that she—like most of us—would be shocked to hear that there are trillions more of her cells growing in laboratories now than there ever were in her body.” "
457,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1295401-diane-chamberlain,5,"Can't wait to recommend this book to my bookclub. It will make for a fabulous discussion. This book can satisfy several audiences on several different levels. The technical information about the science of cells is fascinating. The ethical questions raised by the unauthorized use of someone's cells are important to ask and ponder. But most fascinating is the story of the Lacks family. Skloot's exhaustive research spanned a decade and she tells a story that is honest, heart wrenching and provocative. "
458,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl,5,"This is one stellar piece of nonfiction that has a bit of everything in it for everybody. Beautifully written and structured because it is clear that while there's SOoo much information here, it is arranged in such a way that you don't get lost. Sure the author is a science writer, but she's also a creative nonfiction writer so the book doesn't read like a nonfiction textbook, and has the plot structure of fiction. Some chapters tell the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family, others take you on the research journey with Rebecca Skloot. The interactions she has with the family makes for light, sometimes humorous reading. In fact, the chronology is done in a way to make the book more interesting. The book is as much about family, as it is about science, history, racial tensions, and of one extraordinary black woman who has done more for medical research and advancements, than anything or anyone the industry has seen. It will have you crying, laughing, yelling at people...you name it. Born in 1920, Henrietta Lacks was thirty years old when she went to see a doctor for ""spotting"" and pain, and started getting treatments for cervical cancer (mind you, in the ""colored"" wards of John Hopkins. This was during the Jim Crow era). The researcher/doctor who treated her, collected samples of her cells (without her knowledge) while he placed radium inside of her. She soon deteriorated and each time she went in for treatment, her cells were taken and stored. Yet she knew nothing of the cells growing in a lab, or the fact that she was now infertile because of her cancer treatment. When she died, her husband signed paperwork to have an autopsy performed, because he was under the impression that doctors would find out if his children were predisposed to whatever his wife had, not knowing that his signature allowed his wife's body to be cut open to help with more research.This is the breadth of the story I think. A story about an African-American woman whose life and death seemed to be an irony--she wasn't allowed to mention her white, slave-owning family, yet she was buried next to them. She wasn't allowed to use the ""white-only"" medical facilities, yet her cells were mixed with white cells. In science cell culture, there were no other cells with the ability to multiply and stay immortal like hers. So every major medical breakthrough, like polio vaccine for example, came from the usage of her cells. The main thrust is, she didn't know. Her family didn't know, and they didn't find out until twenty years later because the name Henrietta Lacks was hidden by the doctors who used her cells as research. Scientists made millions from her body and her family had tons of health issues, with no help from their mother's cells and no health insurance. ""A search of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database turns up more than seventeen thousand patents involving HeLa Cells,"" Skloot wrote. But Henrietta's son Lawrence wanted to know, ""She's the most important woman in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""There they were, at a time when the country was learning about the ""Tuskegee Syphilis Study"" (where African-American men with syphilis were recruited for research, then made to die slow, painful deaths even after their researchers realized that penicillin would cure them), and cells from a black woman was being used to save millions of Americans, mostly white.In this book, Skloot brings the woman behind the cells to life, talks about her life, her troubled marriage, her children. She develops a relationship with Deborah, Henrietta's daughter who suffered the most from all of it. She talks to scientists and researchers. She brings in history. She talks about race tensions and shows how when slavery was abolished, African-Americans became slaves to another master: medicine. I'll admit, at times it was an emotional roller coaster for me, but one quote from Deborah stood out for me and should for you:""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different.""So anybody should be able to read this book because the way in which it is written, is not to point fingers (not even at the medical industry because the author manages to explain those times as well) but to glean the truth. To finally give credit where credit is due, and to educate. To honor a woman, a mother, a wife, whose body makes it possible for us to get some of the modern medical treatments that we get today. This is one book I will remember, that's for sure! "
459,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon,4,"In 1951, Henrietta Lacks passed away due to complications arising from cervical cancer. Following her death, cancerous cells were harvested from her body and used in ongoing experiments regarding the growth of cells outside the human body. Previous to Henrietta, scientists could only make it a few days before the cells would ultimately die, forcing them to start all over. Henrietta’s cells were different, they grew at an astounding rate and researchers were able to keep them alive. Since the discovery, they've been used in countless experiments and led to numerous scientific breakthroughs - most notably the polio vaccine.Today, Henrietta’s cells usually go for a few hundred dollars a vial but her descendants live in poverty. While many of her children believe they should be compensated for the sale of HeLa cells, court cases involving similar claims have always found in favor of research companies rather than individuals - the argument being that once a procedure is performed and tissue is removed from a body, it is no longer of use to the individual and the hospital can do with it as it pleases, be it incineration or study. On one hand, it makes sense given that it was highly doubtful Henrietta’s husband could have opened a cellular research facility, however, the problem lies within the fact that researchers did not tell Henrietta’s family about the importance of HeLa cells and lied to her children when additional bloodwork was requested for further study.The story of the Lacks family is a heartbreaking one. Henrietta had a terrible upbringing and following her death, things became that much worse for her children. While the book mainly concentrates on the HeLa cells, there’s a shocking piece on her daughter Elsie, who had been diagnosed with “idiocy” and institutionalized at Crownsville Hospital Centre (a.k.a. The Hospital for the Negro Insane) following her mother’s death. The conditions at the time of Elsie’s arrival were deplorable. They had a total of eight attendants (four in the day, four in the evening) for five hundred and sixty patients. One ward in particular had seventy eight patients with only twenty eight beds. There were also only three toilets to share amongst them all. You can imagine how much this upset the family when they found out decades later.While The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks can be deeply upsetting, it is without a doubt an important book. Author Rebecca Skloot spent years interviewing the Lacks family (which at times was certainly no easy task) and researching Henrietta’s life and death, all information that had been buried over time. The story flows well and her afterword provides greater insight into the legal ramifications of future soft tissue research. Henrietta’s youngest daughter Deborah always wanted the world to know about the person behind the HeLa cells, the real human being who provided the ammunition for several medical discoveries. Thanks to Rebecca’s tireless work, Henrietta Lacks' incredible true story is out there for the world to see.Also posted @ Every Read Thing."

Some people comment on the human interest aspect of the story with regard to the Lacks family. Other people mention the cell science. For me, the most interesting thing was the history of informed consent, or the ""Lacks"" thereof. (Go ahead and laugh now at my clever wordplay. You know you want to.)It's hard to believe the bizarre ways people's bodies were used for medical research, with or without their consent. Even when they did give consent, they did so without being told exactly what would be done to their bodies. Too often the people used for the studies were the poor, the uneducated, and prison inmates. Back in the forties and fifties, ""Many scientists believed that since patients were treated for free in the public wards, it was fair to use them as research subjects as a form of payment."" YIKES! That's not just unethical, it's abominable.Rebecca Skloot's dedication to the research and writing of this story is remarkable. She spent pretty much the entire decade of her twenties in pursuit of the truth about Henrietta Lacks and her ""immortal"" cells. My only reason for not awarding the full five stars is that I thought the book could have used one more ruthless edit before final printing. "

Clearly, a result of hard work and intense research and, above all the fact that the author has taken student loans and used her credit cards for the research work and had no other backing or support.

466,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66292681-sarah-lumos,4,"  “Henrietta’s (cells) were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.”  Argh, I feel embarrassed admitting this, but before reading this book, I had no idea what the HeLa cells were. I never studied science in-depth, which is now one of my biggest regrets. However, I guess in some ways I was lucky: I got to know who Henrietta Lacks was before meeting her famous cells. In this well-researched biography, Rebecca Skloot tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, a poor Black woman who was only 31 when she died from cervical cancer. While she was getting treatments at John Hopkins Hospital, Dr. George Guy took cells from Lack’s tumor without her consent. After examining her cells, Guy felt amazed. He realized her cells were unlike any he had seen - Henrietta’s cells refused to die.HeLa would become the first immortal cell line grown in a lab. For scientists, this discovery was monumental. It would allow them to conduct experiments they never could before. Henrietta’s cells would later help create in vitro fertilization, polio vaccines, and cancer treatments. Although HeLa cells have affected each of us in different ways, before this book’s publication, most of us had little to no idea who Henrietta Lacks was.Here is what I found riveting: Henrietta never graduated from high school, yet she became one of the most important people in science. Sure, science has its own explanation for how this happened, but her family believed God chose Henrietta. God wanted her to come back to Earth in the form of her cells to help others. Since the Lacks had a weak science background, faith was their way of understanding what happened to Henrietta, and making sense of the non-sensical. Though most of the Lacks were happy Henrietta’s cells were advancing science, some of them were mad. The Lacks had no science education, and scientists never bothered to explain to them what happened to Henrietta in a simple way. Researchers exploited their ignorance and the Lacks were never able to give informed consent. Their frustrations are understandable. I felt like giving each of them a hug when I read these passages. If I were them, I would be upset too. While HeLa cells were becoming a multi-million dollar industry, the Lacks were living in poverty, barely able to afford health insurance:   “...the last thing he remembered before falling into unconsciousness under anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened to medicine. Sonny woke up more than $125,000 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery.”  I also admire Skloot's grit because this was a massive project to undertake. I can understand why this book took her a decade to write. I think she wanted to do Henrietta's story justice, and she did. Skloot made sure the world knew about the Lacks and what they did for science. Furthermore, I liked that Skloot’s discussed the social determinants of health. Her clear prose helped me better understand patient rights, inequalities in medicine, informed consent, and tissue ownership laws. Overall, “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" was a magnificent treat. I am positive other readers will find this book as informative and awe-inspiring as I did."
467,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Skloot delivers a mix of science history and human interest in her journalistic style. She discusses medical ethics particularly the issue of informed consent as she tells the story of Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta was a poor black woman who joined the great migration of the 1940’s moving from rural southern Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. She was treated for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins, the only nearby hospital that would admit blacks in 1951. After suffering through the then standard radium therapy, she died that same year. Samples of her tumor were removed and became the first successful human cell culture to sustain itself. Known as HeLa her cells live on today in labs around the world the subject of endless experimentation. Most of the book is spent on Henrietta’s life, her daughter Deborah, their families and extended relations as well as the author’s work with the family to research the book. We follow Henrietta from her childhood in the 1920’s growing up in former slave quarters on the wrong side of the tracks in the small tobacco country town of Clover, Virginia. Skloot gives a somewhat romanticized version of what must have been a harsh life of poverty and discrimination. Similarly Skloot tries to bring out the positives while dutifully reporting the difficult lives of Henrietta’s descendants who suffer from chronic mental and physical illnesses, limited education and continued discrimination in the Baltimore area. Particularly interesting to me was the communication gap between the scientists and Henrietta’s working class African American family. A big part of the problem was the history of exploitation of African Americans by white doctors and their medical institutions. This history had been internalized into a pervasive distrust of doctors and hospitals by Henrietta’s family. Henrietta’s and her family’s fear is understandable and it struck me as part of a broader issue. With unarmed black men dying regularly at the hands of the police, we see similar fears by African Americans today. Skloot points out that scientific progress was made from practices that now would be clearly unethical. Henrietta’s cells sped up the development of the Polio vaccine in the early 1950’s saving many from this devastating disease. Concepts such as informed consent did not exist in 1951. Even today the issue is very murky which the author addresses in her afterword. At the end of the book Skloot returns to Clover to find it gone. All the ramshackle old buildings torn down, just empty fields remaining. Most of those who knew Henrietta had now passed on too. Only her cells remain, thriving in labs everywhere and generating the ground breaking medical discoveries of a new era. "
468,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2528841-claire,5,"In the same way we sometimes debate whether the story should be seen as an entirely seperate entity to the writer, so too do scientists perceive a sample of cell tissue as seperate to the human body it was extracted from. Except that it is not possible to extract a story from a writer's imagination without their consent. Henrietta Lacks was a young mother in her early thirties when she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer that would quickly take her life. She was fortunate to live close to the John Hopkins hospital, set up to ensure equal access to medical care for all' no matter their race, status, income or any other characteristic that might have otherwise given cause to discriminate.Before undergoing treatment, one of the Doctors took a tissue sample of her healthy cells and the cancerous cells, as he had been doing to most patients, in an effort to try and find cells that would continue to replicate without dying - the elusive ""immortal"" cell. It had never been done successfully with human cells before.He succeeded and the cells became known the world over as he gave them away freely, known as HeLa cells, the immortal human cells that never died and could be used over and over again to test for cures to disease and to observe how cells react to numerous variables, furthering science in ways unimaginable previously. Few paused to ask who the woman behind these cells was, what was her story, how did her family feel about this multi million dollar research industry that was making great strides in science yes, and also making entrepreneurial types wealthy in the process.Rebecca Skloot made Henrietta the subject of her research for 10 years in the creation of this thorough, respectful account of the life of Henrietta Lacks and her journey to uncover the events of the time within the context of what was the norm in her day. In much of it she is accompanied by Henriettas daughter Deborah, a passionate woman who was unable to find peace in her own life, until she had helped bring her mother's story to light.A brilliant and informative story and piece of scientific medical history that reads like a novel and brings our awareness to the many who unknowingly make sacrifices for the better of others and that always present aspect of those hovering in the wings, recognising an opportunity to profit."

The votes have been in for years: author Rebecca Skloot’s book racked up 19 significant awards and citations in 2010 when it was first published. The 2011 trade paperback edition I read boasts five pages of exuberant blurbs before you even get to the title page. I wanted to be a curmudgeon about it, but the story is so serious that I had to relinquish my pissy attitude. It is just that type of story: a sensational true crime story with ramifications in the fields of health and science; race and sociology; ethics, history, and journalism. Suspenseful, cinematic, and factual, Ms. Skloot manages to pack it all inside of 310 pages, with 71 pages remaining for appendices, acknowledgements, notes, and discussion group questions! She writes knowledgeably, intelligently, compassionately, and skillfully. This book is all that! The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family. It is about the miraculous and immortal cells---taken from her cervix without her permission in 1951 and how they have been serving medical research ever since. It is a story about her daughter, Deborah, and a science journalist (Rebecca Skloot) dedicating years of her life to questioning, investigating, researching, and writing. It is about injustice and justice; human liberties, and privileging science over human life and the right to make informed decisions. This book chillingly illustrates the complex path of ethics and medical research in the United States from the 1950s to the present. It made me mad, but it also educated me in a profound way."

In fact this is the first book to keep me so intellectually and emotionally engaged in a very long time. I struggle to find the words to express what it meant to read about the plight of this woman and the medical knowledge gained from her cells. To read this book is to begin to understand the impact of these cells on modern medicine. Then the book takes you further to read about what has happened to her family during these medical breakthroughs, the impact of what happened and its influences on the laws and the practice of medicine. Just an amazing book with so many elements intertwined and presented with such empathy and beauty. As a brief aside, shortly after I finished the book I had a minor medical procedure performed. Before they would begin, the patient must sign a medical release form and on the form was a statement asking the patient to relinquish all rights of ownership to any tissue samples removed. After reading this book I understand the implications (signed it, but was much more aware of the rationale behind it). This was a life affecting book for me. I didn't close the book thinking that I knew the answers to the ethical questions it raised. What I did feel was that it just seemed some how unjust that her family fared so poorly when her cells were so vital to so many of the scientific advancements made after her death. It presented legal and ethical quandaries that some of the finest legal minds still haven't wrapped their minds around. Engaging and enlightening book? And how!! Highly recommended!!!"

As someone who is strongly considering donating my body to science when I die, this was a probative read to think about the changing ethics of medicine, and a reminder that so much scientific development has been done on unwilling, non-consenting, and uninformed individuals. Top among these unwitting contributors, must rank Henrietta Lacks, whose indomitable cancer cells have led to inestimable developments. Though the ethics have tissue collection has drastically changed since the 1950s, it is surprising how much of a wild, wild west this area remains.

“Everybody in the world got her cells, only thing we got of our mother is just them medical records and her Bible.”
In 1951 doctors at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore diagnosed an unusually extreme case of cervical cancer. The breakneck growth rate and resistance to common remedies were unlike anything previously seen. Without informed consent, the doctor scraped a clump of cells from the cancerous tumor during one of the 30 year-old woman’s visits and deposited them with a nearby cell culture lab operated by George Gey. There, in the air-controlled space of Gey’s facility, something happened that researchers had long suspected out of reach. Where countless other cells before them had died, hers survived, and multiplied indefinitely. The immortality of this one cell line would prove instrumental in treating a number of the world’s most heavy-hitting diseases and set the stage for an all new era in cell research, medical diagnosis, drug development and bioethics. But this is a story not just about bundles of cells, but about the humanity behind them, and in particular the family to which they will forever be tied.That woman was Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta passed away just nine months after diagnosis, but it would be more than two decades before her family received word of the namesake cell line which survived her—HeLa. Its value as a scientific and commercial commodity was paramount, getting bogged down in the thicket of rights and privacy less so. Once researchers discovered that Henrietta’s cells did not die but instead bred a new generation every twenty-four hours, HeLa quickly became the tireless workhorse of the culture community. Vials were trucked to research facilities around the world, where they were regularly exposed to a pavilion of infectious diseases, merged with non-human DNA, and even shot into space in an effort to study the influence of zero gravity.Over time, details about the parent of the eponymous cells funneled out of view. Henrietta’s own kin were oblivious to the fact that her cells lived, were being studied and tested in dozens of countries, and were being exchanged at great profit. Once the unwitting donor’s official name was released, journalists descended in full fervor, leading to a lifetime of turmoil and unrest for the Lacks household. Set against the rich legacy of the family’s cells, their life of poverty and unpaid medical bills seemed untoward by comparison, and this sense of injustice only mounted as more details filtered in from the press.Rebecca Skloot’s segue into this lush narrative was by and large a product of serendipitous circumstance, having first heard of HeLa in an intro to biology course at her local community college. After learning that these cells had lived outside their host's body for the better part of a century, and about the remarkable advances they have gifted to science, Skloot shot up her hand and innocently asked, ""Who was she?"" The professor's reply proved unsatisfying: ""An African American woman."" The seed of curiosity had been planted. By the time Skloot graduated she'd decided to write a book to recover the disremembered woman whose cells had won so many victories for science and society.Who Was Henrietta Lacks?For more than a decade, Skloot layered herself into the Lacks’ story, befriending and forming deep bonds with Henrietta’s children and cousinry. She forges an especially strong connection with Deborah Lacks, Henrietta’s youngest daughter, who was unfortunately too young to remember much about her mother. With a mix of patience and persistence the two work together to dig up Henrietta’s heritage and bring to light her hitherto uncelebrated legacy. It is Skloot’s at times unstable relationship and camaraderie with Deborah that gives the narrative its steam, as the two probe ever deeper into the mystery surrounding her mother.Tracing the family’s roots places Henrietta’s childhood at the tail end of the Jim Crow era, a time when segregation meant a great deal more than which bathroom and water fountain one was required to use. Rampant legal disadvantages in the South bred systemic, institutionalized maladjustment for blacks, and this included limited access to medical care. Having spent her youth on a slave plantation in Clover, Virginia, Henrietta joined in the Great Migration at the ripened age of twenty-one, exchanging her familiarity with tobacco fields for a new life in Baltimore. Nine years later, she would be diagnosed with the malignancy that led to her iconic cell line. And it would be another fifty years before Deborah, with the help of Skloot, laid eyes on her mother’s original medical records.Johns Hopkins Hospital was founded for the express purpose of treating Baltimore's poor and, unlike today, informed consent upon providing blood or tissue samples was neither required by law nor common practice (the term did not even appear in a court document until 1957). Like everyone at the time, Henrietta hadn't a clue about what would become of her excised genetic material and the boons it would lavish upon the scientific community. This became a flashpoint issue in the years that followed as the occasional patient attempted to turn a gray area into a lucrative venture. While we learned more about DNA and transmissible disease, Henrietta's resilient cells inaugurated an international conversation on the commercialization of biological materials and where exactly the donors fit within that ecosystem. In many ways, the conversation is ongoing. (Skloot includes a superb summary in the afterword which draws together the various threads of this nuanced debate.) The HeLa LegacyTo properly gauge the vastitude of the legacy tied up in Henrietta’s cells, it’s important to understand 20th century cell culture. Until Henrietta came along, cell immortality was a pipe dream. While standard, non-cancerous cells had been grown in vitro since 1907, none of them survived long enough to endure important testing, petering out after 50 divisions, on average. Even cancer cells, like those common to cervical cancers, died shortly after relocation to the culture environment. This meant not only was there a brief window for experimentation but that a continuous supply of fresh cells was needed to sustain research. Many in the field yearned for a better way.HeLa keynoted a paradigm shift. They were robust enough to survive in the bricolage of materials used in Dr. Gey’s culture medium, and they were susceptible to the same range of infectious diseases as were normal cells. This allowed researchers to inject the lively DNA with diseases as well as cures. Not merely a boon to science, this revolutionized the field, so much so that one of the researchers Skloot interviews in the book, when asked what would happen if HeLa was pulled from research use, replied, “Restricting HeLa cell use would be disastrous. The impact that would have on science is inconceivable.” (p. 328)Thanks to Dr. Gey’s partnering efforts with labs around the globe, the benefits of HeLa manifested seemingly overnight. In just one year after HeLa’s genesis, Jonas Salk and his team were able to derive a vaccine for polio by infecting HeLa cells, followed shortly by drug treatments for HPV, herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia and Parkinson’s disease. In 1953 HeLa became the first cells to be cloned successfully. In total, some 60,000 papers have been published on HeLa, and cell culturists still use her cancer cells as a model for human biology.What was it exactly that gave HeLa cells their added dose of moxie? Even today, we can only speculate. We now know that Henrietta was infected with both HPV and syphilis, so one theory is that this virulent combination may have helped suppress PCD. A rival theory suggests she had highly atypical genes to begin with, perhaps a rare mutation, that enabled the cancer to spiral in unspecified directions. We still are uncertain. HeLa has also been the source of much frustration over the years from regularly contaminating other cell lines, often halting research until the botch-up is sorted.Closing ThoughtsRebecca Skloot’s ten-year effort is a literary and cultural marvel balanced between unsheathing the posthumous success and humanity behind one of the richest narratives in science and laying bare the bioethical implications to which it is attached. It succeeds on both fronts. Skloot is at her most animating when channeling the lens of Deborah Lacks as they band together to reach some much-needed closure to the saga thrust upon the Lacks family. With her first book, Skloot has demonstrated in equal measure her facility for conveying scientific nuance while weaving meaning and poetic force into a cohesive whole. Yes, this is first and foremost a work of nonfiction, but its pages are emblazoned with enough touches of novel-like charisma to beckon both crowds. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a timeless story delivered by a gifted writer and the definitive presentation of the legacy Henrietta never lived to see. Highly recommended.Skloot also founded The Henrietta Lacks Foundation - click here for more - to provide support for the Lacks as well as assistance to African Americans pursuing education in science and medicine. A portion of her book’s proceeds are donated to the Foundation.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."
475,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7983564-kaora,4,"A really powerful read about HeLa cells, taken without consent from a woman named Henrietta Lacks. Her cells contributed to many of modern medicines discoveries, including the polio vaccine and gene mapping, and yet her family is still so poor they cannot afford health care hacing seen none of the money generated by these cells.This book explores the debate about what makes up a person's body. Is a shed skin cell the property of the person whose DNA is within the cell, or have they given up their ownership? And what exactly constitutes informed consent?I thought it was a fascinating read, and while it appealed to my Science background by explaining the advances made, and the complications that arose, it also brought to light the bittersweet story of the family that thought they had lost their mother, and never knew that a little piece of her still existed until years after her death.A powerful read I'd recommend to everyone."
476,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101060033-woman-reading,4,"In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (ILHL), Skloot blends the Lacks' family history with that of medical sciences and all against a backdrop of systemic racism. For decades, her cell line, named HeLa, has far eclipsed the woman of their origin. Henrietta Lacks was born in 1920 as the ninth child of Eliza and Johnny Pleasant in Roanoke, Virginia. When Eliza died after birthing her tenth child in 1924, the family was divided amongst the larger network of relatives who pitched in to raise the children. Henrietta and David Lacks, her first cousin and future spouse, were raised together by their grandfather Tommy in a former slaves quarter cabin in Lacks Town (Clover), Virginia. Lacks Town had been the inheritance carved out of Henrietta's white great grandfather Albert Lacks' tobacco plantation in the late 1800s.From Skloot's interviews with relatives, Henrietta was a generously hospitable, hard working, and loving mother whose premature death led to enormous consequences for her children. Henrietta suspected a health problem a year before her fifth and last child was born. She went to Johns Hopkins, a renowned medical institution and a charity hospital, in Baltimore and received a diagnosis of cervical cancer in January 1951. (view spoiler)[Since cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, it seems likely that she had contracted the virus from her husband, who had not been monogamous. (hide spoiler)]During her first treatment for cancer, malignant cells were removed - without Henrietta's knowledge - and cultivated in a lab environment by Johns Hopkins researchers attempting to uncover cancer's secrets. Although the brachytherapy with radium was initially deemed a success, Henrietta's brown skin turned black as the cancer aggressively metastasized. After several weeks of great pain, Henrietta died in October 1951.ILHL raises questions about the extent to which we own our bodies, informed consent, and ethics surrounding the research of anything human. The HeLa line was a rare scientific success as those malignant cells thrived in lab conditions and eventually became crucial to thousands of research projects. Skloot reported that in 2009, an average human body was worth anywhere from $10,000 to $150,000. In the case of John Moore who had leukemia, his cell line was valued in millions of dollars. To prevent human trafficking, it is illegal to sell human organs and tissues, but they can be donated while processing fees are assessed.As a charity hospital in the 1950s, segregated patient wards in Johns Hopkins were filled with African Americans whose tissue samples were regarded by researchers as ""payment."" One cannot ""donate"" what one doesn't know. The Lacks family discovered HeLa's existence 22 years after Henrietta died. They've struggled to pay their medical costs while biotechnology companies have reaped profits from cultivating and selling HeLa cells. In 1999, the Rand Corporation estimated that 307 million tissue samples from  178 million  people (almost 60 percent of the population) were stored in the US for research purposes. Although the US is nowhere close to definitively addressing the questions raised by ILHL , a little progress has been made. In 1974, the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects (the ""Common Rule"") required informed consent for federally funded research. The Common Rule was passed in response to egregious and inhumane experiments such as the Tuskegee Syphilis project and another scientist who wanted to know whether injecting people with HeLa would give them cancer. Note that this rule exempts privately funded research. In 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) made it illegal for health practitioners and insurers to make one's medical information public without their consent. This was after researchers had published medical information about the Lacks family. It should be evident that human tissues have long been monetized. One method of creating monopoly - like control has been to obtain a patent. As of 2005, the US has issued patents for about 20 percent of all known human genes. Myriad Genetics patented two genes - BRCA1 and BRCA2 - indicative of breast and ovarian cancer. In 2009 the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), on behalf of scientists, sued Myriad Genetics. In 2013, the US Supreme Court gave the victory to the ACLU and invalidated the patents, thus lowering future research costs and obliquely taking a step toward defining ownership of the human body."
477,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27117957-stephanie-anze,5,"Henrietta Lacks was a mother to four children and about to become one for the fifth time when she started to feel sick. After the birth of her son, she only grew sicker. At John Hopkins, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer and underwent treatment. Unfortunately, the cancer spread quickly and Henrietta died. Before her death, a sample of her cancerous tissue was taken and cultivated in the lab. Her cells grew at an unprecedated rate and became extremely valuable to the scientific realm. Called HeLa, Henrietta's cells were the first to reach ""immortality"". Her family did not know this information for several years. This is the story of the woman behind the cells.I began reading more non-fiction books last year and have since come across some amazing works. 'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' will join those ranks. Hands down, this is one of the best non-fiction books written. Broad-in-scope, thought-provocking, awe-inspiring and jaw-dropping, this book is the perfect marriage between science and human interest. Greatly researched and with much heart, the prose is magnificent. Henrietta Lacks was a poor tobacco farmer, descended from slaves. When she was diagnosed with cervical cancer, she did not particularly stand out but when her cancerous tissue was cultivated in the Hopkins lab, that was a different story. Until HeLa, scientists had not been able to produce a cell line that perdured. With HeLa cells, however, they hit the jackpot. Used in everything from the development of vaccines to genetic research and even to test out the effects of a nuclear bomb, the impact of these cells is immesurable. Just one problem, Henrietta did not give consent to give her cells and her family did not learn of just how important Henrietta was until many years after her death. About 50 miillion metric tons of HeLa cells have been produced to date, more than enough cells to populate a village full of Henriettas. While Henritta never travelled far form her home, her cells have been all over the world and even into outer space. They have been infected with several illnesses and combined with other cells. Odds are eah of us has, in some way, come in contact with HeLa.The way in which Skloot balances the science aspect with the human asprct of the book is done with finnesse. The HeLa cells are something impressive but more so is the woman behind them. Henrietta was strong, confident and resourceful. By all accounts, she faced her cancer diagnosis with sheer bravery and never stopped thinking about her family, even when she knew she would not survive. Its truly sad that for that Henriettas's cells did for the world, her heirs do not even know where the exact location of her grave is. What stood out for me most was the relationship that developed between Sloot and Deborah (Henrietta's daughter). Until Skloot, most were merely interested in the cells with Henrietta as an afterthought. I love that Skloot focused on Henrietta. Its time she gets the recognition that is way overdue.This work raises many questions. With the ""Tissue Issue"", consent and scientific progress are at a standstill. Henrietta's cells were taken without her knowledge or that of her family. The exact amount of money made off the HeLa cells is not known but its exorbitant. Her family never saw a cent and sadly struggle to pay their health insurance. Biological ownership is a tricky subject matter. The John Moore case was one of the cases that put it on the map and it has been a hot botton issue since. While there are some basic rules to follow, the gist is that once any tissue is ""abandoned"" at a hospital, it ceases to be property of the patient. Blood tests, biopsies and tissue taken from surgeries are property of the hospital and they have no obligation to let their patients know if and for what their tissues can be used. The scientific communty argues that to seek consent would lead to a decreased access to materials or have people seek financial gain. Personally, I find this troubling. The moral and ethical concerns are overwhelming and getting to an agreement between both parties is a battle. Scientific progress is important but at what cost? This is a book that will stay with me for a while. Its up there with 'The Radium Girls' (another great non-fiction work). Highly recommended!"
478,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher,2,"2.5 stars. I found the 1st 1/2 of this book fascinating and eagerly awaited to hear more of Henrietta's story. Henrietta was someone you couldn't help but root for and you were amazed to hear of her strength and perpetual optimism. The 2nd 1/2 of this book was tedious and annoying. The book started to drag and focus too much on the researcher's hardships, but mostly, I found Henrietta's family to be utterly unlikable. I kept thinking of that saying, ""I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you"". I felt much of the Lacks family, particularly Deborah and Joe (who changed his name to the long Z name), enjoyed being miserable. Despite being corrected again and again on their misbeliefs, they would resort right back to harboring on their anger/hatred/anxiousness over falsities. I felt their actions reflected a disregard for much of the advancements that came about from their mother's indirect contribution to medicine, but focused instead on a victim mentality and desire for monetary contribution - monetary contribution for something they had absolutely nothing to do with and had not worked for one iota.  As for the ethics surrounding Henrietta's cells being taken, be it right or wrong, she was not treated any differently than rich white patients were at that time when it came to taking cells/tissue without informed consent. In that sense, I don't think she was personally wronged in an intentional manner, though I think it's crazy what could be done without informed consent at that time. If you want to talk about who was wronged in an intentional manner, we'll talk about Elsie. Furthermore, I'm not completely convinced that some things were not explained to Henrietta regarding sampling cells. It was stated by Henrietta and the Lacks family time and again that they often came away with a poor understanding after speaking with MDs, yet they did not ask further questions or state their lack of understanding. Therefore, anytime it was exclaimed they were told ""nothing"", I had doubts. Henrietta's cells as they were taken, were of very little worth. It was the ingenuity of the people that used them that gave them their worth. Should Henrietta have received a modest compensation? Perhaps, it's muddled for me. Organ donors do not receive compensation (or their families). The reward is knowing you have saved other's lives. Should her children be entitled to compensation decades later for advancements that continue to be made 50 years after the cells were taken - cells that were not even from their own body? Definitely not. Is her family entitled to give permission for what can and cannot be done to Henrietta's cells? Absolutely not. Informed consent (which was not legally required at that time) is between the patient and the MD - what other family members wish is insignificant. The most interesting part of this story for me was easily Henrietta's story. Her childhood, the abuse of the time to the poor and minorities, the overt racist culture, and her strong optimistic nature that she maintained despite the world burning around her. The part that made the story a chore to finish was the ignorance that the family clung to despite being informed of truths, and the smallness with which they appreciated the lives that have been saved due to the awful cancer their mother acquired compared to the greatness with which they felt they deserved money as a result of research and ingenuity that they had never participated in, let alone understood. Azle - 7/16"
479,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt,5,"This remarkable story about how people live on sometimes in the material way just as much as in memory, about science, ethics, the search for a cure to a potentially deadly disease, well, it's unforgettable and unlike any other book because it wasn't just her cells that kept Henrietta alive after her death - it was her family, whose lives were transformed upon hearing of her story and the research done on cells taken without her consent. "
480,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"For a non-fiction book about science, this book is pretty interesting. Chapters about genes, cloning and cancer are juxtaposed with chapters about Henrietta's personal life and about the author's interactions with the Lacks family. I think this book would scare a lot of people about how privacy is dealt with as a legal issue in the medical community. The book is about Henrietta Lacks - a woman whose cells live on and on to be experimented with, cloned, put into space, blown up, used to make human-animal and human-plant hybrids, etc. The point of the book is that these cells were taken from her without her knowledge or consent. Today, no one in her family can afford medical care, even though their mother/grandmother's cells are stored by the billions in laboratories around the world. This brings up many interesting points in debates about what rights the medical community has to do procedures 'for the benefit of humankind' vs. the rights of the individual and patient. Do your cells and tissues belong to you? Do they still belong to you, even when removed from your body? It is surprising how fuzzy the laws still are on this issue. The book also touches a little bit on racism - Henrietta was black, and the doctors who took and distributed her cells were white. But racism isn't the main focus. I found this book fascinating - and cell research isn't really my forte. I recommend this book, even to people who generally don't read or like non-fiction."
481,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,5,I read this book back in 2013 just before I joined Goodreads. I found my review on Audible and decided to add it to Goodreads for my records.This is a well written non-fiction book that provides back ground information about unfair treatment of minorities by medical research. Cassandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin did a great job with the narration of the book. The story of Henrietta Lacks and her family is interesting and the discovery and care of the Hi La cells. One major item about the family is the lack of education that played a major role in their understanding and ability to control the situation. The book accomplishes its goal of promoting proper documentation of biological tissue research. It raises the question of ownership of our own tissues and whether or not we have proprietary rights to our bodies in situ or in vitro. This question needs to be answered NOW not in the future. The other teaching of the book was how important education is to each individual. This is an absolute must read book for everyone on this planet. 
482,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,3,"This was definitely much more than just your average popular science book. Never have a I read a non-fiction book that is so multi-faceted - science, superstition, ethics, family troubles, violence, estrangement, racism - what a cocktail! Full review soon."
483,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5447027-ayelet-waldman,5,Holy shit this book is awesome.
484,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"I blew through this fascinating audiobook, practically manufacturing housework to do so that I'd have an excuse to plug myself in (okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration; there was plenty of housework to do without my having to manufacture any). I would recommend this book to just about anyone seeking a great read -- even if you're usually more of a fiction person, this non-fiction book offers plenty of interesting characters and storylines as well as being informative and provocative in the way of non-fiction.Did you know that much of medical research (and the benefits we derive every day, including many routine vaccines and medications we take for granted) is dependent on a culture of human cells that continue to live and reproduce even after their original owner died in 1951? Well, I didn't. And I wouldn't have thought that this factoid would interest me particularly, not being much of a science person myself. But somehow, Rebecca Skloot was able to make the dynamics surrounding these cells not only comprehensible to me but intriguing (no small feat). Even more intriguing, though, was the story of the late human being behind these cells, Henrietta Lacks, who never knew that her cells had been taken for research. Henrietta's surviving children, tragically losing their mother at a young age to cervical cancer and raised in a poor and abusive environment, only learned about this later in life and never saw a penny of the proceeds.""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" contains several stories. There is the story of Henrietta, a poor young African American woman with incurable cervical cancer, and of her children struggling to grow up without her after her early death. There is the story of the doctor who decided to slice off pieces of her tumor just prior to her death without asking or even informing her, who then discovered that these cancerous cells were immortal. There is the story of the cells, which began to be mass-produced and distributed to researchers for a wide variety of interesting and often ground-breaking experiments. And there is the story of Rebecca Skloot, a journalist who was persistent and dogged in her efforts to win Henrietta's family's reluctant trust (after they had been duped by others attempting to capitalize on Henrietta) so that she could learn and tell their story.Henrietta's adult children in this book are colorful characters with their own stories who overcame some difficult situations, some more successfully than others. We also meet different doctors and researchers -- while some prove to be profiteers, others are truly dedicated to science for its own sake. The doctor who originally took Henrietta's tumor for research without her knowledge fell into the latter category, which is part of what makes this a three-dimensional book rather than a simplistic polemic. A product of his times, this 1950s doctor was less sensitive to the medical and research ethics which have since received more attention, particularly when it came to a poor African-American woman. Should you care if someone uses your body tissues for medical research without your consent? Before I began reading this book, my thought was, why the heck would I care? Assuming that these tissues need to be removed in any case, why not use them to do some good for science and for mankind? But Rebecca offers some anecdotes which complicate this question, and the irony running throughout the book is that Henrietta's descendants cannot afford decent medical care, even as the entire medical profession benefits from Henrietta's unwittingly donated cells.Even if you think you're not a science person, even if you think you're not a non-fiction person, I would recommend checking this book out."
485,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"On the threshold between medicine and ethics.This book talks about ethical and legal conflicts, historically raised by the discovery of immortal cells that changed medicine and patients life's for the better. It‘s an astonishing story you probably didn‘t hear about before:In 1951 a colored poor woman named Henrietta Lacks walked into the Hopkins University, where a doctor extracted cells from her large cervix tumor, that killed her briefly after. But as they discovered in the laboratory, those were anything but normal cells, but the first immortal human cells grown in culture. They are still alive today and were replicated to millions and spread to laboratories all over the world, though Lacks has been dead for more than sixty years. They called them HeLa cells and they were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. What interested me the most was the scientific and legal part of that book. Ultimately it‘s a question of property and if we have the right on our cells, once they leave our body, particularly if we don‘t know about it.First there is the problem with uninformed consent. Henrietta did not provide informed consent for her cells to be used, she didn‘t have knowledge. Beyond that people were later unknowingly injected with her tumor cells, for the purpose of medical research. The same was performed on healthy prisoners with their knowledge, though their free consent seems to be questionable. They developed tumors, sometimes killing them. Furthermore her autopsy report was later published in the book of a journalist, the family didn‘t knew about and didn‘t want to see published. The question is the violation of privacy rights.The second problem are genetic rights/non-rights. Her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later, and didn‘t fully approve of it‘s usage A big focus also are patents and profits for biologic material.Henrietta and her family were very poor and didn’t even have health insurance. They received zero profits, while her cells sell for multiple-millions until today.Very shocking are also racism claims. Because the cells were discovered in the 50, making public that white people were treated with cell stems of a black woman would have had a major impact. Additionally implications are made, that colored people were categorically abused, abducted, purposely infected and killed to perform medical experiments. The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications, but actual, valuable people and historic events.What I didn’t like just as much though, is how the story is told at times, jumping between characters and writing styles; sometimes loosing the silver lining. The writing is very simple and doesn’t at all feel factual. As a non fiction fan, I miss that at times but I guess that others appreciate it even more. It reads a lot like a novel, particularly since a lot of content is told through conversations. In conclusion a super interesting story I won’t forget quickly!"
486,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna,5,"What a wonderful book! It describes the life of Henrietta Lacks and her family, the origin of the HeLa cell line (the first human immortal cell line), the research conducted with these cells, and also the author’s research and interviews in unfolding this story.“I’ve tried to imagine how she’d feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. I’m pretty sure that she—like most of us—would be shocked to hear that there are trillions more of her cells growing in laboratories now than there ever were in her body.” "

This book can satisfy several audiences on several different levels. The technical information about the science of cells is fascinating. The ethical questions raised by the unauthorized use of someone's cells are important to ask and ponder. But most fascinating is the story of the Lacks family. Skloot's exhaustive research spanned a decade and she tells a story that is honest, heart wrenching and provocative. "
488,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl,5,"This is one stellar piece of nonfiction that has a bit of everything in it for everybody. Beautifully written and structured because it is clear that while there's SOoo much information here, it is arranged in such a way that you don't get lost. Sure the author is a science writer, but she's also a creative nonfiction writer so the book doesn't read like a nonfiction textbook, and has the plot structure of fiction. Some chapters tell the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family, others take you on the research journey with Rebecca Skloot. The interactions she has with the family makes for light, sometimes humorous reading. In fact, the chronology is done in a way to make the book more interesting. The book is as much about family, as it is about science, history, racial tensions, and of one extraordinary black woman who has done more for medical research and advancements, than anything or anyone the industry has seen. It will have you crying, laughing, yelling at people...you name it. Born in 1920, Henrietta Lacks was thirty years old when she went to see a doctor for ""spotting"" and pain, and started getting treatments for cervical cancer (mind you, in the ""colored"" wards of John Hopkins. This was during the Jim Crow era). The researcher/doctor who treated her, collected samples of her cells (without her knowledge) while he placed radium inside of her. She soon deteriorated and each time she went in for treatment, her cells were taken and stored. Yet she knew nothing of the cells growing in a lab, or the fact that she was now infertile because of her cancer treatment. When she died, her husband signed paperwork to have an autopsy performed, because he was under the impression that doctors would find out if his children were predisposed to whatever his wife had, not knowing that his signature allowed his wife's body to be cut open to help with more research.This is the breadth of the story I think. A story about an African-American woman whose life and death seemed to be an irony--she wasn't allowed to mention her white, slave-owning family, yet she was buried next to them. She wasn't allowed to use the ""white-only"" medical facilities, yet her cells were mixed with white cells. In science cell culture, there were no other cells with the ability to multiply and stay immortal like hers. So every major medical breakthrough, like polio vaccine for example, came from the usage of her cells. The main thrust is, she didn't know. Her family didn't know, and they didn't find out until twenty years later because the name Henrietta Lacks was hidden by the doctors who used her cells as research. Scientists made millions from her body and her family had tons of health issues, with no help from their mother's cells and no health insurance. ""A search of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database turns up more than seventeen thousand patents involving HeLa Cells,"" Skloot wrote. But Henrietta's son Lawrence wanted to know, ""She's the most important woman in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""There they were, at a time when the country was learning about the ""Tuskegee Syphilis Study"" (where African-American men with syphilis were recruited for research, then made to die slow, painful deaths even after their researchers realized that penicillin would cure them), and cells from a black woman was being used to save millions of Americans, mostly white.In this book, Skloot brings the woman behind the cells to life, talks about her life, her troubled marriage, her children. She develops a relationship with Deborah, Henrietta's daughter who suffered the most from all of it. She talks to scientists and researchers. She brings in history. She talks about race tensions and shows how when slavery was abolished, African-Americans became slaves to another master: medicine. I'll admit, at times it was an emotional roller coaster for me, but one quote from Deborah stood out for me and should for you:""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different.""So anybody should be able to read this book because the way in which it is written, is not to point fingers (not even at the medical industry because the author manages to explain those times as well) but to glean the truth. To finally give credit where credit is due, and to educate. To honor a woman, a mother, a wife, whose body makes it possible for us to get some of the modern medical treatments that we get today. This is one book I will remember, that's for sure! "
489,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon,4,"In 1951, Henrietta Lacks passed away due to complications arising from cervical cancer. Following her death, cancerous cells were harvested from her body and used in ongoing experiments regarding the growth of cells outside the human body. Previous to Henrietta, scientists could only make it a few days before the cells would ultimately die, forcing them to start all over. Henrietta’s cells were different, they grew at an astounding rate and researchers were able to keep them alive. Since the discovery, they've been used in countless experiments and led to numerous scientific breakthroughs - most notably the polio vaccine.Today, Henrietta’s cells usually go for a few hundred dollars a vial but her descendants live in poverty. While many of her children believe they should be compensated for the sale of HeLa cells, court cases involving similar claims have always found in favor of research companies rather than individuals - the argument being that once a procedure is performed and tissue is removed from a body, it is no longer of use to the individual and the hospital can do with it as it pleases, be it incineration or study. On one hand, it makes sense given that it was highly doubtful Henrietta’s husband could have opened a cellular research facility, however, the problem lies within the fact that researchers did not tell Henrietta’s family about the importance of HeLa cells and lied to her children when additional bloodwork was requested for further study.The story of the Lacks family is a heartbreaking one. Henrietta had a terrible upbringing and following her death, things became that much worse for her children. While the book mainly concentrates on the HeLa cells, there’s a shocking piece on her daughter Elsie, who had been diagnosed with “idiocy” and institutionalized at Crownsville Hospital Centre (a.k.a. The Hospital for the Negro Insane) following her mother’s death. The conditions at the time of Elsie’s arrival were deplorable. They had a total of eight attendants (four in the day, four in the evening) for five hundred and sixty patients. One ward in particular had seventy eight patients with only twenty eight beds. There were also only three toilets to share amongst them all. You can imagine how much this upset the family when they found out decades later.While The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks can be deeply upsetting, it is without a doubt an important book. Author Rebecca Skloot spent years interviewing the Lacks family (which at times was certainly no easy task) and researching Henrietta’s life and death, all information that had been buried over time. The story flows well and her afterword provides greater insight into the legal ramifications of future soft tissue research. Henrietta’s youngest daughter Deborah always wanted the world to know about the person behind the HeLa cells, the real human being who provided the ammunition for several medical discoveries. Thanks to Rebecca’s tireless work, Henrietta Lacks' incredible true story is out there for the world to see.Also posted @ Every Read Thing."

Some people comment on the human interest aspect of the story with regard to the Lacks family. Other people mention the cell science. For me, the most interesting thing was the history of informed consent, or the ""Lacks"" thereof. (Go ahead and laugh now at my clever wordplay. You know you want to.)It's hard to believe the bizarre ways people's bodies were used for medical research, with or without their consent. Even when they did give consent, they did so without being told exactly what would be done to their bodies. Too often the people used for the studies were the poor, the uneducated, and prison inmates. Back in the forties and fifties, ""Many scientists believed that since patients were treated for free in the public wards, it was fair to use them as research subjects as a form of payment."" YIKES! That's not just unethical, it's abominable.Rebecca Skloot's dedication to the research and writing of this story is remarkable. She spent pretty much the entire decade of her twenties in pursuit of the truth about Henrietta Lacks and her ""immortal"" cells. My only reason for not awarding the full five stars is that I thought the book could have used one more ruthless edit before final printing. "

496,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66292681-sarah-lumos,4,"  “Henrietta’s (cells) were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.”  Argh, I feel embarrassed admitting this, but before reading this book, I had no idea what the HeLa cells were. I never studied science in-depth, which is now one of my biggest regrets. However, I guess in some ways I was lucky: I got to know who Henrietta Lacks was before meeting her famous cells. In this well-researched biography, Rebecca Skloot tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, a poor Black woman who was only 31 when she died from cervical cancer. While she was getting treatments at John Hopkins Hospital, Dr. George Guy took cells from Lack’s tumor without her consent. After examining her cells, Guy felt amazed. He realized her cells were unlike any he had seen - Henrietta’s cells refused to die.HeLa would become the first immortal cell line grown in a lab. For scientists, this discovery was monumental. It would allow them to conduct experiments they never could before. Henrietta’s cells would later help create in vitro fertilization, polio vaccines, and cancer treatments. Although HeLa cells have affected each of us in different ways, before this book’s publication, most of us had little to no idea who Henrietta Lacks was.Here is what I found riveting: Henrietta never graduated from high school, yet she became one of the most important people in science. Sure, science has its own explanation for how this happened, but her family believed God chose Henrietta. God wanted her to come back to Earth in the form of her cells to help others. Since the Lacks had a weak science background, faith was their way of understanding what happened to Henrietta, and making sense of the non-sensical. Though most of the Lacks were happy Henrietta’s cells were advancing science, some of them were mad. The Lacks had no science education, and scientists never bothered to explain to them what happened to Henrietta in a simple way. Researchers exploited their ignorance and the Lacks were never able to give informed consent. Their frustrations are understandable. I felt like giving each of them a hug when I read these passages. If I were them, I would be upset too. While HeLa cells were becoming a multi-million dollar industry, the Lacks were living in poverty, barely able to afford health insurance:   “...the last thing he remembered before falling into unconsciousness under anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened to medicine. Sonny woke up more than $125,000 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery.”  I also admire Skloot's grit because this was a massive project to undertake. I can understand why this book took her a decade to write. I think she wanted to do Henrietta's story justice, and she did. Skloot made sure the world knew about the Lacks and what they did for science. Furthermore, I liked that Skloot’s discussed the social determinants of health. Her clear prose helped me better understand patient rights, inequalities in medicine, informed consent, and tissue ownership laws. Overall, “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" was a magnificent treat. I am positive other readers will find this book as informative and awe-inspiring as I did."
497,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Skloot delivers a mix of science history and human interest in her journalistic style. She discusses medical ethics particularly the issue of informed consent as she tells the story of Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta was a poor black woman who joined the great migration of the 1940’s moving from rural southern Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. She was treated for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins, the only nearby hospital that would admit blacks in 1951. After suffering through the then standard radium therapy, she died that same year. Samples of her tumor were removed and became the first successful human cell culture to sustain itself. Known as HeLa her cells live on today in labs around the world the subject of endless experimentation. Most of the book is spent on Henrietta’s life, her daughter Deborah, their families and extended relations as well as the author’s work with the family to research the book. We follow Henrietta from her childhood in the 1920’s growing up in former slave quarters on the wrong side of the tracks in the small tobacco country town of Clover, Virginia. Skloot gives a somewhat romanticized version of what must have been a harsh life of poverty and discrimination. Similarly Skloot tries to bring out the positives while dutifully reporting the difficult lives of Henrietta’s descendants who suffer from chronic mental and physical illnesses, limited education and continued discrimination in the Baltimore area. Particularly interesting to me was the communication gap between the scientists and Henrietta’s working class African American family. A big part of the problem was the history of exploitation of African Americans by white doctors and their medical institutions. This history had been internalized into a pervasive distrust of doctors and hospitals by Henrietta’s family. Henrietta’s and her family’s fear is understandable and it struck me as part of a broader issue. With unarmed black men dying regularly at the hands of the police, we see similar fears by African Americans today. Skloot points out that scientific progress was made from practices that now would be clearly unethical. Henrietta’s cells sped up the development of the Polio vaccine in the early 1950’s saving many from this devastating disease. Concepts such as informed consent did not exist in 1951. Even today the issue is very murky which the author addresses in her afterword. At the end of the book Skloot returns to Clover to find it gone. All the ramshackle old buildings torn down, just empty fields remaining. Most of those who knew Henrietta had now passed on too. Only her cells remain, thriving in labs everywhere and generating the ground breaking medical discoveries of a new era. "

Except that it is not possible to extract a story from a writer's imagination without their consent. Henrietta Lacks was a young mother in her early thirties when she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer that would quickly take her life. She was fortunate to live close to the John Hopkins hospital, set up to ensure equal access to medical care for all' no matter their race, status, income or any other characteristic that might have otherwise given cause to discriminate.Before undergoing treatment, one of the Doctors took a tissue sample of her healthy cells and the cancerous cells, as he had been doing to most patients, in an effort to try and find cells that would continue to replicate without dying - the elusive ""immortal"" cell. It had never been done successfully with human cells before.He succeeded and the cells became known the world over as he gave them away freely, known as HeLa cells, the immortal human cells that never died and could be used over and over again to test for cures to disease and to observe how cells react to numerous variables, furthering science in ways unimaginable previously. Few paused to ask who the woman behind these cells was, what was her story, how did her family feel about this multi million dollar research industry that was making great strides in science yes, and also making entrepreneurial types wealthy in the process.Rebecca Skloot made Henrietta the subject of her research for 10 years in the creation of this thorough, respectful account of the life of Henrietta Lacks and her journey to uncover the events of the time within the context of what was the norm in her day. In much of it she is accompanied by Henriettas daughter Deborah, a passionate woman who was unable to find peace in her own life, until she had helped bring her mother's story to light.A brilliant and informative story and piece of scientific medical history that reads like a novel and brings our awareness to the many who unknowingly make sacrifices for the better of others and that always present aspect of those hovering in the wings, recognising an opportunity to profit."

The votes have been in for years: author Rebecca Skloot’s book racked up 19 significant awards and citations in 2010 when it was first published. The 2011 trade paperback edition I read boasts five pages of exuberant blurbs before you even get to the title page. I wanted to be a curmudgeon about it, but the story is so serious that I had to relinquish my pissy attitude. It is just that type of story: a sensational true crime story with ramifications in the fields of health and science; race and sociology; ethics, history, and journalism. Suspenseful, cinematic, and factual, Ms. Skloot manages to pack it all inside of 310 pages, with 71 pages remaining for appendices, acknowledgements, notes, and discussion group questions! She writes knowledgeably, intelligently, compassionately, and skillfully. This book is all that! The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family. It is about the miraculous and immortal cells---taken from her cervix without her permission in 1951 and how they have been serving medical research ever since. It is a story about her daughter, Deborah, and a science journalist (Rebecca Skloot) dedicating years of her life to questioning, investigating, researching, and writing. It is about injustice and justice; human liberties, and privileging science over human life and the right to make informed decisions. This book chillingly illustrates the complex path of ethics and medical research in the United States from the 1950s to the present. It made me mad, but it also educated me in a profound way."

In fact this is the first book to keep me so intellectually and emotionally engaged in a very long time. I struggle to find the words to express what it meant to read about the plight of this woman and the medical knowledge gained from her cells. To read this book is to begin to understand the impact of these cells on modern medicine. Then the book takes you further to read about what has happened to her family during these medical breakthroughs, the impact of what happened and its influences on the laws and the practice of medicine. Just an amazing book with so many elements intertwined and presented with such empathy and beauty. As a brief aside, shortly after I finished the book I had a minor medical procedure performed. Before they would begin, the patient must sign a medical release form and on the form was a statement asking the patient to relinquish all rights of ownership to any tissue samples removed. After reading this book I understand the implications (signed it, but was much more aware of the rationale behind it). This was a life affecting book for me. I didn't close the book thinking that I knew the answers to the ethical questions it raised. What I did feel was that it just seemed some how unjust that her family fared so poorly when her cells were so vital to so many of the scientific advancements made after her death. It presented legal and ethical quandaries that some of the finest legal minds still haven't wrapped their minds around. Engaging and enlightening book? And how!! Highly recommended!!!"

As someone who is strongly considering donating my body to science when I die, this was a probative read to think about the changing ethics of medicine, and a reminder that so much scientific development has been done on unwilling, non-consenting, and uninformed individuals. Top among these unwitting contributors, must rank Henrietta Lacks, whose indomitable cancer cells have led to inestimable developments. Though the ethics have tissue collection has drastically changed since the 1950s, it is surprising how much of a wild, wild west this area remains.

“Everybody in the world got her cells, only thing we got of our mother is just them medical records and her Bible.”
In 1951 doctors at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore diagnosed an unusually extreme case of cervical cancer. The breakneck growth rate and resistance to common remedies were unlike anything previously seen. Without informed consent, the doctor scraped a clump of cells from the cancerous tumor during one of the 30 year-old woman’s visits and deposited them with a nearby cell culture lab operated by George Gey. There, in the air-controlled space of Gey’s facility, something happened that researchers had long suspected out of reach. Where countless other cells before them had died, hers survived, and multiplied indefinitely. The immortality of this one cell line would prove instrumental in treating a number of the world’s most heavy-hitting diseases and set the stage for an all new era in cell research, medical diagnosis, drug development and bioethics. But this is a story not just about bundles of cells, but about the humanity behind them, and in particular the family to which they will forever be tied.That woman was Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta passed away just nine months after diagnosis, but it would be more than two decades before her family received word of the namesake cell line which survived her—HeLa. Its value as a scientific and commercial commodity was paramount, getting bogged down in the thicket of rights and privacy less so. Once researchers discovered that Henrietta’s cells did not die but instead bred a new generation every twenty-four hours, HeLa quickly became the tireless workhorse of the culture community. Vials were trucked to research facilities around the world, where they were regularly exposed to a pavilion of infectious diseases, merged with non-human DNA, and even shot into space in an effort to study the influence of zero gravity.Over time, details about the parent of the eponymous cells funneled out of view. Henrietta’s own kin were oblivious to the fact that her cells lived, were being studied and tested in dozens of countries, and were being exchanged at great profit. Once the unwitting donor’s official name was released, journalists descended in full fervor, leading to a lifetime of turmoil and unrest for the Lacks household. Set against the rich legacy of the family’s cells, their life of poverty and unpaid medical bills seemed untoward by comparison, and this sense of injustice only mounted as more details filtered in from the press.Rebecca Skloot’s segue into this lush narrative was by and large a product of serendipitous circumstance, having first heard of HeLa in an intro to biology course at her local community college. After learning that these cells had lived outside their host's body for the better part of a century, and about the remarkable advances they have gifted to science, Skloot shot up her hand and innocently asked, ""Who was she?"" The professor's reply proved unsatisfying: ""An African American woman."" The seed of curiosity had been planted. By the time Skloot graduated she'd decided to write a book to recover the disremembered woman whose cells had won so many victories for science and society.Who Was Henrietta Lacks?For more than a decade, Skloot layered herself into the Lacks’ story, befriending and forming deep bonds with Henrietta’s children and cousinry. She forges an especially strong connection with Deborah Lacks, Henrietta’s youngest daughter, who was unfortunately too young to remember much about her mother. With a mix of patience and persistence the two work together to dig up Henrietta’s heritage and bring to light her hitherto uncelebrated legacy. It is Skloot’s at times unstable relationship and camaraderie with Deborah that gives the narrative its steam, as the two probe ever deeper into the mystery surrounding her mother.Tracing the family’s roots places Henrietta’s childhood at the tail end of the Jim Crow era, a time when segregation meant a great deal more than which bathroom and water fountain one was required to use. Rampant legal disadvantages in the South bred systemic, institutionalized maladjustment for blacks, and this included limited access to medical care. Having spent her youth on a slave plantation in Clover, Virginia, Henrietta joined in the Great Migration at the ripened age of twenty-one, exchanging her familiarity with tobacco fields for a new life in Baltimore. Nine years later, she would be diagnosed with the malignancy that led to her iconic cell line. And it would be another fifty years before Deborah, with the help of Skloot, laid eyes on her mother’s original medical records.Johns Hopkins Hospital was founded for the express purpose of treating Baltimore's poor and, unlike today, informed consent upon providing blood or tissue samples was neither required by law nor common practice (the term did not even appear in a court document until 1957). Like everyone at the time, Henrietta hadn't a clue about what would become of her excised genetic material and the boons it would lavish upon the scientific community. This became a flashpoint issue in the years that followed as the occasional patient attempted to turn a gray area into a lucrative venture. While we learned more about DNA and transmissible disease, Henrietta's resilient cells inaugurated an international conversation on the commercialization of biological materials and where exactly the donors fit within that ecosystem. In many ways, the conversation is ongoing. (Skloot includes a superb summary in the afterword which draws together the various threads of this nuanced debate.) The HeLa LegacyTo properly gauge the vastitude of the legacy tied up in Henrietta’s cells, it’s important to understand 20th century cell culture. Until Henrietta came along, cell immortality was a pipe dream. While standard, non-cancerous cells had been grown in vitro since 1907, none of them survived long enough to endure important testing, petering out after 50 divisions, on average. Even cancer cells, like those common to cervical cancers, died shortly after relocation to the culture environment. This meant not only was there a brief window for experimentation but that a continuous supply of fresh cells was needed to sustain research. Many in the field yearned for a better way.HeLa keynoted a paradigm shift. They were robust enough to survive in the bricolage of materials used in Dr. Gey’s culture medium, and they were susceptible to the same range of infectious diseases as were normal cells. This allowed researchers to inject the lively DNA with diseases as well as cures. Not merely a boon to science, this revolutionized the field, so much so that one of the researchers Skloot interviews in the book, when asked what would happen if HeLa was pulled from research use, replied, “Restricting HeLa cell use would be disastrous. The impact that would have on science is inconceivable.” (p. 328)Thanks to Dr. Gey’s partnering efforts with labs around the globe, the benefits of HeLa manifested seemingly overnight. In just one year after HeLa’s genesis, Jonas Salk and his team were able to derive a vaccine for polio by infecting HeLa cells, followed shortly by drug treatments for HPV, herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia and Parkinson’s disease. In 1953 HeLa became the first cells to be cloned successfully. In total, some 60,000 papers have been published on HeLa, and cell culturists still use her cancer cells as a model for human biology.What was it exactly that gave HeLa cells their added dose of moxie? Even today, we can only speculate. We now know that Henrietta was infected with both HPV and syphilis, so one theory is that this virulent combination may have helped suppress PCD. A rival theory suggests she had highly atypical genes to begin with, perhaps a rare mutation, that enabled the cancer to spiral in unspecified directions. We still are uncertain. HeLa has also been the source of much frustration over the years from regularly contaminating other cell lines, often halting research until the botch-up is sorted.Closing ThoughtsRebecca Skloot’s ten-year effort is a literary and cultural marvel balanced between unsheathing the posthumous success and humanity behind one of the richest narratives in science and laying bare the bioethical implications to which it is attached. It succeeds on both fronts. Skloot is at her most animating when channeling the lens of Deborah Lacks as they band together to reach some much-needed closure to the saga thrust upon the Lacks family. With her first book, Skloot has demonstrated in equal measure her facility for conveying scientific nuance while weaving meaning and poetic force into a cohesive whole. Yes, this is first and foremost a work of nonfiction, but its pages are emblazoned with enough touches of novel-like charisma to beckon both crowds. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a timeless story delivered by a gifted writer and the definitive presentation of the legacy Henrietta never lived to see. Highly recommended.Skloot also founded The Henrietta Lacks Foundation - click here for more - to provide support for the Lacks as well as assistance to African Americans pursuing education in science and medicine. A portion of her book’s proceeds are donated to the Foundation.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."
505,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7983564-kaora,4,"A really powerful read about HeLa cells, taken without consent from a woman named Henrietta Lacks. Her cells contributed to many of modern medicines discoveries, including the polio vaccine and gene mapping, and yet her family is still so poor they cannot afford health care hacing seen none of the money generated by these cells.This book explores the debate about what makes up a person's body. Is a shed skin cell the property of the person whose DNA is within the cell, or have they given up their ownership? And what exactly constitutes informed consent?I thought it was a fascinating read, and while it appealed to my Science background by explaining the advances made, and the complications that arose, it also brought to light the bittersweet story of the family that thought they had lost their mother, and never knew that a little piece of her still existed until years after her death.A powerful read I'd recommend to everyone."
506,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101060033-woman-reading,4,"In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (ILHL), Skloot blends the Lacks' family history with that of medical sciences and all against a backdrop of systemic racism. For decades, her cell line, named HeLa, has far eclipsed the woman of their origin. Henrietta Lacks was born in 1920 as the ninth child of Eliza and Johnny Pleasant in Roanoke, Virginia. When Eliza died after birthing her tenth child in 1924, the family was divided amongst the larger network of relatives who pitched in to raise the children. Henrietta and David Lacks, her first cousin and future spouse, were raised together by their grandfather Tommy in a former slaves quarter cabin in Lacks Town (Clover), Virginia. Lacks Town had been the inheritance carved out of Henrietta's white great grandfather Albert Lacks' tobacco plantation in the late 1800s.From Skloot's interviews with relatives, Henrietta was a generously hospitable, hard working, and loving mother whose premature death led to enormous consequences for her children. Henrietta suspected a health problem a year before her fifth and last child was born. She went to Johns Hopkins, a renowned medical institution and a charity hospital, in Baltimore and received a diagnosis of cervical cancer in January 1951. (view spoiler)[Since cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, it seems likely that she had contracted the virus from her husband, who had not been monogamous. (hide spoiler)]During her first treatment for cancer, malignant cells were removed - without Henrietta's knowledge - and cultivated in a lab environment by Johns Hopkins researchers attempting to uncover cancer's secrets. Although the brachytherapy with radium was initially deemed a success, Henrietta's brown skin turned black as the cancer aggressively metastasized. After several weeks of great pain, Henrietta died in October 1951.ILHL raises questions about the extent to which we own our bodies, informed consent, and ethics surrounding the research of anything human. The HeLa line was a rare scientific success as those malignant cells thrived in lab conditions and eventually became crucial to thousands of research projects. Skloot reported that in 2009, an average human body was worth anywhere from $10,000 to $150,000. In the case of John Moore who had leukemia, his cell line was valued in millions of dollars. To prevent human trafficking, it is illegal to sell human organs and tissues, but they can be donated while processing fees are assessed.As a charity hospital in the 1950s, segregated patient wards in Johns Hopkins were filled with African Americans whose tissue samples were regarded by researchers as ""payment."" One cannot ""donate"" what one doesn't know. The Lacks family discovered HeLa's existence 22 years after Henrietta died. They've struggled to pay their medical costs while biotechnology companies have reaped profits from cultivating and selling HeLa cells. In 1999, the Rand Corporation estimated that 307 million tissue samples from  178 million  people (almost 60 percent of the population) were stored in the US for research purposes. Although the US is nowhere close to definitively addressing the questions raised by ILHL , a little progress has been made. In 1974, the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects (the ""Common Rule"") required informed consent for federally funded research. The Common Rule was passed in response to egregious and inhumane experiments such as the Tuskegee Syphilis project and another scientist who wanted to know whether injecting people with HeLa would give them cancer. Note that this rule exempts privately funded research. In 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) made it illegal for health practitioners and insurers to make one's medical information public without their consent. This was after researchers had published medical information about the Lacks family. It should be evident that human tissues have long been monetized. One method of creating monopoly - like control has been to obtain a patent. As of 2005, the US has issued patents for about 20 percent of all known human genes. Myriad Genetics patented two genes - BRCA1 and BRCA2 - indicative of breast and ovarian cancer. In 2009 the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), on behalf of scientists, sued Myriad Genetics. In 2013, the US Supreme Court gave the victory to the ACLU and invalidated the patents, thus lowering future research costs and obliquely taking a step toward defining ownership of the human body."

After the birth of her son, she only grew sicker. At John Hopkins, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer and underwent treatment. Unfortunately, the cancer spread quickly and Henrietta died. Before her death, a sample of her cancerous tissue was taken and cultivated in the lab. Her cells grew at an unprecedated rate and became extremely valuable to the scientific realm. Called HeLa, Henrietta's cells were the first to reach ""immortality"". Her family did not know this information for several years. This is the story of the woman behind the cells.I began reading more non-fiction books last year and have since come across some amazing works. 'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' will join those ranks. Hands down, this is one of the best non-fiction books written. Broad-in-scope, thought-provocking, awe-inspiring and jaw-dropping, this book is the perfect marriage between science and human interest. Greatly researched and with much heart, the prose is magnificent. Henrietta Lacks was a poor tobacco farmer, descended from slaves. When she was diagnosed with cervical cancer, she did not particularly stand out but when her cancerous tissue was cultivated in the Hopkins lab, that was a different story. Until HeLa, scientists had not been able to produce a cell line that perdured. With HeLa cells, however, they hit the jackpot. Used in everything from the development of vaccines to genetic research and even to test out the effects of a nuclear bomb, the impact of these cells is immesurable. Just one problem, Henrietta did not give consent to give her cells and her family did not learn of just how important Henrietta was until many years after her death. About 50 miillion metric tons of HeLa cells have been produced to date, more than enough cells to populate a village full of Henriettas. While Henritta never travelled far form her home, her cells have been all over the world and even into outer space. They have been infected with several illnesses and combined with other cells. Odds are eah of us has, in some way, come in contact with HeLa.The way in which Skloot balances the science aspect with the human asprct of the book is done with finnesse. The HeLa cells are something impressive but more so is the woman behind them. Henrietta was strong, confident and resourceful. By all accounts, she faced her cancer diagnosis with sheer bravery and never stopped thinking about her family, even when she knew she would not survive. Its truly sad that for that Henriettas's cells did for the world, her heirs do not even know where the exact location of her grave is. What stood out for me most was the relationship that developed between Sloot and Deborah (Henrietta's daughter). Until Skloot, most were merely interested in the cells with Henrietta as an afterthought. I love that Skloot focused on Henrietta. Its time she gets the recognition that is way overdue.This work raises many questions. With the ""Tissue Issue"", consent and scientific progress are at a standstill. Henrietta's cells were taken without her knowledge or that of her family. The exact amount of money made off the HeLa cells is not known but its exorbitant. Her family never saw a cent and sadly struggle to pay their health insurance. Biological ownership is a tricky subject matter. The John Moore case was one of the cases that put it on the map and it has been a hot botton issue since. While there are some basic rules to follow, the gist is that once any tissue is ""abandoned"" at a hospital, it ceases to be property of the patient. Blood tests, biopsies and tissue taken from surgeries are property of the hospital and they have no obligation to let their patients know if and for what their tissues can be used. The scientific communty argues that to seek consent would lead to a decreased access to materials or have people seek financial gain. Personally, I find this troubling. The moral and ethical concerns are overwhelming and getting to an agreement between both parties is a battle. Scientific progress is important but at what cost? This is a book that will stay with me for a while. Its up there with 'The Radium Girls' (another great non-fiction work). Highly recommended!"
508,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher,2,"2.5 stars. I found the 1st 1/2 of this book fascinating and eagerly awaited to hear more of Henrietta's story. Henrietta was someone you couldn't help but root for and you were amazed to hear of her strength and perpetual optimism. The 2nd 1/2 of this book was tedious and annoying. The book started to drag and focus too much on the researcher's hardships, but mostly, I found Henrietta's family to be utterly unlikable. I kept thinking of that saying, ""I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you"". I felt much of the Lacks family, particularly Deborah and Joe (who changed his name to the long Z name), enjoyed being miserable. Despite being corrected again and again on their misbeliefs, they would resort right back to harboring on their anger/hatred/anxiousness over falsities. I felt their actions reflected a disregard for much of the advancements that came about from their mother's indirect contribution to medicine, but focused instead on a victim mentality and desire for monetary contribution - monetary contribution for something they had absolutely nothing to do with and had not worked for one iota.  As for the ethics surrounding Henrietta's cells being taken, be it right or wrong, she was not treated any differently than rich white patients were at that time when it came to taking cells/tissue without informed consent. In that sense, I don't think she was personally wronged in an intentional manner, though I think it's crazy what could be done without informed consent at that time. If you want to talk about who was wronged in an intentional manner, we'll talk about Elsie. Furthermore, I'm not completely convinced that some things were not explained to Henrietta regarding sampling cells. It was stated by Henrietta and the Lacks family time and again that they often came away with a poor understanding after speaking with MDs, yet they did not ask further questions or state their lack of understanding. Therefore, anytime it was exclaimed they were told ""nothing"", I had doubts. Henrietta's cells as they were taken, were of very little worth. It was the ingenuity of the people that used them that gave them their worth. Should Henrietta have received a modest compensation? Perhaps, it's muddled for me. Organ donors do not receive compensation (or their families). The reward is knowing you have saved other's lives. Should her children be entitled to compensation decades later for advancements that continue to be made 50 years after the cells were taken - cells that were not even from their own body? Definitely not. Is her family entitled to give permission for what can and cannot be done to Henrietta's cells? Absolutely not. Informed consent (which was not legally required at that time) is between the patient and the MD - what other family members wish is insignificant. The most interesting part of this story for me was easily Henrietta's story. Her childhood, the abuse of the time to the poor and minorities, the overt racist culture, and her strong optimistic nature that she maintained despite the world burning around her. The part that made the story a chore to finish was the ignorance that the family clung to despite being informed of truths, and the smallness with which they appreciated the lives that have been saved due to the awful cancer their mother acquired compared to the greatness with which they felt they deserved money as a result of research and ingenuity that they had never participated in, let alone understood.

The cells cut from her body, because of their aptitude for growth and replication, still play a significant role in treating disease and other medical tests. She did not know her cells were being used, and her family did not benefit financially. The author writes extensively about her family, as they were a crucial source for the book. Because of so many trust relationships violated over the years, she had to first work to build trust and prove herself reliable. She went on to establish a trust for the family.This book discusses science, both the present state of medicine while Henrietta was being treated for cervical cancer (nothing short of radium tube inserts and lead!) and how science has grown in its understandings and treatments because of her cells. The book has to address the ways African Americans have been treated badly by the American medical establishment from Tuskagee to forced sterilizations, to even some patients injected with Henrietta's cells without their knowledge! I felt like I knew much of the story already, but only because this book has received so much acclaim and press, and I find rightly so. I'm not a scientist but felt I could understand it as Skloot presented the information.I also learned some terrifying things that don't soothe my paranoia. Huge government stores of cells that no longer belong to you - not owning the rights to your bodily tissue - still all true in the 21st century. Ever wonder where your blood, teeth, etc. got to? Ha. I read this during Banned Books Week 2015 because earlier this year it was challenged by a Tennessee mother who felt it was ""pornographic.""

It couldn't decide if it was a history of the cells, the life story of one woman, a chronicle of how an author tracks down the life story of a woman, a position paper on racism, a position paper on human tissue ownership, or a position paper on disorganized rhetoric. I think it was all of those, and it drove me absolutely up the wall.As a history of the HeLa cells ... I read a Wired article that was better.As the life story of Henrietta Lacks ... it read like a list of facts instead of a human interest piece. And it kept going on tangents (with the life stories of each of her children, her doctors, etc.)As the story of the author tracking down a story ... that was actually kind of interesting.As a position paper on racism...it had a lot of disturbing stories - but no cohesive point.As a position paper on human tissue ownership... the best chapter was the last one, which actually listed facts and laws. And while the author clearly had an opinion in that chapter -it was more focused and less full of unrelated stories intended to pull on your hearts strings and shift your opinion.As a position paper on disorganized rhetoric...it was a stellar exemplar."
512,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"I don't know how many copies of a book need to be sold before it can be fairly described as a best-seller. In any case what kind of bearing does the number of copies sold have on the amount that a book is read? The success of Rebecca Skloot's book is maybe entirely unsurprising as it covers a wide range of angles and caters for many tastes. It has something of the ever popular misery mémoire, some social history, an investigative aspect with detective road trips, along with an exploration of one of the wonders of modern science. All of this comes together in two alternating narrative strands, the death of Henrietta Lacks from cancer and the strange ongoing life and use of a tissue sample collected from her that has been used for a host of purposes from cancer research to gene mapping to assessing human sensitivity to commercial products, as well as the impact of her life and death on her young family. As a whole it was a moving reading experience.The story told is a very simple one, and I found how it is told completely effective. It is not surprising that some forms of cancer, even with treatment, are fatal. It is not surprising that poor black people in the USA remain poor over time, it is not surprising that difficult childhood experiences can overshadow later adult lives, it is even not surprising that something if not entirely free to obtain like the tissue sample in question, has come to be a source of profit for many companies while providing no benefit to either the donor’s family nor the institution which provided Henrietta Lacks with medical treatment and collected the sample in the first place. Perhaps part of the success of Skloot's narration is just how unsurprising those elements of the story are juxtaposed with the completely unexpected survival and continuing life of Henrietta Lacks' tissue sample. There is a recognisable slice of life married with something unique so far in science and of enduring scientific impact.For me the most serious downside is that I had the feeling that Skloot had hoped her book might start a public debate on issues of sample ownership, but so far that discussion so far has not escaped the courts. That leaves us with a great piece of non-fiction writing rather than a rallying cry for change."
513,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,5,"In reading non-fiction, and particularly scientific non-fiction, my two most frequent gripes are: a lack of personal story, and a lack of overall narrative. It's my opinion that just because a work isn't fiction, it shouldn't miss out on the use of structural elements more common to fiction: a strong narrative and narrative structure can improve any kind of communication.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a near-flawless implementation of this. The book has three components: the story of Henrietta and her family, the story of the science made possible by Henrietta, and the story of the author, Skloot, researching the book. I can't stress enough how effectively these three threads are woven together, making a educational, intersectional, and ultimately tragic story. If you are interested in the human side of scientific advance then this is an absolute, absolute must-read. Highly recommended."
514,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50066399-diane-in-australia,4,"Henrietta was the woman whose cultured cells ... the first to grow and survive indefinitely ... were taken without her knowledge. They turned out to be very essential to modern medical advancements.I found this to be an interesting book, mainly because it taught me a few science/medical bits, and it made me think more deeply about ethical issues related to tissue ownership. As always, I enjoyed the close-up views of racial issues.I'm glad that the author wrote this book, as I'm sure it helped Henrietta's family understand what really took place all those years ago. It also makes all of us aware of the debt we owe to Henrietta.4 Stars = Outstanding. It definitely held my interest."
515,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5036644-meredith-o-donnell,2,"Interesting concept. Reading it with my book club... Upate: Finished. I am always up for a rousing ethical debate. The deplorable breach of privacy, a basic human right, displayed in the book was appalling. Anyone who has ever been dehumanized can relate to the way Henrietta was objectified for the sake of science. It was beyond unconscionable. I am glad the story was told. I hope that Skloot's efforts will remind the industry of science and medicine that they need to be held accountable for their actions, and the finished product is not the only thing that matters, but the methods taken on their road to discovery count as well. Henrietta's cells have provided mankind with a lot to be grateful for, and for that we must thank the scientists and doctors who worked feverishly and masterfully, experimenting and coming up with new ideas. However, the people behind the cells have rights too. Bioethics have come a long way since the 1950's, but there are still flaws.  I learned in several journalism courses I took in college that the job of the journalist is to hold accountable those who serve the public--be it in politics, consumerism, or medicine. That is what Skloot has done by tackling the story of Henrietta Lacks--the person behind the immortal HeLa cell line. For that, I commend her. While I agreed with the endeavor, I had a few issues with her strategy. As others have mentioned, she placed herself in the story excessively. She claimed it was necessary, but I doubt if it was necessary to the extent that she did it. She seemed to want to constantly remind the reader of her plight. This is not the place of a journalist--just tell the story, don't tell your own story of getting the story. Also, she had an incredibly obvious bias, and a suspiciously not-so-obvious agenda. I did question Skloot's intentions. She spoke as an advocate for the Lacks family, but I do wonder whether or not she was a welcomed one, or a useful one.  She classifies the book as nonfiction upfront. And that it is. Or was intended to be... the story is real. But the details were so convoluted, shrouded and murky that it became difficult to truly believe with any authority one thing or the other. For instance, Skloot admits that the medical field was not proficient in recording things during this time (no computer.) Consequently, a lot of important details concerning Henrietta's illness, diagnosis, the retrieval of her cells, her death, her autopsy, her burial, among other factors, were not clearly documented. Also, Skloot's main sources of information were the Lacks family--a family frought with incest, disease, mental illness, partial deafness, drug abuse, a lack of intelligence and a lack of education--none of which was their fault, but all of which made them unreliable sources of information. For instance-- did Henrietta ever meet Gey? His assistant Mary swears yes. But Dave Lacks says absolutely not. The tie breaker is dead..and was on her death bed/twisted with pain/heavily medicated during the time of the alleged meeting so it is not out of the realm of possibilities that she either forgot about the encounter or didn't think to bring it up. It's also just as possible that Mary was confused (no documentation,) or was lying. I have no reason to believe one over the other. Also, Joe's murder. Skloot decided to present the family's convenient recollection of events authoritatively--that it was self defense. However, a witness testified under oath that the fatal attack was unprovoked. Again, I have no incentive to take one side over the other, but Skloot's selective storytelling contributed to my distrust of her as a narrator, a writer and a reporter.  When I read a nonfiction piece, I prefer for the facts to be indisputable. Aside from credibility issues, I also questioned Skloot's true motives. She hid behind an ultra-liberal facade: a sympathetic crusader who was empowering this poor, uneducated family with the voice they never had. But notice how she proudly boasts of a deep friendship with Deborah Lacks in the beginning of the book... but I wonder if Deborah, God rest her soul, would confirm this claim. We'll never know. Skloot seemed to pester the family, while at the same time condemning those who did the same...as if her reasons were more pure and justifiable. She also clearly lamented their lack of medical coverage and financial compensation, and a portion of the proceeds for the book will go to a scholarship fund for the family, but why didn't she just write them a big check? They didn't benefit directly. If you read closely, Skloot reveals that she had to agree to certain conditions before the Lacks family would agree to talk to her. She had to tell the family's story exactly the way it was told to her, whether facts were verified or not. She was so desperate to satisfy, what started out as her own morbid curiosity, and grew into an obsessive mission, that she agreed to this stipulation. That almost concealed little tidbit, combined with the unreliability and untrustworthiness of the medical profession during that time, left this reader skeptical of nearly every word. However, the subject matter and her insistance to reinstate the human side to a research subject, as well as the fact that Skloot manages to make very technical terminology and notions perfectly clear to a former B student in Biology, earn the writer one star each. I recommend reading along side Oliver Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat-- another nonfiction piece about the humanization of patients. Meredith O'Donnell"
516,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is fascinating and heartbreaking in equal measure. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Before she died, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in cultures for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory. Those cells, known as HeLa, are still alive today and have advanced medicine and science in countless ways; it seems there's no end to the list of discoveries made because of HeLa.I've tried to imagine how [Henrietta would] feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. Henrietta's cells helped launch the fledgling field of virology. As the Cold War escalated, some scientists exposed Henrietta's cells to massive doses of radiation to study how nuclear bombs destroyed cells and find ways to reverse that damage. Others put them in special centrifuges that spun so fast the pressure inside was more than 100,000 times that of gravity, to see what happened to human cells under the extreme conditions of deep-sea diving or spaceflight. The author took great care to learn about Henrietta Lacks. She paints Henrietta as a woman who accepted her illness and faced her treatment with unparalleled resilience and strength. One afternoon, as Henrietta lay on the couch, she lifted her shirt to show Margaret and Sadie what the treatments had done to her. Sadie gasped: The skin from Henrietta's breasts to her pelvis was charred a deep black from the radiation. The rest of her body was its normal shade -- more the color of fawn than coal. ""Hennie,"" she whispered, ""they burn you black as tar."" Henrietta just nodded and said, ""Lord, it just feels like that blackness be spreadin all inside me."" Cancer is a foul creature, sinister and terrifying, but Henrietta's cancer was a force of evil from the nadir of Hell. It ravaged her body in unmerciful ways; it's no wonder those cells survived in a test tube where all other cells died. Suddenly [Henrietta's] body went rigid as a board. She screamed as the nurse ran to the bed, tightening the straps around Henrietta's arms and legs to keep her from thrashing onto the floor as she'd done many times before. Gladys thrust the pillow from her lap into Henrietta's mouth, to keep her from biting her tongue as she convulsed in pain. The book is extensive; all of the information is efficiently organized and comprehensive. Part of what makes this book so tantalizing are all of the near-misses, all of the moments when the author was turned down in her quest to learn the truth about Henrietta Lacks. Had she given up, as so many others did, Henrietta Lacks might have been forgotten and this riveting book would have never existed. "
517,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6942006-suzy,5,"I was completely in the thrall of author Rebecca Skloot while listening to the audio of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. This is at once a scientific story of Henrietta's cancer cells, called HeLa, which were harvested from her as she was dying from cervical cancer in 1951. These are the first human cells to become ""immortal"", perpetuating themselves even to today, and being used in many important health discoveries including polio vaccines, in vitro fertilization, aids research, cancer drugs and too many others to mention. It is also the story of Henrietta and her family, who had no idea that their mother's cells were taken or the importance of the cells to medicine. Her children learn about this from Skloot's research and this knowledge causes misunderstandings and various reactions in Henrietta's adult children from some wanting financial remuneration to others just wanting their mother to be honored and respected for her contribution to science. My heart went out to Henrietta and her family who, because they were poor and black, were treated, and lived, as second class citizens. They are often at the mercy of their many health problems through lack of education, lack of access to health insurance and suspicions about the medical establishment. It seems so unjust! (Thanks to GR friend Will Byrnes for posting this NY Times article on the consent agreement reached with the family finally . . . 62 years later. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/sci...)At first I found the structure of the book a little frustrating because it jumped in both time and storyline, but once I decided to just flow with it, I was completely engaged. I think listening helped. It was as if the author was telling her story just to me, and that I was discovering it side-by-side with her. There are so many layers, that my thought is there's something to connect to for everyone based on a reader's interests coming to the book. Skloot reveals early in the book that she learned about HeLa in a biology class when she was younger and decided then and there to research and write about them. Little did she know that she would be telling the story of the Lacks family right along with the scientific importance of the cells. I appreciated the interview at the end of the audio where Skloot tells us how she decided on the focus and the structure of the book. This was the February book club pick at our wonderful art museum here in Minneapolis, and I enjoyed the discussion. I'm eagerly anticipating the HBO movie based on the book which will be aired April 22 here in the States. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5686132/"

The list of her contributions to science go on and on.Henrietta’s cells were taken without her permission or knowledge in early 1951. More than twenty years would pass before her family ever found out. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is Henrietta’s story, the story of her cell’s contribution to science, and the story of her family. I learned a lot from this book about Henrietta, science, and past and present patient rights in the United States. Some of the information found on these pages are truly alarming.

522,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20015365-may,4,"As a medical student, I was, and still am ashamed, that I knew next-to-nothing about Henrietta Lacks and the HUGE contribution her cells have made to science. The fact that her family can't even get reliable health insurance really just adds insult to injury. This is a well-researched, well-written book. The issue it discusses is extremely important, and the last chapter about tissue ownership is outright terrifying. It was the first time I heard of ""gene patents"" (what?), and this:Myriad Genetics, which holds the patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes responsible for most cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, charges $3,000 to test for the genes. Myriad has been accused of creating a monopoly, since no one else can offer the test, and researchers can’t develop cheaper tests or new therapies without getting permission from Myriad and paying steep licensing fees. Scientists who’ve gone ahead with research involving the breast-cancer genes without Myriad’s permission have found themselves on the receiving end of cease-and-desist letters and threats of litigation.I don't know what to say. I think this paragraph sums it up very well:
The debate over the commercialization of human biological materials always comes back to one fundamental point: like it or not, we live in a market-driven society, and science is part of that market. Baruch Blumberg, the Nobel Prize-winning researcher who used Ted Slavin’s antibodies for hepatitis B research, told me, “Whether you think the commercialization of medical research is good or bad depends on how into capitalism you are.” On the whole, Blumberg said, commercialization is good; how else would we get the drugs and diagnostic tests we need? Still, he sees a downside. “I think it’s fair to say it’s interfered with science,” he said. “It’s changed the spirit.” Now there are patents and proprietary information where there once was free information flow. “Researchers have become entrepreneurs. That’s boomed our economy and created incentives to do research. But it’s also brought problems, like secrecy and arguments over who owns what.”

523,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,5,"This is a phenomenal book. If it doesn't win every non-fiction award for 2010 than whoever votes for non-fiction awards should have their library cards taken away from them*.The author, Rebecca Skloot, does a masterful job of seamlessly weaving in the scientific story of Henrietta Lacks' immortal cells and the effect they have had on medicine and medical ethics with a real human interest story about Henrietta and the struggles of her family. Skloot does this without coming across as maudlin, preachy, overly technical, guilt ridden, condescending, or just plain boring. She deftly weaves two legs of one story together, darting in and out with ease and keeping the reader interested in learning the science and caring about the people. She does this all while doing her best to avoid passing judgment or creating villains. Like a good journalist, she simply reports the facts of a fantastically and seemingly thoroughly researched book and lets the reader interpret them as they will.In all, this is not only a terrific science book that is not afraid to tackle gray areas of ethics and leave them unanswered without getting preachy, not only a gripping human interest story with more than one human we are interested in, but also a socioeconomic look at the educational opportunities and struggles of poor, disadvantaged people across several generations of our country. Most of all though, this is a uniquely American story.*Seeing as how Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World by Liaquat Ahamed won the last Pulitzer for history, perhaps voters should have already had their library cards taken from them because that book was so bad I wouldn't even use it as a doorstop and besmirch the dignity of my door."

525,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,4,"Henrietta Lacks develops cervical cancer is the 1950's, goes into Johns Hopkins Hospital and after a couple of horrific treatments passes away. Her cells are another story, they continued to live on after biopsies of her cancerous tissue was taken without her permission or her family's knowledge and grown in labs to be shipped around the world to test diseases, develop gene therapy, and ultimately change the world. All the while, her children and family had no idea that this was happening, and they struggle to come to terms with what it means to have immortal cells, while the family can barely afford medical treatment.Rebecca Skloot takes a nearly impossible task of researching something that was breaking at the time, and challenges human rights to our own tissue and most importantly how client consent has changed over the past couple of decades. Fascinating story merging the lines of racial and gender discrimination, while also facing class struggles. In my opinion, this book should be required reading."
526,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9554958-sara,1,"The story behind the infamous ""HeLa"" cells are interesting to most scientists, as most of us have either worked with them, read endless research articles/journals utilizing them, and know about their contributions to science and/or medicine, among many more things. This immortal cell line was derived from Mrs. Lacks' cervical tissue, which became cancerous after she was infected with HPV. She recieved treatment for cervical canver at Johns Hopkins University, known at this time period for treating black patients. Though I don't know how her race/ethnicity/social status affected her personal treatment at the hospital, the actual medical treatment for her condition was unbiased and the normal protocol for any one with the condition. During this time period, research physicians, or physicians who were interetsed in biomedical research were striving to culture an immortal cell line, which has enormous applications and implications in biomedical research. The physicians, with the help of other scientists and technicians, were able to create a cell line that had greatly sought-after conditions for the purposes of biomedical research, inlcuding immortalization and ease of growth in culture. The use of her cells greatly impacted the field of biomedical research, and the cultivation and use of the HeLA cell line contributed to the establishment of the first Polio vaccine, cancer research, and countless other types of research where the characteristics of the HeLa cell line offer great advatange and resource for pusuit of scientific knowledge. My review of this book has nothing to do with the contributions her cells have made to the scientific community. The physicians at the time did take her cells and culture them without her consent, but that was standard protocol at the time, and she was not isolated for that purpose. We have all contributed from the use of her cells, therefore, it is hypocritical to be critical of the use of them.Despite a major attempt to create a ""boogey-man"" portrait of the physicians/scientists that worked with her cells, none of them were awarded financially for establishing the HeLa cell line. The author tries to create an image of a poor black woman who was robbed of her cells without consent and not awarded the enormous monentary prize for their use, but the truth is, this was standard procedure at that time period,and her cells just happened to actually work for that purpose. I was very interested to learn more about Mrs. Lacks in this book. What made this book impossible to read was the author. She hardly writes more than a few pages about Mrs. Lacks. She mostly wrote a biography detailing her attempts at finding information, without providing anything insightful about the actual woman it was supposed to be about, Mrs. Lacks. Most of the book is about her relatives and their immense anger and resentment about not being compensated for the use of Mrs. Lacks' cells. I don't really give a shit about that. A lot of shitty things happen to people in this world, this wasn't in any way the worst, and that would have made a decent book if that was what the book was supposed to be about. This book was so boring, I didn't even finish it. "
527,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"This book has been around for a while now, so most people know the basis. Rebecca Skloot tells the story here of Henrietta Lacks, the poor black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1951. Why do we care about Henrietta Lacks? Quite simply, her cells, which were taken without her knowledge or consent, became known as HeLa cells. Now does it sound familiar? HeLa cells have been around for a while, recognizable to many for their importance in developing the polio vaccine and gene mapping. HeLa cells have survived and grown since 1951.But Skloot recognized there was more to the science than just the letters HeLa. She set out to uncover the truth about the person behind the abbreviation. With the help of members of Lacks's family, Skloot spent about a decade on this book. She visited the now-defunct Clover, where Lacks grew up, she took Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, to the hospital where her sister, Elsie, was put away as an ""imbecile"" and where she died under suspicious circumstances. Deborah, who was four when Henrietta died, was just as committed to finding out the full story about her family as Skloot was.The book bounces around in time, from the 40s and 50s as Skloot detailed Henrietta's life and illness, to ""present day"" of 2009 when the book was published. Skloot's own journey with her research began in the late 90s. She got married and divorced during the writing of this book. She knew Henrietta Lacks was unknown by the public, even though her cells had been such a vital part of medicine and science for decades.The heartbreaking part about this real-life story is that Henrietta's descendants and family knew nothing about the HeLa cells themselves. They were never given any real explanation about the cells, nor were they compensated in any way. The book brings to light a lot of issues, from social to ethical. Most impressive is the concept that all tissue in and on your body belongs to you while it's attached to you, but as soon as it's removed from you, it's not longer ""yours"". You have no rights over it. It can be researched and sold and re-sold and modified and studies. You get no say in whether you want studies on pieces of your body to go towards the cure for cancer or for the creation of atomic bombs or other devices of mass destruction.Years ago I had a cyst removed. Thinking of a Margaret Atwood story, I asked my surgeon (and every subsequent tech and anesthesiologist whom I met prior to surgery) if I could keep my cyst once they excised it. After their initial responses of ""Ew, WHY?"" they told me that would not, could not, should not ever be available to me. ""But it's MINE"" I tried to argue. They claimed liability, and disease (not that I had a disease, but it's jut not sanitary). None of them had read the Atwood story I was referencing, but if they had, they would have been even more adamant that I should be allowed nowhere near the cyst once it had been removed.I've thought about the same thing during a breast biopsy and then more recently, when they removed my thyroid. What are they going to do with it? What I really would like, more than being able to keep these things that have been pulled from my body over the years, is frequent updates about the road my tissues have traveled. Remember in the 90s the popularity of things like adopting a star, or a whale, or a polar bear. You'd get a picture in the mail for the low-cost of whatever, and then a few updates throughout the year about where your whale is and how it is faring.That's what I want with the tissues that have been taken from me. Just a postcard with a picture of what they're doing with my tissues, a little update that says ""ElPa cell was just sold to Norway for the price of 8 million where they will study the effects of cigarette smoking on this tissue taken from your breast in the early 2000s!""As Skloot spent more time with the Lacks family, she became almost a member of the family herself. After the initial periods of suspicion and caution, Skloot was embraced and was called for all the important family births and deaths and other major life experiences. From a personal storytelling point of view, I found that touching, though it wasn't exactly a necessary part of the main story.I suppose really it means that HeLa (Henrietta Lacks) is a part of everyone, brings us all together. She continues to live, and while her family will never see any portion of the proceeds and still have no say over their mother's cells, there's some satisfaction that can be derived from how common the name Henrietta Lacks is now. The woman behind the cells should never be forgotten. Her contributions (that she didn't even know she was making) should be told. She was more than just the abbreviations HeLa.I know everyone has read this book already by this point, but it came up in my little world because I'm now on the Common Reader Committee at the university where I work. At the first meeting, it became obvious that very few of us are actually readers (one went so far as to say he doesn't like to read, which begs the question as to why he was even there). This book was one of my recommendations, even though I hadn't read it yet. My boss read the first six chapters and felt that it would cover a lot of the bases that our university likes to cover, and would appeal to the three main colleges very well by dealing with social justice issues, science and medicine, legality, ethics, and health and wellness.Now that I've read this book on my own I can go back to our meeting next week and say, holy shit guys, this book really does cover ALL the bases. The idea is this would be a book that everyone could read - every student, staff, and faculty member. While the story meanders a bit and gets a bit dry in other places, I think ultimately the story of Henrietta Lacks and her cells will appeal to all readers in the university.But if I hear one more time from anyone ""But are they mature enough for it"" I will scream. College students aren't quite as dumb as everyone likes to think they are. Maybe they're lazy, but cheese and rice, I'm not going to dumb down the Common Reader in concerns that students won't be able to read a book anymore.Plus there's an HBO movie coming out next month based on this book, so if just reading a book isn't incentive enough, maybe Oprah will be.(My other top contenders would be The Handmaid's Tale and March: Book One. Though some on the committee thinks if we give a graphic novel to college students they will think we're giving them ""cartoons"" to read and there may be an uprising. It's fascinating to me how little faculty and staff know the students at their own university. To be fair, those who suggest an uprising are also the ones who don't read, and they claim not to know how to read a graphic novel. Someone asked ""Do you start at the front or the back?"" conflating graphic novels with manga, I believe. This committee will be a long road for me. Someone just put me in charge already.)"

It chronicles the life of the woman whose cancerous tissue became the first tissue in history which could be successfully grown as culture and used in various, and countless, experiments from vaccine research to cloning. Her tissue was so successful in fact that it became virtually immortal, surviving in various environments and proliferating at prodigious rates. Yet, very little was known about the woman herself, her life, her family, her history, and this is what Skloot set out to uncover. What she found out is absolutely stunning from the point of medical ethics, American history and American healthcare. Fascinating. Highly recommended."

530,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27544898-bookishrealm,5,"This book was phenomenal in more ways than one. I knew a little bit about Henrietta Lacks, but I was definitely not aware of the extent to which her family was affected by the use of her sells in modern day biology. It broke my heart to see how her family, deeply rooted in religious beliefs, was broken because they felt as though Henrietta's soul resided in those cells. I have my own personal opinions about the entire concept of doctors taking medical waste for their own advantages. Nevertheless, what I can say about this issue is that it is stories such as the Tuskegee Experiment and the use of Henrietta's cells that have ultimately made the black community hesitant about wanting to go to doctors. I plan to do more research on this topic and it may be a project that I throw myself into. Hopefully I can find more text that really delves into the black community's experience with the medical field. This really opened my eyes to a lot of issues related to the medical field/industry and I can't wait to read more. "

I like a book that makes me think, just as I did when I was a college student. There's a fine line between what is ethically/morally ""right"" and that which infringes on a person's own being and that person's (or family of said person) rights to his/her cells. There are never any correct answers or final conclusions in the world of bioethics...it's an ongoing dispute but one that really caused me to question my own decisions and how they are interpreted."
532,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is required reading for pharmaceutical students at a nearby Oklahoma University where a friend of my daughter goes to college. She told me about this book over Christmas. I can see why it’s required reading. I’m glad it is and I hope it is for medical and research students everywhere.It tells the story of an African American woman, Henrietta Lacks, who went to Johns Hopkins in 1951 for treatment for cervical cancer. Some cancerous cells were removed from her body. This much she knew. The cells were also saved, cultured, and reproduced—without her knowledge or consent—as was common practice at the time. What makes this an amazing story is that Henrietta’s cells have never died from that day until the present, hence the title. They continue to grow and reproduce at a phenomenal rate. They currently exist in laboratories, hospitals and warehouses all over the world; have been used in almost every form of scientific research from the 50’s until now; have gone to space; have been contaminated and caused contamination. The scientific and medical communities owe untold debt to the cells it calls HeLa and yet not one dime of compensation, even in terms of discounted medical care or health insurance has ever been received by any of Henrietta’s numerous descendants. Interestingly enough, they aren’t looking for anything in that way. Now isn’t that refreshing? Rather, in spite of all they have suffered—and indeed this is a book about pain—their focal interest throughout was in finding out what happened to their mother since she died so young, gaining recognition for her and learning what happened to Henrietta’s oldest daughter who died in a ‘hospital for the negro insane’, which was 1950’s terminology.  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks crosses many disciplines and for that reason I expect scientists might skim the vignettes about Henrietta’s children, while those who prefer human interest could find themselves avoiding the technical sections. Virginia Woolf’s Common Readers, however, will positively adore this book! It has everything they look for in the written word. Not only what was just mentioned, but also: the complexities and importance of the ‘tissue issue’, what are the medical, legal, ethical, and other parameters for tissue gathering, storage, research, usage, and compensation. And I commend the author, Rebecca Skloot, a self-proclaimed non-believer for her sensitive handling of the many stressed and stressful events, issues and personalities she encountered concerning matters of faith, morals, and religion.  A very important book to read!  Here is a rather long but fascinating 1998 BBC documentary about Henrietta Lacks and HeLa.  Here is an article which gives some more current info about the Lacks family and the issue of privacy v. tissue donation. "
533,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"Henrietta Lacks, a young African-American mother of five children, died in Baltimore in 1951 from a highly aggressive form of cervical cancer—but more than fifty years after her death, part of her lives on in the form of HeLa, a cell line cultivated from a tissue sample of hers which played a key role in several major scientific and medical breakthroughs. Skloot's book tells Lacks' story, partly to pay tribute to a woman who was forgotten by all but her family for many years despite her importance to medicine; partly in order to examine the complex attendant issues of medical ethics, race and class. Skloot's writing is fluid and accessible, and I learned some things which were shocking though not surprising to me (see the organ retention scandal which broke in Ireland a few years ago). That said, I would have liked for a stronger focus on the ethics and the science aspect of the novel and less on the lives of Lacks' children and other relatives. Skloot's focus on them and on some of the more unpalatable aspects of their lives felt quite voyeuristic to me at points, recounted not because Skloot wanted to examine the effects of the vicious cycle of poverty on people's lives but because it would inject more drama into the book. The author talks at length about the less-than-pure motivations of those who had previously profited from Lacks' cells, and their refusal to compensate Lacks' family in any way, about how she was financing her research with credit cards and student loans—and yet her end-goal was always to acquire a book deal, and her account of her relentless attempts to get in touch with members of the Lacks family made me highly uncomfortable. Much of the latter half of the book dealt with the relationship between Skloot and Deborah, Henrietta Lacks' youngest daughter—again, uncomfortable to read about at several points, and not especially relevant to the book's main thrust. Overall, an interesting read, but I feel that The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks could easily have been edited down to half its length—and focused more on Henrietta because of it."
534,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/925949-jude,5,"it's as if the writer wanted the story the way i would want it, and self-observes the arc of her own education the way i would, so the emotional style resonated at a profound level: a combination of passion, humility & fearlessness that makes me trust the her completely, that makes me grateful she is the person who chose this story - or that it chose her.& then there's the story - the science. the race & class issues, the muck of medical ethics before patients were real people and blackfolk were real patients... that's the warp. The weft is the story of a friendship between two women meeting each other on the edge of both their worlds, brought there by Henrietta: her immortality is not simply a series of cells.the narrators are excellent. the pacing is a tiny bit slow, but that works for the direct quotes - and hearing voices in dialect anchors the story in time and place. The voices in this story - the amount of quoted text & speech- keep this story very immediate - with the feel of a good documentary or good fiction.a joy."

I tell you the premise, and that's the book. It just keeps doubling over itself to tell you the same science, the same sad story of the people it affected, and nothing ever really happens. People say things like ""hold on, are you ready for this?"" and then nothing happens. It's the same information over and over. So I'm going to spoil the whole book for you; Henrietta Lacks was a poor syphilitic black woman who married her cousin, had a bunch of kids, and died very young of an aggressive cancer, the cells of which doctors took samples of without asking and then developed into the first 'immortal' cell line, which went on to be used by scientist and doctors around the world. Her descendants are plagued by poverty and bad health. That's it. Now imagine me telling you different versions of that over and over while I also tell you about how I'm researching and writing about it, dealing with this difficult and suspicious relatives. That's the book. "

Henrietta Lacks was a poor black women who cells were taken without her consent and used by many scientists to develop vaccines,cloning, and many more things. Unfortunately her family was very poor and never received any money from her cells being used.They had many health problems and could not afford health insurance and died young as a result.

538,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"Its a very important story, its unique in its format of that the cells of Henrietta lacks are doing and how it seems that even today nobody understand why or how those cells are even still alive, BUT sadly the actual story of doctors doing something without permission is NOT a unique one, since sadly there are still today patients being used without their knowledge -as it is even stated in the book itself. And i think that especially that is something that should be taking away from this book: This story is important and interesting, but so far not much has changed in the medical field so that this type of thing does not continues to happen without permission from the patients themselves. This book does point out quiet a lot of positive things that happened because and with cells and how it could have never happened without them. Some horrendous things, some wonderful things where achieved thanks to those cells and with that thanks to Henrietta Lacks. And i am defiantly one of the first people to point out that medical advances are necessary and that we still have way to little knowledge and actual solutions for way to man illnesses! But i think that this book also points out two very important things and drives them home quiet nicely: 1. Human tissue was once part of a person!We all should respect that. Yes its important that a lot of different science fields have access to tissue samples. But its also important to remember the people that gave those samples. Be it willingly, unwillingly, during life or after their death, it was once part of a living breathing person! I think a lot of us prefer to ignore that, or try to forget it and i think that is defiantly one thing we all should work on always remembering when we take any kind of medicine without a second thought! 2. there are lot of loopholes legally that should be worked on!All this talk of ""technically it wasn't required"" in this book just made me want to shake someone! What it comes down to in very basic forms -especially in regards of this specific book and the story it tells- is that everyone should be asking for permission. Doctors and scientists should explain in understandable terms what they want and why it could be helpful and i am pretty sure that a lot of people -especially those with illnesses!- will be more than willing to hand out tissue samples for further use! No need to just take them without asking! So why do it?Which brings it all back to the first point: lets not forget all those ""samples"" actually come from someone that is not just there to be a lab-rat!Now the one ""negative"" thing of this book is that i personally didn't really like how the Skloot wrote this book. Some sections felt as if she wanted to get that particular part of the story told and done with as fast as possible and shoved a lot of details and information into a pretty small section and number of pages. And than sometimes she would go on and on about some things for endless number of pages that i personally felt that it wasn't necessary to go on about it for that long. To say it short it is not he best nonfiction writing i have read. BUT its also far from the worst. Its very readable and yes it could have been kept a little shorter, but all in all it was done pretty well in the writing department. of course that is completely personal and some of the reviews i read LOVED the writing, so clearly that part is debatable.If you are interested in this book, defiantly give it a try. If you are going into a scientific field? Defiantly read this!"
539,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,"A book like this makes me realize how important education in general and particularly science education is. Today’s science is yesterday’s magic—for those who don’t understand science, it can seem like very frightening black magic. The story of Henrietta Lacks explores the intersection between science, research, education, capitalism, civil rights, and consent.The major question implicit in this book is whether we have any claim to our own cells after they have been removed from our bodies. Is it ethical to take “discarded” cells—those left over after medical procedures—and do research from them and potentially make money from either the cells or the research. This issue gets us down somewhere in our irrational subconscious—after all, we all “know” enough about voodoo and black magic to know that curses require hair, nail clippings, blood, or other bodily secretions in order to be effective. In many ways, the story of the HeLa cell line traces the history of medical research in the US (and to some extent, other countries), evolving from the exploitation of vulnerable people towards the concept of informed consent. It also traces the history of an African American family, liberated from slavery, but not from poverty and deprivation. The current distrust of science has some real roots in situations like these, where people were used without their knowledge for experimental purposes. But the lack of scientific literacy in the general population helps with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and the prevalence of medical quackery. Witness all the “miracle cures” that people buy into. One older lady that I used to work with was always pouring money into some miracle weight loss scheme or another—it didn’t seem to occur to her that if the method actually worked, it would be front page news on Time magazine, not some obscure ad in the back of a newspaper.We have to seriously question ourselves and our politicians about the quality of our educational systems. Are they being funded? Do we have enough teachers? Can poor children hope to get education equal to that of rich children?As my grandfather used to say, no education is wasted."
540,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,5,"Henrietta Lacks is a woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951. The cells cut from her body, because of their aptitude for growth and replication, still play a significant role in treating disease and other medical tests. She did not know her cells were being used, and her family did not benefit financially. The author writes extensively about her family, as they were a crucial source for the book. Because of so many trust relationships violated over the years, she had to first work to build trust and prove herself reliable. She went on to establish a trust for the family.This book discusses science, both the present state of medicine while Henrietta was being treated for cervical cancer (nothing short of radium tube inserts and lead!) and how science has grown in its understandings and treatments because of her cells. The book has to address the ways African Americans have been treated badly by the American medical establishment from Tuskagee to forced sterilizations, to even some patients injected with Henrietta's cells without their knowledge! I felt like I knew much of the story already, but only because this book has received so much acclaim and press, and I find rightly so. I'm not a scientist but felt I could understand it as Skloot presented the information.I also learned some terrifying things that don't soothe my paranoia. Huge government stores of cells that no longer belong to you - not owning the rights to your bodily tissue - still all true in the 21st century. Ever wonder where your blood, teeth, etc. got to? Ha. I read this during Banned Books Week 2015 because earlier this year it was challenged by a Tennessee mother who felt it was ""pornographic."" The woman had cervical cancer, cancer of the CERVIX, a body part all women have. Oh please. This book isn't pornography, it's science. Discussed on Episode 042 of the Reading Envy Podcast."
541,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186579-kate,1,"This book irritated me from the beginning. It couldn't decide if it was a history of the cells, the life story of one woman, a chronicle of how an author tracks down the life story of a woman, a position paper on racism, a position paper on human tissue ownership, or a position paper on disorganized rhetoric. I think it was all of those, and it drove me absolutely up the wall.As a history of the HeLa cells ... I read a Wired article that was better.As the life story of Henrietta Lacks ... it read like a list of facts instead of a human interest piece. And it kept going on tangents (with the life stories of each of her children, her doctors, etc.)As the story of the author tracking down a story ... that was actually kind of interesting.As a position paper on racism...it had a lot of disturbing stories - but no cohesive point.As a position paper on human tissue ownership... the best chapter was the last one, which actually listed facts and laws. And while the author clearly had an opinion in that chapter -it was more focused and less full of unrelated stories intended to pull on your hearts strings and shift your opinion.As a position paper on disorganized rhetoric...it was a stellar exemplar."

In any case what kind of bearing does the number of copies sold have on the amount that a book is read? The success of Rebecca Skloot's book is maybe entirely unsurprising as it covers a wide range of angles and caters for many tastes. It has something of the ever popular misery mémoire, some social history, an investigative aspect with detective road trips, along with an exploration of one of the wonders of modern science. All of this comes together in two alternating narrative strands, the death of Henrietta Lacks from cancer and the strange ongoing life and use of a tissue sample collected from her that has been used for a host of purposes from cancer research to gene mapping to assessing human sensitivity to commercial products, as well as the impact of her life and death on her young family. As a whole it was a moving reading experience.The story told is a very simple one, and I found how it is told completely effective. It is not surprising that some forms of cancer, even with treatment, are fatal. It is not surprising that poor black people in the USA remain poor over time, it is not surprising that difficult childhood experiences can overshadow later adult lives, it is even not surprising that something if not entirely free to obtain like the tissue sample in question, has come to be a source of profit for many companies while providing no benefit to either the donor’s family nor the institution which provided Henrietta Lacks with medical treatment and collected the sample in the first place. Perhaps part of the success of Skloot's narration is just how unsurprising those elements of the story are juxtaposed with the completely unexpected survival and continuing life of Henrietta Lacks' tissue sample. There is a recognisable slice of life married with something unique so far in science and of enduring scientific impact.For me the most serious downside is that I had the feeling that Skloot had hoped her book might start a public debate on issues of sample ownership, but so far that discussion so far has not escaped the courts. That leaves us with a great piece of non-fiction writing rather than a rallying cry for change."
543,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,5,"In reading non-fiction, and particularly scientific non-fiction, my two most frequent gripes are: a lack of personal story, and a lack of overall narrative. It's my opinion that just because a work isn't fiction, it shouldn't miss out on the use of structural elements more common to fiction: a strong narrative and narrative structure can improve any kind of communication.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a near-flawless implementation of this. The book has three components: the story of Henrietta and her family, the story of the science made possible by Henrietta, and the story of the author, Skloot, researching the book. I can't stress enough how effectively these three threads are woven together, making a educational, intersectional, and ultimately tragic story. If you are interested in the human side of scientific advance then this is an absolute, absolute must-read. Highly recommended."

They turned out to be very essential to modern medical advancements.I found this to be an interesting book, mainly because it taught me a few science/medical bits, and it made me think more deeply about ethical issues related to tissue ownership. As always, I enjoyed the close-up views of racial issues.I'm glad that the author wrote this book, as I'm sure it helped Henrietta's family understand what really took place all those years ago.

545,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5036644-meredith-o-donnell,2,"Interesting concept. Reading it with my book club... Upate: Finished. I am always up for a rousing ethical debate. The deplorable breach of privacy, a basic human right, displayed in the book was appalling. Anyone who has ever been dehumanized can relate to the way Henrietta was objectified for the sake of science. It was beyond unconscionable. I am glad the story was told. I hope that Skloot's efforts will remind the industry of science and medicine that they need to be held accountable for their actions, and the finished product is not the only thing that matters, but the methods taken on their road to discovery count as well. Henrietta's cells have provided mankind with a lot to be grateful for, and for that we must thank the scientists and doctors who worked feverishly and masterfully, experimenting and coming up with new ideas. However, the people behind the cells have rights too. Bioethics have come a long way since the 1950's, but there are still flaws.  I learned in several journalism courses I took in college that the job of the journalist is to hold accountable those who serve the public--be it in politics, consumerism, or medicine. That is what Skloot has done by tackling the story of Henrietta Lacks--the person behind the immortal HeLa cell line. For that, I commend her. While I agreed with the endeavor, I had a few issues with her strategy. As others have mentioned, she placed herself in the story excessively. She claimed it was necessary, but I doubt if it was necessary to the extent that she did it. She seemed to want to constantly remind the reader of her plight. This is not the place of a journalist--just tell the story, don't tell your own story of getting the story. Also, she had an incredibly obvious bias, and a suspiciously not-so-obvious agenda. I did question Skloot's intentions. She spoke as an advocate for the Lacks family, but I do wonder whether or not she was a welcomed one, or a useful one.  She classifies the book as nonfiction upfront. And that it is. Or was intended to be... the story is real. But the details were so convoluted, shrouded and murky that it became difficult to truly believe with any authority one thing or the other. For instance, Skloot admits that the medical field was not proficient in recording things during this time (no computer.) Consequently, a lot of important details concerning Henrietta's illness, diagnosis, the retrieval of her cells, her death, her autopsy, her burial, among other factors, were not clearly documented. Also, Skloot's main sources of information were the Lacks family--a family frought with incest, disease, mental illness, partial deafness, drug abuse, a lack of intelligence and a lack of education--none of which was their fault, but all of which made them unreliable sources of information. For instance-- did Henrietta ever meet Gey? His assistant Mary swears yes. But Dave Lacks says absolutely not. The tie breaker is dead..and was on her death bed/twisted with pain/heavily medicated during the time of the alleged meeting so it is not out of the realm of possibilities that she either forgot about the encounter or didn't think to bring it up. It's also just as possible that Mary was confused (no documentation,) or was lying. I have no reason to believe one over the other. Also, Joe's murder. Skloot decided to present the family's convenient recollection of events authoritatively--that it was self defense. However, a witness testified under oath that the fatal attack was unprovoked. Again, I have no incentive to take one side over the other, but Skloot's selective storytelling contributed to my distrust of her as a narrator, a writer and a reporter.  When I read a nonfiction piece, I prefer for the facts to be indisputable. Aside from credibility issues, I also questioned Skloot's true motives. She hid behind an ultra-liberal facade: a sympathetic crusader who was empowering this poor, uneducated family with the voice they never had. But notice how she proudly boasts of a deep friendship with Deborah Lacks in the beginning of the book... but I wonder if Deborah, God rest her soul, would confirm this claim. We'll never know. Skloot seemed to pester the family, while at the same time condemning those who did the same...as if her reasons were more pure and justifiable. She also clearly lamented their lack of medical coverage and financial compensation, and a portion of the proceeds for the book will go to a scholarship fund for the family, but why didn't she just write them a big check? They didn't benefit directly. If you read closely, Skloot reveals that she had to agree to certain conditions before the Lacks family would agree to talk to her. She had to tell the family's story exactly the way it was told to her, whether facts were verified or not. She was so desperate to satisfy, what started out as her own morbid curiosity, and grew into an obsessive mission, that she agreed to this stipulation. That almost concealed little tidbit, combined with the unreliability and untrustworthiness of the medical profession during that time, left this reader skeptical of nearly every word. However, the subject matter and her insistance to reinstate the human side to a research subject, as well as the fact that Skloot manages to make very technical terminology and notions perfectly clear to a former B student in Biology, earn the writer one star each. I recommend reading along side Oliver Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat-- another nonfiction piece about the humanization of patients. Meredith O'Donnell"
546,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is fascinating and heartbreaking in equal measure. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Before she died, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in cultures for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory. Those cells, known as HeLa, are still alive today and have advanced medicine and science in countless ways; it seems there's no end to the list of discoveries made because of HeLa.I've tried to imagine how [Henrietta would] feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. Henrietta's cells helped launch the fledgling field of virology. As the Cold War escalated, some scientists exposed Henrietta's cells to massive doses of radiation to study how nuclear bombs destroyed cells and find ways to reverse that damage. Others put them in special centrifuges that spun so fast the pressure inside was more than 100,000 times that of gravity, to see what happened to human cells under the extreme conditions of deep-sea diving or spaceflight. The author took great care to learn about Henrietta Lacks. She paints Henrietta as a woman who accepted her illness and faced her treatment with unparalleled resilience and strength. One afternoon, as Henrietta lay on the couch, she lifted her shirt to show Margaret and Sadie what the treatments had done to her. Sadie gasped: The skin from Henrietta's breasts to her pelvis was charred a deep black from the radiation. The rest of her body was its normal shade -- more the color of fawn than coal. ""Hennie,"" she whispered, ""they burn you black as tar."" Henrietta just nodded and said, ""Lord, it just feels like that blackness be spreadin all inside me."" Cancer is a foul creature, sinister and terrifying, but Henrietta's cancer was a force of evil from the nadir of Hell. It ravaged her body in unmerciful ways; it's no wonder those cells survived in a test tube where all other cells died. Suddenly [Henrietta's] body went rigid as a board. She screamed as the nurse ran to the bed, tightening the straps around Henrietta's arms and legs to keep her from thrashing onto the floor as she'd done many times before. Gladys thrust the pillow from her lap into Henrietta's mouth, to keep her from biting her tongue as she convulsed in pain. The book is extensive; all of the information is efficiently organized and comprehensive. Part of what makes this book so tantalizing are all of the near-misses, all of the moments when the author was turned down in her quest to learn the truth about Henrietta Lacks. Had she given up, as so many others did, Henrietta Lacks might have been forgotten and this riveting book would have never existed. "

These are the first human cells to become ""immortal"", perpetuating themselves even to today, and being used in many important health discoveries including polio vaccines, in vitro fertilization, aids research, cancer drugs and too many others to mention. It is also the story of Henrietta and her family, who had no idea that their mother's cells were taken or the importance of the cells to medicine. Her children learn about this from Skloot's research and this knowledge causes misunderstandings and various reactions in Henrietta's adult children from some wanting financial remuneration to others just wanting their mother to be honored and respected for her contribution to science. My heart went out to Henrietta and her family who, because they were poor and black, were treated, and lived, as second class citizens. They are often at the mercy of their many health problems through lack of education, lack of access to health insurance and suspicions about the medical establishment. It seems so unjust! (Thanks to GR friend Will Byrnes for posting this NY Times article on the consent agreement reached with the family finally . . . 62 years later. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/sci...)At first I found the structure of the book a little frustrating because it jumped in both time and storyline, but once I decided to just flow with it, I was completely engaged. I think listening helped. It was as if the author was telling her story just to me, and that I was discovering it side-by-side with her. There are so many layers, that my thought is there's something to connect to for everyone based on a reader's interests coming to the book. Skloot reveals early in the book that she learned about HeLa in a biology class when she was younger and decided then and there to research and write about them. Little did she know that she would be telling the story of the Lacks family right along with the scientific importance of the cells. I appreciated the interview at the end of the audio where Skloot tells us how she decided on the focus and the structure of the book. This was the February book club pick at our wonderful art museum here in Minneapolis, and I enjoyed the discussion. I'm eagerly anticipating the HBO movie based on the book which will be aired April 22 here in the States. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5686132/"

It was her cells that helped discover the polio vaccine, DNA mapping, cloning, and so much more. Because of Henrietta, we know how massive doses of radiation affect the human body, and also what cells do in a zero gravity environment. The list of her contributions to science go on and on.Henrietta’s cells were taken without her permission or knowledge in early 1951. More than twenty years would pass before her family ever found out. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is Henrietta’s story, the story of her cell’s contribution to science, and the story of her family. I learned a lot from this book about Henrietta, science, and past and present patient rights in the United States. Some of the information found on these pages are truly alarming. Rebecca Skloot did a thorough and diligent job with her research, and her writing is exceptional. I’m grateful to Rebecca for telling Henrietta’s story!"

I'm grateful to have learned the story of Henrietta Lacks, but the book just wasn't riveting for me.

552,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20015365-may,4,"As a medical student, I was, and still am ashamed, that I knew next-to-nothing about Henrietta Lacks and the HUGE contribution her cells have made to science. The fact that her family can't even get reliable health insurance really just adds insult to injury. This is a well-researched, well-written book. The issue it discusses is extremely important, and the last chapter about tissue ownership is outright terrifying. It was the first time I heard of ""gene patents"" (what?), and this:Myriad Genetics, which holds the patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes responsible for most cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, charges $3,000 to test for the genes. Myriad has been accused of creating a monopoly, since no one else can offer the test, and researchers can’t develop cheaper tests or new therapies without getting permission from Myriad and paying steep licensing fees. Scientists who’ve gone ahead with research involving the breast-cancer genes without Myriad’s permission have found themselves on the receiving end of cease-and-desist letters and threats of litigation.I don't know what to say. I think this paragraph sums it up very well:
The debate over the commercialization of human biological materials always comes back to one fundamental point: like it or not, we live in a market-driven society, and science is part of that market. Baruch Blumberg, the Nobel Prize-winning researcher who used Ted Slavin’s antibodies for hepatitis B research, told me, “Whether you think the commercialization of medical research is good or bad depends on how into capitalism you are.” On the whole, Blumberg said, commercialization is good; how else would we get the drugs and diagnostic tests we need? Still, he sees a downside. “I think it’s fair to say it’s interfered with science,” he said. “It’s changed the spirit.” Now there are patents and proprietary information where there once was free information flow. “Researchers have become entrepreneurs. That’s boomed our economy and created incentives to do research. But it’s also brought problems, like secrecy and arguments over who owns what.”

553,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,5,"This is a phenomenal book. If it doesn't win every non-fiction award for 2010 than whoever votes for non-fiction awards should have their library cards taken away from them*.The author, Rebecca Skloot, does a masterful job of seamlessly weaving in the scientific story of Henrietta Lacks' immortal cells and the effect they have had on medicine and medical ethics with a real human interest story about Henrietta and the struggles of her family. Skloot does this without coming across as maudlin, preachy, overly technical, guilt ridden, condescending, or just plain boring. She deftly weaves two legs of one story together, darting in and out with ease and keeping the reader interested in learning the science and caring about the people. She does this all while doing her best to avoid passing judgment or creating villains. Like a good journalist, she simply reports the facts of a fantastically and seemingly thoroughly researched book and lets the reader interpret them as they will.In all, this is not only a terrific science book that is not afraid to tackle gray areas of ethics and leave them unanswered without getting preachy, not only a gripping human interest story with more than one human we are interested in, but also a socioeconomic look at the educational opportunities and struggles of poor, disadvantaged people across several generations of our country. Most of all though, this is a uniquely American story.*Seeing as how Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World by Liaquat Ahamed won the last Pulitzer for history, perhaps voters should have already had their library cards taken from them because that book was so bad I wouldn't even use it as a doorstop and besmirch the dignity of my door."

Her cells are another story, they continued to live on after biopsies of her cancerous tissue was taken without her permission or her family's knowledge and grown in labs to be shipped around the world to test diseases, develop gene therapy, and ultimately change the world. All the while, her children and family had no idea that this was happening, and they struggle to come to terms with what it means to have immortal cells, while the family can barely afford medical treatment.Rebecca Skloot takes a nearly impossible task of researching something that was breaking at the time, and challenges human rights to our own tissue and most importantly how client consent has changed over the past couple of decades. Fascinating story merging the lines of racial and gender discrimination, while also facing class struggles. In my opinion, this book should be required reading."
556,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9554958-sara,1,"The story behind the infamous ""HeLa"" cells are interesting to most scientists, as most of us have either worked with them, read endless research articles/journals utilizing them, and know about their contributions to science and/or medicine, among many more things. This immortal cell line was derived from Mrs. Lacks' cervical tissue, which became cancerous after she was infected with HPV. She recieved treatment for cervical canver at Johns Hopkins University, known at this time period for treating black patients. Though I don't know how her race/ethnicity/social status affected her personal treatment at the hospital, the actual medical treatment for her condition was unbiased and the normal protocol for any one with the condition. During this time period, research physicians, or physicians who were interetsed in biomedical research were striving to culture an immortal cell line, which has enormous applications and implications in biomedical research. The physicians, with the help of other scientists and technicians, were able to create a cell line that had greatly sought-after conditions for the purposes of biomedical research, inlcuding immortalization and ease of growth in culture. The use of her cells greatly impacted the field of biomedical research, and the cultivation and use of the HeLA cell line contributed to the establishment of the first Polio vaccine, cancer research, and countless other types of research where the characteristics of the HeLa cell line offer great advatange and resource for pusuit of scientific knowledge. My review of this book has nothing to do with the contributions her cells have made to the scientific community. The physicians at the time did take her cells and culture them without her consent, but that was standard protocol at the time, and she was not isolated for that purpose. We have all contributed from the use of her cells, therefore, it is hypocritical to be critical of the use of them.Despite a major attempt to create a ""boogey-man"" portrait of the physicians/scientists that worked with her cells, none of them were awarded financially for establishing the HeLa cell line. The author tries to create an image of a poor black woman who was robbed of her cells without consent and not awarded the enormous monentary prize for their use, but the truth is, this was standard procedure at that time period,and her cells just happened to actually work for that purpose. I was very interested to learn more about Mrs. Lacks in this book. What made this book impossible to read was the author. She hardly writes more than a few pages about Mrs. Lacks. She mostly wrote a biography detailing her attempts at finding information, without providing anything insightful about the actual woman it was supposed to be about, Mrs. Lacks. Most of the book is about her relatives and their immense anger and resentment about not being compensated for the use of Mrs. Lacks' cells. I don't really give a shit about that. A lot of shitty things happen to people in this world, this wasn't in any way the worst, and that would have made a decent book if that was what the book was supposed to be about. This book was so boring, I didn't even finish it. "
557,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"This book has been around for a while now, so most people know the basis. Rebecca Skloot tells the story here of Henrietta Lacks, the poor black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1951. Why do we care about Henrietta Lacks? Quite simply, her cells, which were taken without her knowledge or consent, became known as HeLa cells. Now does it sound familiar? HeLa cells have been around for a while, recognizable to many for their importance in developing the polio vaccine and gene mapping. HeLa cells have survived and grown since 1951.But Skloot recognized there was more to the science than just the letters HeLa. She set out to uncover the truth about the person behind the abbreviation. With the help of members of Lacks's family, Skloot spent about a decade on this book. She visited the now-defunct Clover, where Lacks grew up, she took Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, to the hospital where her sister, Elsie, was put away as an ""imbecile"" and where she died under suspicious circumstances. Deborah, who was four when Henrietta died, was just as committed to finding out the full story about her family as Skloot was.The book bounces around in time, from the 40s and 50s as Skloot detailed Henrietta's life and illness, to ""present day"" of 2009 when the book was published. Skloot's own journey with her research began in the late 90s. She got married and divorced during the writing of this book. She knew Henrietta Lacks was unknown by the public, even though her cells had been such a vital part of medicine and science for decades.The heartbreaking part about this real-life story is that Henrietta's descendants and family knew nothing about the HeLa cells themselves. They were never given any real explanation about the cells, nor were they compensated in any way. The book brings to light a lot of issues, from social to ethical. Most impressive is the concept that all tissue in and on your body belongs to you while it's attached to you, but as soon as it's removed from you, it's not longer ""yours"". You have no rights over it. It can be researched and sold and re-sold and modified and studies. You get no say in whether you want studies on pieces of your body to go towards the cure for cancer or for the creation of atomic bombs or other devices of mass destruction.Years ago I had a cyst removed. Thinking of a Margaret Atwood story, I asked my surgeon (and every subsequent tech and anesthesiologist whom I met prior to surgery) if I could keep my cyst once they excised it. After their initial responses of ""Ew, WHY?"" they told me that would not, could not, should not ever be available to me. ""But it's MINE"" I tried to argue. They claimed liability, and disease (not that I had a disease, but it's jut not sanitary). None of them had read the Atwood story I was referencing, but if they had, they would have been even more adamant that I should be allowed nowhere near the cyst once it had been removed.I've thought about the same thing during a breast biopsy and then more recently, when they removed my thyroid. What are they going to do with it? What I really would like, more than being able to keep these things that have been pulled from my body over the years, is frequent updates about the road my tissues have traveled. Remember in the 90s the popularity of things like adopting a star, or a whale, or a polar bear. You'd get a picture in the mail for the low-cost of whatever, and then a few updates throughout the year about where your whale is and how it is faring.That's what I want with the tissues that have been taken from me. Just a postcard with a picture of what they're doing with my tissues, a little update that says ""ElPa cell was just sold to Norway for the price of 8 million where they will study the effects of cigarette smoking on this tissue taken from your breast in the early 2000s!""As Skloot spent more time with the Lacks family, she became almost a member of the family herself. After the initial periods of suspicion and caution, Skloot was embraced and was called for all the important family births and deaths and other major life experiences. From a personal storytelling point of view, I found that touching, though it wasn't exactly a necessary part of the main story.I suppose really it means that HeLa (Henrietta Lacks) is a part of everyone, brings us all together. She continues to live, and while her family will never see any portion of the proceeds and still have no say over their mother's cells, there's some satisfaction that can be derived from how common the name Henrietta Lacks is now. The woman behind the cells should never be forgotten. Her contributions (that she didn't even know she was making) should be told. She was more than just the abbreviations HeLa.I know everyone has read this book already by this point, but it came up in my little world because I'm now on the Common Reader Committee at the university where I work. At the first meeting, it became obvious that very few of us are actually readers (one went so far as to say he doesn't like to read, which begs the question as to why he was even there). This book was one of my recommendations, even though I hadn't read it yet. My boss read the first six chapters and felt that it would cover a lot of the bases that our university likes to cover, and would appeal to the three main colleges very well by dealing with social justice issues, science and medicine, legality, ethics, and health and wellness.Now that I've read this book on my own I can go back to our meeting next week and say, holy shit guys, this book really does cover ALL the bases. The idea is this would be a book that everyone could read - every student, staff, and faculty member. While the story meanders a bit and gets a bit dry in other places, I think ultimately the story of Henrietta Lacks and her cells will appeal to all readers in the university.But if I hear one more time from anyone ""But are they mature enough for it"" I will scream. College students aren't quite as dumb as everyone likes to think they are. Maybe they're lazy, but cheese and rice, I'm not going to dumb down the Common Reader in concerns that students won't be able to read a book anymore.Plus there's an HBO movie coming out next month based on this book, so if just reading a book isn't incentive enough, maybe Oprah will be.(My other top contenders would be The Handmaid's Tale and March: Book One. Though some on the committee thinks if we give a graphic novel to college students they will think we're giving them ""cartoons"" to read and there may be an uprising. It's fascinating to me how little faculty and staff know the students at their own university. To be fair, those who suggest an uprising are also the ones who don't read, and they claim not to know how to read a graphic novel. Someone asked ""Do you start at the front or the back?"" conflating graphic novels with manga, I believe. This committee will be a long road for me. Someone just put me in charge already.)"
558,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,5,"It reads like good crime fiction. It chronicles the life of the woman whose cancerous tissue became the first tissue in history which could be successfully grown as culture and used in various, and countless, experiments from vaccine research to cloning. Her tissue was so successful in fact that it became virtually immortal, surviving in various environments and proliferating at prodigious rates. Yet, very little was known about the woman herself, her life, her family, her history, and this is what Skloot set out to uncover. What she found out is absolutely stunning from the point of medical ethics, American history and American healthcare. Fascinating. Highly recommended."

560,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27544898-bookishrealm,5,"This book was phenomenal in more ways than one. I knew a little bit about Henrietta Lacks, but I was definitely not aware of the extent to which her family was affected by the use of her sells in modern day biology. It broke my heart to see how her family, deeply rooted in religious beliefs, was broken because they felt as though Henrietta's soul resided in those cells. I have my own personal opinions about the entire concept of doctors taking medical waste for their own advantages. Nevertheless, what I can say about this issue is that it is stories such as the Tuskegee Experiment and the use of Henrietta's cells that have ultimately made the black community hesitant about wanting to go to doctors. I plan to do more research on this topic and it may be a project that I throw myself into. Hopefully I can find more text that really delves into the black community's experience with the medical field. This really opened my eyes to a lot of issues related to the medical field/industry and I can't wait to read more. "

There's a fine line between what is ethically/morally ""right"" and that which infringes on a person's own being and that person's (or family of said person) rights to his/her cells. There are never any correct answers or final conclusions in the world of bioethics...it's an ongoing dispute but one that really caused me to question my own decisions and how they are interpreted."
562,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is required reading for pharmaceutical students at a nearby Oklahoma University where a friend of my daughter goes to college. She told me about this book over Christmas. I can see why it’s required reading. I’m glad it is and I hope it is for medical and research students everywhere.It tells the story of an African American woman, Henrietta Lacks, who went to Johns Hopkins in 1951 for treatment for cervical cancer. Some cancerous cells were removed from her body. This much she knew. The cells were also saved, cultured, and reproduced—without her knowledge or consent—as was common practice at the time. What makes this an amazing story is that Henrietta’s cells have never died from that day until the present, hence the title. They continue to grow and reproduce at a phenomenal rate. They currently exist in laboratories, hospitals and warehouses all over the world; have been used in almost every form of scientific research from the 50’s until now; have gone to space; have been contaminated and caused contamination. The scientific and medical communities owe untold debt to the cells it calls HeLa and yet not one dime of compensation, even in terms of discounted medical care or health insurance has ever been received by any of Henrietta’s numerous descendants. Interestingly enough, they aren’t looking for anything in that way. Now isn’t that refreshing? Rather, in spite of all they have suffered—and indeed this is a book about pain—their focal interest throughout was in finding out what happened to their mother since she died so young, gaining recognition for her and learning what happened to Henrietta’s oldest daughter who died in a ‘hospital for the negro insane’, which was 1950’s terminology.  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks crosses many disciplines and for that reason I expect scientists might skim the vignettes about Henrietta’s children, while those who prefer human interest could find themselves avoiding the technical sections. Virginia Woolf’s Common Readers, however, will positively adore this book! It has everything they look for in the written word. Not only what was just mentioned, but also: the complexities and importance of the ‘tissue issue’, what are the medical, legal, ethical, and other parameters for tissue gathering, storage, research, usage, and compensation. And I commend the author, Rebecca Skloot, a self-proclaimed non-believer for her sensitive handling of the many stressed and stressful events, issues and personalities she encountered concerning matters of faith, morals, and religion.  A very important book to read!  Here is a rather long but fascinating 1998 BBC documentary about Henrietta Lacks and HeLa.  Here is an article which gives some more current info about the Lacks family and the issue of privacy v. tissue donation. "
563,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"Henrietta Lacks, a young African-American mother of five children, died in Baltimore in 1951 from a highly aggressive form of cervical cancer—but more than fifty years after her death, part of her lives on in the form of HeLa, a cell line cultivated from a tissue sample of hers which played a key role in several major scientific and medical breakthroughs. Skloot's book tells Lacks' story, partly to pay tribute to a woman who was forgotten by all but her family for many years despite her importance to medicine; partly in order to examine the complex attendant issues of medical ethics, race and class. Skloot's writing is fluid and accessible, and I learned some things which were shocking though not surprising to me (see the organ retention scandal which broke in Ireland a few years ago). That said, I would have liked for a stronger focus on the ethics and the science aspect of the novel and less on the lives of Lacks' children and other relatives. Skloot's focus on them and on some of the more unpalatable aspects of their lives felt quite voyeuristic to me at points, recounted not because Skloot wanted to examine the effects of the vicious cycle of poverty on people's lives but because it would inject more drama into the book. The author talks at length about the less-than-pure motivations of those who had previously profited from Lacks' cells, and their refusal to compensate Lacks' family in any way, about how she was financing her research with credit cards and student loans—and yet her end-goal was always to acquire a book deal, and her account of her relentless attempts to get in touch with members of the Lacks family made me highly uncomfortable. Much of the latter half of the book dealt with the relationship between Skloot and Deborah, Henrietta Lacks' youngest daughter—again, uncomfortable to read about at several points, and not especially relevant to the book's main thrust. Overall, an interesting read, but I feel that The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks could easily have been edited down to half its length—and focused more on Henrietta because of it."
564,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/925949-jude,5,"it's as if the writer wanted the story the way i would want it, and self-observes the arc of her own education the way i would, so the emotional style resonated at a profound level: a combination of passion, humility & fearlessness that makes me trust the her completely, that makes me grateful she is the person who chose this story - or that it chose her.& then there's the story - the science. the race & class issues, the muck of medical ethics before patients were real people and blackfolk were real patients... that's the warp. The weft is the story of a friendship between two women meeting each other on the edge of both their worlds, brought there by Henrietta: her immortality is not simply a series of cells.the narrators are excellent. the pacing is a tiny bit slow, but that works for the direct quotes - and hearing voices in dialect anchors the story in time and place. The voices in this story - the amount of quoted text & speech- keep this story very immediate - with the feel of a good documentary or good fiction.a joy."

I tell you the premise, and that's the book. It just keeps doubling over itself to tell you the same science, the same sad story of the people it affected, and nothing ever really happens. People say things like ""hold on, are you ready for this?"" and then nothing happens. It's the same information over and over. So I'm going to spoil the whole book for you; Henrietta Lacks was a poor syphilitic black woman who married her cousin, had a bunch of kids, and died very young of an aggressive cancer, the cells of which doctors took samples of without asking and then developed into the first 'immortal' cell line, which went on to be used by scientist and doctors around the world. Her descendants are plagued by poverty and bad health. That's it. Now imagine me telling you different versions of that over and over while I also tell you about how I'm researching and writing about it, dealing with this difficult and suspicious relatives.

568,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"Its a very important story, its unique in its format of that the cells of Henrietta lacks are doing and how it seems that even today nobody understand why or how those cells are even still alive, BUT sadly the actual story of doctors doing something without permission is NOT a unique one, since sadly there are still today patients being used without their knowledge -as it is even stated in the book itself. And i think that especially that is something that should be taking away from this book: This story is important and interesting, but so far not much has changed in the medical field so that this type of thing does not continues to happen without permission from the patients themselves. This book does point out quiet a lot of positive things that happened because and with cells and how it could have never happened without them. Some horrendous things, some wonderful things where achieved thanks to those cells and with that thanks to Henrietta Lacks. And i am defiantly one of the first people to point out that medical advances are necessary and that we still have way to little knowledge and actual solutions for way to man illnesses! But i think that this book also points out two very important things and drives them home quiet nicely: 1. Human tissue was once part of a person!We all should respect that. Yes its important that a lot of different science fields have access to tissue samples. But its also important to remember the people that gave those samples. Be it willingly, unwillingly, during life or after their death, it was once part of a living breathing person! I think a lot of us prefer to ignore that, or try to forget it and i think that is defiantly one thing we all should work on always remembering when we take any kind of medicine without a second thought! 2. there are lot of loopholes legally that should be worked on!All this talk of ""technically it wasn't required"" in this book just made me want to shake someone! What it comes down to in very basic forms -especially in regards of this specific book and the story it tells- is that everyone should be asking for permission. Doctors and scientists should explain in understandable terms what they want and why it could be helpful and i am pretty sure that a lot of people -especially those with illnesses!- will be more than willing to hand out tissue samples for further use! No need to just take them without asking! So why do it?Which brings it all back to the first point: lets not forget all those ""samples"" actually come from someone that is not just there to be a lab-rat!Now the one ""negative"" thing of this book is that i personally didn't really like how the Skloot wrote this book. Some sections felt as if she wanted to get that particular part of the story told and done with as fast as possible and shoved a lot of details and information into a pretty small section and number of pages. And than sometimes she would go on and on about some things for endless number of pages that i personally felt that it wasn't necessary to go on about it for that long. To say it short it is not he best nonfiction writing i have read. BUT its also far from the worst. Its very readable and yes it could have been kept a little shorter, but all in all it was done pretty well in the writing department. of course that is completely personal and some of the reviews i read LOVED the writing, so clearly that part is debatable.If you are interested in this book, defiantly give it a try. If you are going into a scientific field? Defiantly read this!"
569,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,"A book like this makes me realize how important education in general and particularly science education is. Today’s science is yesterday’s magic—for those who don’t understand science, it can seem like very frightening black magic. The story of Henrietta Lacks explores the intersection between science, research, education, capitalism, civil rights, and consent.The major question implicit in this book is whether we have any claim to our own cells after they have been removed from our bodies. Is it ethical to take “discarded” cells—those left over after medical procedures—and do research from them and potentially make money from either the cells or the research. This issue gets us down somewhere in our irrational subconscious—after all, we all “know” enough about voodoo and black magic to know that curses require hair, nail clippings, blood, or other bodily secretions in order to be effective. In many ways, the story of the HeLa cell line traces the history of medical research in the US (and to some extent, other countries), evolving from the exploitation of vulnerable people towards the concept of informed consent. It also traces the history of an African American family, liberated from slavery, but not from poverty and deprivation. The current distrust of science has some real roots in situations like these, where people were used without their knowledge for experimental purposes. But the lack of scientific literacy in the general population helps with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and the prevalence of medical quackery. Witness all the “miracle cures” that people buy into. One older lady that I used to work with was always pouring money into some miracle weight loss scheme or another—it didn’t seem to occur to her that if the method actually worked, it would be front page news on Time magazine, not some obscure ad in the back of a newspaper.We have to seriously question ourselves and our politicians about the quality of our educational systems. Are they being funded? Do we have enough teachers? Can poor children hope to get education equal to that of rich children?As my grandfather used to say, no education is wasted."
570,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"For a non-fiction book about science, this book is pretty interesting. Chapters about genes, cloning and cancer are juxtaposed with chapters about Henrietta's personal life and about the author's interactions with the Lacks family. I think this book would scare a lot of people about how privacy is dealt with as a legal issue in the medical community. The book is about Henrietta Lacks - a woman whose cells live on and on to be experimented with, cloned, put into space, blown up, used to make human-animal and human-plant hybrids, etc. The point of the book is that these cells were taken from her without her knowledge or consent. Today, no one in her family can afford medical care, even though their mother/grandmother's cells are stored by the billions in laboratories around the world. This brings up many interesting points in debates about what rights the medical community has to do procedures 'for the benefit of humankind' vs. the rights of the individual and patient. Do your cells and tissues belong to you? Do they still belong to you, even when removed from your body? It is surprising how fuzzy the laws still are on this issue. The book also touches a little bit on racism - Henrietta was black, and the doctors who took and distributed her cells were white. But racism isn't the main focus. I found this book fascinating - and cell research isn't really my forte. I recommend this book, even to people who generally don't read or like non-fiction."
571,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,5,I read this book back in 2013 just before I joined Goodreads. I found my review on Audible and decided to add it to Goodreads for my records.This is a well written non-fiction book that provides back ground information about unfair treatment of minorities by medical research. Cassandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin did a great job with the narration of the book. The story of Henrietta Lacks and her family is interesting and the discovery and care of the Hi La cells. One major item about the family is the lack of education that played a major role in their understanding and ability to control the situation. The book accomplishes its goal of promoting proper documentation of biological tissue research. It raises the question of ownership of our own tissues and whether or not we have proprietary rights to our bodies in situ or in vitro. This question needs to be answered NOW not in the future. The other teaching of the book was how important education is to each individual. This is an absolute must read book for everyone on this planet. 
572,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,3,"This was definitely much more than just your average popular science book. Never have a I read a non-fiction book that is so multi-faceted - science, superstition, ethics, family troubles, violence, estrangement, racism - what a cocktail! Full review soon."
573,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5447027-ayelet-waldman,5,Holy shit this book is awesome.
574,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"I blew through this fascinating audiobook, practically manufacturing housework to do so that I'd have an excuse to plug myself in (okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration; there was plenty of housework to do without my having to manufacture any). I would recommend this book to just about anyone seeking a great read -- even if you're usually more of a fiction person, this non-fiction book offers plenty of interesting characters and storylines as well as being informative and provocative in the way of non-fiction.Did you know that much of medical research (and the benefits we derive every day, including many routine vaccines and medications we take for granted) is dependent on a culture of human cells that continue to live and reproduce even after their original owner died in 1951? Well, I didn't. And I wouldn't have thought that this factoid would interest me particularly, not being much of a science person myself. But somehow, Rebecca Skloot was able to make the dynamics surrounding these cells not only comprehensible to me but intriguing (no small feat). Even more intriguing, though, was the story of the late human being behind these cells, Henrietta Lacks, who never knew that her cells had been taken for research. Henrietta's surviving children, tragically losing their mother at a young age to cervical cancer and raised in a poor and abusive environment, only learned about this later in life and never saw a penny of the proceeds.""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" contains several stories. There is the story of Henrietta, a poor young African American woman with incurable cervical cancer, and of her children struggling to grow up without her after her early death. There is the story of the doctor who decided to slice off pieces of her tumor just prior to her death without asking or even informing her, who then discovered that these cancerous cells were immortal. There is the story of the cells, which began to be mass-produced and distributed to researchers for a wide variety of interesting and often ground-breaking experiments. And there is the story of Rebecca Skloot, a journalist who was persistent and dogged in her efforts to win Henrietta's family's reluctant trust (after they had been duped by others attempting to capitalize on Henrietta) so that she could learn and tell their story.Henrietta's adult children in this book are colorful characters with their own stories who overcame some difficult situations, some more successfully than others. We also meet different doctors and researchers -- while some prove to be profiteers, others are truly dedicated to science for its own sake. The doctor who originally took Henrietta's tumor for research without her knowledge fell into the latter category, which is part of what makes this a three-dimensional book rather than a simplistic polemic. A product of his times, this 1950s doctor was less sensitive to the medical and research ethics which have since received more attention, particularly when it came to a poor African-American woman. Should you care if someone uses your body tissues for medical research without your consent? Before I began reading this book, my thought was, why the heck would I care? Assuming that these tissues need to be removed in any case, why not use them to do some good for science and for mankind? But Rebecca offers some anecdotes which complicate this question, and the irony running throughout the book is that Henrietta's descendants cannot afford decent medical care, even as the entire medical profession benefits from Henrietta's unwittingly donated cells.Even if you think you're not a science person, even if you think you're not a non-fiction person, I would recommend checking this book out."
575,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"On the threshold between medicine and ethics.This book talks about ethical and legal conflicts, historically raised by the discovery of immortal cells that changed medicine and patients life's for the better. It‘s an astonishing story you probably didn‘t hear about before:In 1951 a colored poor woman named Henrietta Lacks walked into the Hopkins University, where a doctor extracted cells from her large cervix tumor, that killed her briefly after. But as they discovered in the laboratory, those were anything but normal cells, but the first immortal human cells grown in culture. They are still alive today and were replicated to millions and spread to laboratories all over the world, though Lacks has been dead for more than sixty years. They called them HeLa cells and they were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. What interested me the most was the scientific and legal part of that book. Ultimately it‘s a question of property and if we have the right on our cells, once they leave our body, particularly if we don‘t know about it.First there is the problem with uninformed consent. Henrietta did not provide informed consent for her cells to be used, she didn‘t have knowledge. Beyond that people were later unknowingly injected with her tumor cells, for the purpose of medical research. The same was performed on healthy prisoners with their knowledge, though their free consent seems to be questionable. They developed tumors, sometimes killing them. Furthermore her autopsy report was later published in the book of a journalist, the family didn‘t knew about and didn‘t want to see published. The question is the violation of privacy rights.The second problem are genetic rights/non-rights. Her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later, and didn‘t fully approve of it‘s usage A big focus also are patents and profits for biologic material.Henrietta and her family were very poor and didn’t even have health insurance. They received zero profits, while her cells sell for multiple-millions until today.Very shocking are also racism claims. Because the cells were discovered in the 50, making public that white people were treated with cell stems of a black woman would have had a major impact. Additionally implications are made, that colored people were categorically abused, abducted, purposely infected and killed to perform medical experiments. The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications, but actual, valuable people and historic events.What I didn’t like just as much though, is how the story is told at times, jumping between characters and writing styles; sometimes loosing the silver lining. The writing is very simple and doesn’t at all feel factual. As a non fiction fan, I miss that at times but I guess that others appreciate it even more. It reads a lot like a novel, particularly since a lot of content is told through conversations. In conclusion a super interesting story I won’t forget quickly!"
576,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna,5,"What a wonderful book! It describes the life of Henrietta Lacks and her family, the origin of the HeLa cell line (the first human immortal cell line), the research conducted with these cells, and also the author’s research and interviews in unfolding this story.“I’ve tried to imagine how she’d feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. I’m pretty sure that she—like most of us—would be shocked to hear that there are trillions more of her cells growing in laboratories now than there ever were in her body.” "
577,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1295401-diane-chamberlain,5,"Can't wait to recommend this book to my bookclub. It will make for a fabulous discussion. This book can satisfy several audiences on several different levels. The technical information about the science of cells is fascinating. The ethical questions raised by the unauthorized use of someone's cells are important to ask and ponder. But most fascinating is the story of the Lacks family. Skloot's exhaustive research spanned a decade and she tells a story that is honest, heart wrenching and provocative. "
578,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl,5,"This is one stellar piece of nonfiction that has a bit of everything in it for everybody. Beautifully written and structured because it is clear that while there's SOoo much information here, it is arranged in such a way that you don't get lost. Sure the author is a science writer, but she's also a creative nonfiction writer so the book doesn't read like a nonfiction textbook, and has the plot structure of fiction. Some chapters tell the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family, others take you on the research journey with Rebecca Skloot. The interactions she has with the family makes for light, sometimes humorous reading. In fact, the chronology is done in a way to make the book more interesting. The book is as much about family, as it is about science, history, racial tensions, and of one extraordinary black woman who has done more for medical research and advancements, than anything or anyone the industry has seen. It will have you crying, laughing, yelling at people...you name it. Born in 1920, Henrietta Lacks was thirty years old when she went to see a doctor for ""spotting"" and pain, and started getting treatments for cervical cancer (mind you, in the ""colored"" wards of John Hopkins. This was during the Jim Crow era). The researcher/doctor who treated her, collected samples of her cells (without her knowledge) while he placed radium inside of her. She soon deteriorated and each time she went in for treatment, her cells were taken and stored. Yet she knew nothing of the cells growing in a lab, or the fact that she was now infertile because of her cancer treatment. When she died, her husband signed paperwork to have an autopsy performed, because he was under the impression that doctors would find out if his children were predisposed to whatever his wife had, not knowing that his signature allowed his wife's body to be cut open to help with more research.This is the breadth of the story I think. A story about an African-American woman whose life and death seemed to be an irony--she wasn't allowed to mention her white, slave-owning family, yet she was buried next to them. She wasn't allowed to use the ""white-only"" medical facilities, yet her cells were mixed with white cells. In science cell culture, there were no other cells with the ability to multiply and stay immortal like hers. So every major medical breakthrough, like polio vaccine for example, came from the usage of her cells. The main thrust is, she didn't know. Her family didn't know, and they didn't find out until twenty years later because the name Henrietta Lacks was hidden by the doctors who used her cells as research. Scientists made millions from her body and her family had tons of health issues, with no help from their mother's cells and no health insurance. ""A search of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database turns up more than seventeen thousand patents involving HeLa Cells,"" Skloot wrote. But Henrietta's son Lawrence wanted to know, ""She's the most important woman in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""There they were, at a time when the country was learning about the ""Tuskegee Syphilis Study"" (where African-American men with syphilis were recruited for research, then made to die slow, painful deaths even after their researchers realized that penicillin would cure them), and cells from a black woman was being used to save millions of Americans, mostly white.In this book, Skloot brings the woman behind the cells to life, talks about her life, her troubled marriage, her children. She develops a relationship with Deborah, Henrietta's daughter who suffered the most from all of it. She talks to scientists and researchers. She brings in history. She talks about race tensions and shows how when slavery was abolished, African-Americans became slaves to another master: medicine. I'll admit, at times it was an emotional roller coaster for me, but one quote from Deborah stood out for me and should for you:""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different.""So anybody should be able to read this book because the way in which it is written, is not to point fingers (not even at the medical industry because the author manages to explain those times as well) but to glean the truth. To finally give credit where credit is due, and to educate. To honor a woman, a mother, a wife, whose body makes it possible for us to get some of the modern medical treatments that we get today. This is one book I will remember, that's for sure! "
579,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon,4,"In 1951, Henrietta Lacks passed away due to complications arising from cervical cancer. Following her death, cancerous cells were harvested from her body and used in ongoing experiments regarding the growth of cells outside the human body. Previous to Henrietta, scientists could only make it a few days before the cells would ultimately die, forcing them to start all over. Henrietta’s cells were different, they grew at an astounding rate and researchers were able to keep them alive. Since the discovery, they've been used in countless experiments and led to numerous scientific breakthroughs - most notably the polio vaccine.Today, Henrietta’s cells usually go for a few hundred dollars a vial but her descendants live in poverty. While many of her children believe they should be compensated for the sale of HeLa cells, court cases involving similar claims have always found in favor of research companies rather than individuals - the argument being that once a procedure is performed and tissue is removed from a body, it is no longer of use to the individual and the hospital can do with it as it pleases, be it incineration or study. On one hand, it makes sense given that it was highly doubtful Henrietta’s husband could have opened a cellular research facility, however, the problem lies within the fact that researchers did not tell Henrietta’s family about the importance of HeLa cells and lied to her children when additional bloodwork was requested for further study.The story of the Lacks family is a heartbreaking one. Henrietta had a terrible upbringing and following her death, things became that much worse for her children. While the book mainly concentrates on the HeLa cells, there’s a shocking piece on her daughter Elsie, who had been diagnosed with “idiocy” and institutionalized at Crownsville Hospital Centre (a.k.a. The Hospital for the Negro Insane) following her mother’s death. The conditions at the time of Elsie’s arrival were deplorable. They had a total of eight attendants (four in the day, four in the evening) for five hundred and sixty patients. One ward in particular had seventy eight patients with only twenty eight beds. There were also only three toilets to share amongst them all. You can imagine how much this upset the family when they found out decades later.While The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks can be deeply upsetting, it is without a doubt an important book. Author Rebecca Skloot spent years interviewing the Lacks family (which at times was certainly no easy task) and researching Henrietta’s life and death, all information that had been buried over time. The story flows well and her afterword provides greater insight into the legal ramifications of future soft tissue research. Henrietta’s youngest daughter Deborah always wanted the world to know about the person behind the HeLa cells, the real human being who provided the ammunition for several medical discoveries. Thanks to Rebecca’s tireless work, Henrietta Lacks' incredible true story is out there for the world to see.Also posted @ Every Read Thing."

Some people comment on the human interest aspect of the story with regard to the Lacks family. Other people mention the cell science. For me, the most interesting thing was the history of informed consent, or the ""Lacks"" thereof. (Go ahead and laugh now at my clever wordplay. You know you want to.)It's hard to believe the bizarre ways people's bodies were used for medical research, with or without their consent. Even when they did give consent, they did so without being told exactly what would be done to their bodies. Too often the people used for the studies were the poor, the uneducated, and prison inmates. Back in the forties and fifties, ""Many scientists believed that since patients were treated for free in the public wards, it was fair to use them as research subjects as a form of payment."" YIKES! That's not just unethical, it's abominable.Rebecca Skloot's dedication to the research and writing of this story is remarkable. She spent pretty much the entire decade of her twenties in pursuit of the truth about Henrietta Lacks and her ""immortal"" cells. My only reason for not awarding the full five stars is that I thought the book could have used one more ruthless edit before final printing. "

Clearly, a result of hard work and intense research and, above all the fact that the author has taken student loans and used her credit cards for the research work and had no other backing or support.

586,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66292681-sarah-lumos,4,"  “Henrietta’s (cells) were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.”  Argh, I feel embarrassed admitting this, but before reading this book, I had no idea what the HeLa cells were. I never studied science in-depth, which is now one of my biggest regrets. However, I guess in some ways I was lucky: I got to know who Henrietta Lacks was before meeting her famous cells. In this well-researched biography, Rebecca Skloot tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, a poor Black woman who was only 31 when she died from cervical cancer. While she was getting treatments at John Hopkins Hospital, Dr. George Guy took cells from Lack’s tumor without her consent. After examining her cells, Guy felt amazed. He realized her cells were unlike any he had seen - Henrietta’s cells refused to die.HeLa would become the first immortal cell line grown in a lab. For scientists, this discovery was monumental. It would allow them to conduct experiments they never could before. Henrietta’s cells would later help create in vitro fertilization, polio vaccines, and cancer treatments. Although HeLa cells have affected each of us in different ways, before this book’s publication, most of us had little to no idea who Henrietta Lacks was.Here is what I found riveting: Henrietta never graduated from high school, yet she became one of the most important people in science. Sure, science has its own explanation for how this happened, but her family believed God chose Henrietta. God wanted her to come back to Earth in the form of her cells to help others. Since the Lacks had a weak science background, faith was their way of understanding what happened to Henrietta, and making sense of the non-sensical. Though most of the Lacks were happy Henrietta’s cells were advancing science, some of them were mad. The Lacks had no science education, and scientists never bothered to explain to them what happened to Henrietta in a simple way. Researchers exploited their ignorance and the Lacks were never able to give informed consent. Their frustrations are understandable. I felt like giving each of them a hug when I read these passages. If I were them, I would be upset too. While HeLa cells were becoming a multi-million dollar industry, the Lacks were living in poverty, barely able to afford health insurance:   “...the last thing he remembered before falling into unconsciousness under anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened to medicine. Sonny woke up more than $125,000 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery.”  I also admire Skloot's grit because this was a massive project to undertake. I can understand why this book took her a decade to write. I think she wanted to do Henrietta's story justice, and she did. Skloot made sure the world knew about the Lacks and what they did for science. Furthermore, I liked that Skloot’s discussed the social determinants of health. Her clear prose helped me better understand patient rights, inequalities in medicine, informed consent, and tissue ownership laws. Overall, “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" was a magnificent treat. I am positive other readers will find this book as informative and awe-inspiring as I did."
587,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Skloot delivers a mix of science history and human interest in her journalistic style. She discusses medical ethics particularly the issue of informed consent as she tells the story of Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta was a poor black woman who joined the great migration of the 1940’s moving from rural southern Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. She was treated for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins, the only nearby hospital that would admit blacks in 1951. After suffering through the then standard radium therapy, she died that same year. Samples of her tumor were removed and became the first successful human cell culture to sustain itself. Known as HeLa her cells live on today in labs around the world the subject of endless experimentation. Most of the book is spent on Henrietta’s life, her daughter Deborah, their families and extended relations as well as the author’s work with the family to research the book. We follow Henrietta from her childhood in the 1920’s growing up in former slave quarters on the wrong side of the tracks in the small tobacco country town of Clover, Virginia. Skloot gives a somewhat romanticized version of what must have been a harsh life of poverty and discrimination. Similarly Skloot tries to bring out the positives while dutifully reporting the difficult lives of Henrietta’s descendants who suffer from chronic mental and physical illnesses, limited education and continued discrimination in the Baltimore area. Particularly interesting to me was the communication gap between the scientists and Henrietta’s working class African American family. A big part of the problem was the history of exploitation of African Americans by white doctors and their medical institutions. This history had been internalized into a pervasive distrust of doctors and hospitals by Henrietta’s family. Henrietta’s and her family’s fear is understandable and it struck me as part of a broader issue. With unarmed black men dying regularly at the hands of the police, we see similar fears by African Americans today. Skloot points out that scientific progress was made from practices that now would be clearly unethical. Henrietta’s cells sped up the development of the Polio vaccine in the early 1950’s saving many from this devastating disease. Concepts such as informed consent did not exist in 1951. Even today the issue is very murky which the author addresses in her afterword. At the end of the book Skloot returns to Clover to find it gone. All the ramshackle old buildings torn down, just empty fields remaining. Most of those who knew Henrietta had now passed on too. Only her cells remain, thriving in labs everywhere and generating the ground breaking medical discoveries of a new era. "
588,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2528841-claire,5,"In the same way we sometimes debate whether the story should be seen as an entirely seperate entity to the writer, so too do scientists perceive a sample of cell tissue as seperate to the human body it was extracted from. Except that it is not possible to extract a story from a writer's imagination without their consent. Henrietta Lacks was a young mother in her early thirties when she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer that would quickly take her life. She was fortunate to live close to the John Hopkins hospital, set up to ensure equal access to medical care for all' no matter their race, status, income or any other characteristic that might have otherwise given cause to discriminate.Before undergoing treatment, one of the Doctors took a tissue sample of her healthy cells and the cancerous cells, as he had been doing to most patients, in an effort to try and find cells that would continue to replicate without dying - the elusive ""immortal"" cell. It had never been done successfully with human cells before.He succeeded and the cells became known the world over as he gave them away freely, known as HeLa cells, the immortal human cells that never died and could be used over and over again to test for cures to disease and to observe how cells react to numerous variables, furthering science in ways unimaginable previously. Few paused to ask who the woman behind these cells was, what was her story, how did her family feel about this multi million dollar research industry that was making great strides in science yes, and also making entrepreneurial types wealthy in the process.Rebecca Skloot made Henrietta the subject of her research for 10 years in the creation of this thorough, respectful account of the life of Henrietta Lacks and her journey to uncover the events of the time within the context of what was the norm in her day. In much of it she is accompanied by Henriettas daughter Deborah, a passionate woman who was unable to find peace in her own life, until she had helped bring her mother's story to light.A brilliant and informative story and piece of scientific medical history that reads like a novel and brings our awareness to the many who unknowingly make sacrifices for the better of others and that always present aspect of those hovering in the wings, recognising an opportunity to profit."

The votes have been in for years: author Rebecca Skloot’s book racked up 19 significant awards and citations in 2010 when it was first published. The 2011 trade paperback edition I read boasts five pages of exuberant blurbs before you even get to the title page. I wanted to be a curmudgeon about it, but the story is so serious that I had to relinquish my pissy attitude. It is just that type of story: a sensational true crime story with ramifications in the fields of health and science; race and sociology; ethics, history, and journalism. Suspenseful, cinematic, and factual, Ms. Skloot manages to pack it all inside of 310 pages, with 71 pages remaining for appendices, acknowledgements, notes, and discussion group questions! She writes knowledgeably, intelligently, compassionately, and skillfully. This book is all that! The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family. It is about the miraculous and immortal cells---taken from her cervix without her permission in 1951 and how they have been serving medical research ever since. It is a story about her daughter, Deborah, and a science journalist (Rebecca Skloot) dedicating years of her life to questioning, investigating, researching, and writing. It is about injustice and justice; human liberties, and privileging science over human life and the right to make informed decisions. This book chillingly illustrates the complex path of ethics and medical research in the United States from the 1950s to the present. It made me mad, but it also educated me in a profound way."

In fact this is the first book to keep me so intellectually and emotionally engaged in a very long time. I struggle to find the words to express what it meant to read about the plight of this woman and the medical knowledge gained from her cells. To read this book is to begin to understand the impact of these cells on modern medicine. Then the book takes you further to read about what has happened to her family during these medical breakthroughs, the impact of what happened and its influences on the laws and the practice of medicine. Just an amazing book with so many elements intertwined and presented with such empathy and beauty. As a brief aside, shortly after I finished the book I had a minor medical procedure performed. Before they would begin, the patient must sign a medical release form and on the form was a statement asking the patient to relinquish all rights of ownership to any tissue samples removed. After reading this book I understand the implications (signed it, but was much more aware of the rationale behind it). This was a life affecting book for me. I didn't close the book thinking that I knew the answers to the ethical questions it raised. What I did feel was that it just seemed some how unjust that her family fared so poorly when her cells were so vital to so many of the scientific advancements made after her death. It presented legal and ethical quandaries that some of the finest legal minds still haven't wrapped their minds around. Engaging and enlightening book? And how!! Highly recommended!!!"

As someone who is strongly considering donating my body to science when I die, this was a probative read to think about the changing ethics of medicine, and a reminder that so much scientific development has been done on unwilling, non-consenting, and uninformed individuals. Top among these unwitting contributors, must rank Henrietta Lacks, whose indomitable cancer cells have led to inestimable developments. Though the ethics have tissue collection has drastically changed since the 1950s, it is surprising how much of a wild, wild west this area remains. As a teacher, I would make this work assigned reading to every biology and medical student. "

“Everybody in the world got her cells, only thing we got of our mother is just them medical records and her Bible.”
In 1951 doctors at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore diagnosed an unusually extreme case of cervical cancer. The breakneck growth rate and resistance to common remedies were unlike anything previously seen. Without informed consent, the doctor scraped a clump of cells from the cancerous tumor during one of the 30 year-old woman’s visits and deposited them with a nearby cell culture lab operated by George Gey. There, in the air-controlled space of Gey’s facility, something happened that researchers had long suspected out of reach. Where countless other cells before them had died, hers survived, and multiplied indefinitely. The immortality of this one cell line would prove instrumental in treating a number of the world’s most heavy-hitting diseases and set the stage for an all new era in cell research, medical diagnosis, drug development and bioethics. But this is a story not just about bundles of cells, but about the humanity behind them, and in particular the family to which they will forever be tied.That woman was Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta passed away just nine months after diagnosis, but it would be more than two decades before her family received word of the namesake cell line which survived her—HeLa. Its value as a scientific and commercial commodity was paramount, getting bogged down in the thicket of rights and privacy less so. Once researchers discovered that Henrietta’s cells did not die but instead bred a new generation every twenty-four hours, HeLa quickly became the tireless workhorse of the culture community. Vials were trucked to research facilities around the world, where they were regularly exposed to a pavilion of infectious diseases, merged with non-human DNA, and even shot into space in an effort to study the influence of zero gravity.Over time, details about the parent of the eponymous cells funneled out of view. Henrietta’s own kin were oblivious to the fact that her cells lived, were being studied and tested in dozens of countries, and were being exchanged at great profit. Once the unwitting donor’s official name was released, journalists descended in full fervor, leading to a lifetime of turmoil and unrest for the Lacks household. Set against the rich legacy of the family’s cells, their life of poverty and unpaid medical bills seemed untoward by comparison, and this sense of injustice only mounted as more details filtered in from the press.Rebecca Skloot’s segue into this lush narrative was by and large a product of serendipitous circumstance, having first heard of HeLa in an intro to biology course at her local community college. After learning that these cells had lived outside their host's body for the better part of a century, and about the remarkable advances they have gifted to science, Skloot shot up her hand and innocently asked, ""Who was she?"" The professor's reply proved unsatisfying: ""An African American woman."" The seed of curiosity had been planted. By the time Skloot graduated she'd decided to write a book to recover the disremembered woman whose cells had won so many victories for science and society.Who Was Henrietta Lacks?For more than a decade, Skloot layered herself into the Lacks’ story, befriending and forming deep bonds with Henrietta’s children and cousinry. She forges an especially strong connection with Deborah Lacks, Henrietta’s youngest daughter, who was unfortunately too young to remember much about her mother. With a mix of patience and persistence the two work together to dig up Henrietta’s heritage and bring to light her hitherto uncelebrated legacy. It is Skloot’s at times unstable relationship and camaraderie with Deborah that gives the narrative its steam, as the two probe ever deeper into the mystery surrounding her mother.Tracing the family’s roots places Henrietta’s childhood at the tail end of the Jim Crow era, a time when segregation meant a great deal more than which bathroom and water fountain one was required to use. Rampant legal disadvantages in the South bred systemic, institutionalized maladjustment for blacks, and this included limited access to medical care. Having spent her youth on a slave plantation in Clover, Virginia, Henrietta joined in the Great Migration at the ripened age of twenty-one, exchanging her familiarity with tobacco fields for a new life in Baltimore. Nine years later, she would be diagnosed with the malignancy that led to her iconic cell line. And it would be another fifty years before Deborah, with the help of Skloot, laid eyes on her mother’s original medical records.Johns Hopkins Hospital was founded for the express purpose of treating Baltimore's poor and, unlike today, informed consent upon providing blood or tissue samples was neither required by law nor common practice (the term did not even appear in a court document until 1957). Like everyone at the time, Henrietta hadn't a clue about what would become of her excised genetic material and the boons it would lavish upon the scientific community. This became a flashpoint issue in the years that followed as the occasional patient attempted to turn a gray area into a lucrative venture. While we learned more about DNA and transmissible disease, Henrietta's resilient cells inaugurated an international conversation on the commercialization of biological materials and where exactly the donors fit within that ecosystem. In many ways, the conversation is ongoing. (Skloot includes a superb summary in the afterword which draws together the various threads of this nuanced debate.) The HeLa LegacyTo properly gauge the vastitude of the legacy tied up in Henrietta’s cells, it’s important to understand 20th century cell culture. Until Henrietta came along, cell immortality was a pipe dream. While standard, non-cancerous cells had been grown in vitro since 1907, none of them survived long enough to endure important testing, petering out after 50 divisions, on average. Even cancer cells, like those common to cervical cancers, died shortly after relocation to the culture environment. This meant not only was there a brief window for experimentation but that a continuous supply of fresh cells was needed to sustain research. Many in the field yearned for a better way.HeLa keynoted a paradigm shift. They were robust enough to survive in the bricolage of materials used in Dr. Gey’s culture medium, and they were susceptible to the same range of infectious diseases as were normal cells. This allowed researchers to inject the lively DNA with diseases as well as cures. Not merely a boon to science, this revolutionized the field, so much so that one of the researchers Skloot interviews in the book, when asked what would happen if HeLa was pulled from research use, replied, “Restricting HeLa cell use would be disastrous. The impact that would have on science is inconceivable.” (p. 328)Thanks to Dr. Gey’s partnering efforts with labs around the globe, the benefits of HeLa manifested seemingly overnight. In just one year after HeLa’s genesis, Jonas Salk and his team were able to derive a vaccine for polio by infecting HeLa cells, followed shortly by drug treatments for HPV, herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia and Parkinson’s disease. In 1953 HeLa became the first cells to be cloned successfully. In total, some 60,000 papers have been published on HeLa, and cell culturists still use her cancer cells as a model for human biology.What was it exactly that gave HeLa cells their added dose of moxie? Even today, we can only speculate. We now know that Henrietta was infected with both HPV and syphilis, so one theory is that this virulent combination may have helped suppress PCD. A rival theory suggests she had highly atypical genes to begin with, perhaps a rare mutation, that enabled the cancer to spiral in unspecified directions. We still are uncertain. HeLa has also been the source of much frustration over the years from regularly contaminating other cell lines, often halting research until the botch-up is sorted.Closing ThoughtsRebecca Skloot’s ten-year effort is a literary and cultural marvel balanced between unsheathing the posthumous success and humanity behind one of the richest narratives in science and laying bare the bioethical implications to which it is attached. It succeeds on both fronts. Skloot is at her most animating when channeling the lens of Deborah Lacks as they band together to reach some much-needed closure to the saga thrust upon the Lacks family. With her first book, Skloot has demonstrated in equal measure her facility for conveying scientific nuance while weaving meaning and poetic force into a cohesive whole. Yes, this is first and foremost a work of nonfiction, but its pages are emblazoned with enough touches of novel-like charisma to beckon both crowds. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a timeless story delivered by a gifted writer and the definitive presentation of the legacy Henrietta never lived to see. Highly recommended.Skloot also founded The Henrietta Lacks Foundation - click here for more - to provide support for the Lacks as well as assistance to African Americans pursuing education in science and medicine. A portion of her book’s proceeds are donated to the Foundation.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."
595,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7983564-kaora,4,"A really powerful read about HeLa cells, taken without consent from a woman named Henrietta Lacks. Her cells contributed to many of modern medicines discoveries, including the polio vaccine and gene mapping, and yet her family is still so poor they cannot afford health care hacing seen none of the money generated by these cells.This book explores the debate about what makes up a person's body. Is a shed skin cell the property of the person whose DNA is within the cell, or have they given up their ownership? And what exactly constitutes informed consent?I thought it was a fascinating read, and while it appealed to my Science background by explaining the advances made, and the complications that arose, it also brought to light the bittersweet story of the family that thought they had lost their mother, and never knew that a little piece of her still existed until years after her death.A powerful read I'd recommend to everyone."
596,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101060033-woman-reading,4,"In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (ILHL), Skloot blends the Lacks' family history with that of medical sciences and all against a backdrop of systemic racism. For decades, her cell line, named HeLa, has far eclipsed the woman of their origin. Henrietta Lacks was born in 1920 as the ninth child of Eliza and Johnny Pleasant in Roanoke, Virginia. When Eliza died after birthing her tenth child in 1924, the family was divided amongst the larger network of relatives who pitched in to raise the children. Henrietta and David Lacks, her first cousin and future spouse, were raised together by their grandfather Tommy in a former slaves quarter cabin in Lacks Town (Clover), Virginia. Lacks Town had been the inheritance carved out of Henrietta's white great grandfather Albert Lacks' tobacco plantation in the late 1800s.From Skloot's interviews with relatives, Henrietta was a generously hospitable, hard working, and loving mother whose premature death led to enormous consequences for her children. Henrietta suspected a health problem a year before her fifth and last child was born. She went to Johns Hopkins, a renowned medical institution and a charity hospital, in Baltimore and received a diagnosis of cervical cancer in January 1951. (view spoiler)[Since cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, it seems likely that she had contracted the virus from her husband, who had not been monogamous. (hide spoiler)]During her first treatment for cancer, malignant cells were removed - without Henrietta's knowledge - and cultivated in a lab environment by Johns Hopkins researchers attempting to uncover cancer's secrets. Although the brachytherapy with radium was initially deemed a success, Henrietta's brown skin turned black as the cancer aggressively metastasized. After several weeks of great pain, Henrietta died in October 1951.ILHL raises questions about the extent to which we own our bodies, informed consent, and ethics surrounding the research of anything human. The HeLa line was a rare scientific success as those malignant cells thrived in lab conditions and eventually became crucial to thousands of research projects. Skloot reported that in 2009, an average human body was worth anywhere from $10,000 to $150,000. In the case of John Moore who had leukemia, his cell line was valued in millions of dollars. To prevent human trafficking, it is illegal to sell human organs and tissues, but they can be donated while processing fees are assessed.As a charity hospital in the 1950s, segregated patient wards in Johns Hopkins were filled with African Americans whose tissue samples were regarded by researchers as ""payment."" One cannot ""donate"" what one doesn't know. The Lacks family discovered HeLa's existence 22 years after Henrietta died. They've struggled to pay their medical costs while biotechnology companies have reaped profits from cultivating and selling HeLa cells. In 1999, the Rand Corporation estimated that 307 million tissue samples from  178 million  people (almost 60 percent of the population) were stored in the US for research purposes. Although the US is nowhere close to definitively addressing the questions raised by ILHL , a little progress has been made. In 1974, the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects (the ""Common Rule"") required informed consent for federally funded research. The Common Rule was passed in response to egregious and inhumane experiments such as the Tuskegee Syphilis project and another scientist who wanted to know whether injecting people with HeLa would give them cancer. Note that this rule exempts privately funded research. In 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) made it illegal for health practitioners and insurers to make one's medical information public without their consent. This was after researchers had published medical information about the Lacks family. It should be evident that human tissues have long been monetized. One method of creating monopoly - like control has been to obtain a patent. As of 2005, the US has issued patents for about 20 percent of all known human genes. Myriad Genetics patented two genes - BRCA1 and BRCA2 - indicative of breast and ovarian cancer. In 2009 the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), on behalf of scientists, sued Myriad Genetics. In 2013, the US Supreme Court gave the victory to the ACLU and invalidated the patents, thus lowering future research costs and obliquely taking a step toward defining ownership of the human body."

After the birth of her son, she only grew sicker. At John Hopkins, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer and underwent treatment. Unfortunately, the cancer spread quickly and Henrietta died. Before her death, a sample of her cancerous tissue was taken and cultivated in the lab. Her cells grew at an unprecedated rate and became extremely valuable to the scientific realm. Called HeLa, Henrietta's cells were the first to reach ""immortality"". Her family did not know this information for several years. This is the story of the woman behind the cells.I began reading more non-fiction books last year and have since come across some amazing works. 'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' will join those ranks. Hands down, this is one of the best non-fiction books written. Broad-in-scope, thought-provocking, awe-inspiring and jaw-dropping, this book is the perfect marriage between science and human interest. Greatly researched and with much heart, the prose is magnificent. Henrietta Lacks was a poor tobacco farmer, descended from slaves. When she was diagnosed with cervical cancer, she did not particularly stand out but when her cancerous tissue was cultivated in the Hopkins lab, that was a different story. Until HeLa, scientists had not been able to produce a cell line that perdured. With HeLa cells, however, they hit the jackpot. Used in everything from the development of vaccines to genetic research and even to test out the effects of a nuclear bomb, the impact of these cells is immesurable. Just one problem, Henrietta did not give consent to give her cells and her family did not learn of just how important Henrietta was until many years after her death. About 50 miillion metric tons of HeLa cells have been produced to date, more than enough cells to populate a village full of Henriettas. While Henritta never travelled far form her home, her cells have been all over the world and even into outer space. They have been infected with several illnesses and combined with other cells. Odds are eah of us has, in some way, come in contact with HeLa.The way in which Skloot balances the science aspect with the human asprct of the book is done with finnesse. The HeLa cells are something impressive but more so is the woman behind them. Henrietta was strong, confident and resourceful. By all accounts, she faced her cancer diagnosis with sheer bravery and never stopped thinking about her family, even when she knew she would not survive. Its truly sad that for that Henriettas's cells did for the world, her heirs do not even know where the exact location of her grave is. What stood out for me most was the relationship that developed between Sloot and Deborah (Henrietta's daughter). Until Skloot, most were merely interested in the cells with Henrietta as an afterthought. I love that Skloot focused on Henrietta. Its time she gets the recognition that is way overdue.This work raises many questions. With the ""Tissue Issue"", consent and scientific progress are at a standstill. Henrietta's cells were taken without her knowledge or that of her family. The exact amount of money made off the HeLa cells is not known but its exorbitant. Her family never saw a cent and sadly struggle to pay their health insurance. Biological ownership is a tricky subject matter. The John Moore case was one of the cases that put it on the map and it has been a hot botton issue since. While there are some basic rules to follow, the gist is that once any tissue is ""abandoned"" at a hospital, it ceases to be property of the patient. Blood tests, biopsies and tissue taken from surgeries are property of the hospital and they have no obligation to let their patients know if and for what their tissues can be used. The scientific communty argues that to seek consent would lead to a decreased access to materials or have people seek financial gain. Personally, I find this troubling. The moral and ethical concerns are overwhelming and getting to an agreement between both parties is a battle. Scientific progress is important but at what cost? This is a book that will stay with me for a while. Its up there with 'The Radium Girls' (another great non-fiction work). Highly recommended!"
598,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher,2,"2.5 stars. I found the 1st 1/2 of this book fascinating and eagerly awaited to hear more of Henrietta's story. Henrietta was someone you couldn't help but root for and you were amazed to hear of her strength and perpetual optimism. The 2nd 1/2 of this book was tedious and annoying. The book started to drag and focus too much on the researcher's hardships, but mostly, I found Henrietta's family to be utterly unlikable. I kept thinking of that saying, ""I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you"". I felt much of the Lacks family, particularly Deborah and Joe (who changed his name to the long Z name), enjoyed being miserable. Despite being corrected again and again on their misbeliefs, they would resort right back to harboring on their anger/hatred/anxiousness over falsities. I felt their actions reflected a disregard for much of the advancements that came about from their mother's indirect contribution to medicine, but focused instead on a victim mentality and desire for monetary contribution - monetary contribution for something they had absolutely nothing to do with and had not worked for one iota.  As for the ethics surrounding Henrietta's cells being taken, be it right or wrong, she was not treated any differently than rich white patients were at that time when it came to taking cells/tissue without informed consent. In that sense, I don't think she was personally wronged in an intentional manner, though I think it's crazy what could be done without informed consent at that time. If you want to talk about who was wronged in an intentional manner, we'll talk about Elsie. Furthermore, I'm not completely convinced that some things were not explained to Henrietta regarding sampling cells. It was stated by Henrietta and the Lacks family time and again that they often came away with a poor understanding after speaking with MDs, yet they did not ask further questions or state their lack of understanding. Therefore, anytime it was exclaimed they were told ""nothing"", I had doubts. Henrietta's cells as they were taken, were of very little worth. It was the ingenuity of the people that used them that gave them their worth. Should Henrietta have received a modest compensation? Perhaps, it's muddled for me. Organ donors do not receive compensation (or their families). The reward is knowing you have saved other's lives. Should her children be entitled to compensation decades later for advancements that continue to be made 50 years after the cells were taken - cells that were not even from their own body? Definitely not. Is her family entitled to give permission for what can and cannot be done to Henrietta's cells? Absolutely not. Informed consent (which was not legally required at that time) is between the patient and the MD - what other family members wish is insignificant. The most interesting part of this story for me was easily Henrietta's story. Her childhood, the abuse of the time to the poor and minorities, the overt racist culture, and her strong optimistic nature that she maintained despite the world burning around her. The part that made the story a chore to finish was the ignorance that the family clung to despite being informed of truths, and the smallness with which they appreciated the lives that have been saved due to the awful cancer their mother acquired compared to the greatness with which they felt they deserved money as a result of research and ingenuity that they had never participated in, let alone understood.

601,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268245-greta,4,20th century medicine is another area of institutional racism that the story of Henrietta Lacks illustrates in very fine detail.

I’m pretty ignorant to the inner workings of the medical research world but the ethics of using cells seems pretty clear. I’m thrilled HeLa cells have lead to epic medical breakthroughs and continue to help find cures for cancer, etc. but what the Lacks family has gone through when their mother’s cells are involved is heartbreaking. Currently, HeLa cells are being used to try and find a cure and vaccine for Covid-19. The widespread medical advances that were/are possible thanks to Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells are staggering and a blessing. So reading about her family, too poor to afford health care and medicine their mother’s cells likely helped develop is just shitty. Still, I’m so happy I read this book and educated myself. TW: (severe) child abuse, graphic medical situations, cancer, molestation, pedophilia, incest, mistreatment if mentally handicapped in hospital settings in 50s, mistreatment, abuse, and murder of black people at the hands of the medical field, murder, drug use, cheating, domestic abuse... this isn’t an easy read, friends.

603,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol,5,"Skloot, Rebecca - The Immortal Life of Henrietta LacksThis has been on my TBR list for most of the year. I knew I wanted to read it as soon as I heard it involved The HeLa Cells. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew I had heard about these famous cells taken from an African American woman diagnosed with cervical cancer in the 50’s. The cells were taken without her knowledge and without the knowledge of her family. The cells lived, she did not. Meet Henrietta Lacks.Like the author, Rebecca Skloot, I was curious to know more about Henrietta, to learn more about the details of the cell experimentations, what they have done for science and why they are important to our lives. Skloot is a science journalist and has the credentials to dig into the story and inform. I give her a great deal of credit for the ten years she took to research the book and for having the perseverance to continue to contact Henrietta’s relatives who were reluctant to talk to a reporter. Building trust with the family was not an easy task, but eventually Skloot was able to ensure them that her intentions were good. Though the story could have been told from interviews with doctors and possibly from records at Johns Hopkins, what really brings Henrietta alive in my mind is the personal stories of her kin, particularly her daughter, Deborah. I liked the format Skloot used to write the book. You can hear what she says about this in the FAQ portion of her website.Critics of the book complain that Skloot has made this a story of race. Personally, I don’t see how you can begin to know Henrietta and her family without talking about race. But, yes, it is more than that. It’s about informed consent, pharmaceutical companies making mega dollars, treatment of patients, and ethics. It is also the story of the quest of a daughter to better know her mother, who died when she was young. It is a story of this daughter’s love for the woman she comes to know. I am pleased that Rebecca Skloot has set up Henrietta Lacks Foundation, which this year granted five of the Lacks descendents for their education. There is much to think about after reading this book. I still have questions. Some of the science goes over my head, but Skloot did a good job keeping this in layman’s terms. Today, due to privacy laws we would not know the name of the woman that the cells were harvested from. I’m in agreement with this but am still glad that in this case, Henrietta Lacks was identified and that through the efforts of Rebecca Skloot that I have a better picture of who Henrietta was. She never knew her contribution to medicine, but it seems to be significant. "
604,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/287912-melissa,2,"I'm having a hard time accepting the fundamental premise of this book; that because Henrietta Lacks's cancer cells continue to grow and have since the 50s, she herself is somehow still alive. Because she's not. And these are cancer cells anyway - of her body, but not of her personally. If you scraped a cancer cell out of me, it wouldn't take care of my kid or go to work for me, so why would you say that I was still alive? I think a lot of Deborah Lacks's heartache might've been averted if this myth of Henrietta's aliveness hadn't been perpetuated. Without being told that her mother was still ""alive"", she'd have no need to stress out to the point of almost stroking out about her mother still being able to feel the pain of an atomic bomb blast, the pain of cancer treatment drugs, AIDS drugs, etc. I'm in no way denying the achievement of HeLa cells or what they've done to further scientific achievement, I just can't buy that their existence means that Henrietta Lacks is still alive.

605,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10942210-john,4,Wow. I was enthralled during the first half of the book but it started to drag at the end. Definetly lost its magic of storytelling at the end and almost sounded just like retyped journal notes. BUT this tells an important story that should be required for all medical scientists. It humanizes their work and ties this to real people. 
606,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31167656-bookworm,4,A well researched and exquisitely told story. I listened to the audio which was highly entertaining. Absolutely fascinating! It's hard to believe this happened in the 1950's!!
607,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2299298-pages-for-breakfast-x1f4da-formerly-readage,5,"From my blog: https://bookgirl1987thoughts.wordpres...I'm sure many of you have already read this book, as it was published in early 2010 and made headlines as a bestselling piece of medical/science nonfiction. Rebecca Skloot is an award-winning science writer who became interested in the story of Henrietta Lacks (known as HeLa in the medical/scientific community) when she took a biology course at sixteen that changed her outlook on the world of science forever. Her instructor wrote the name HENRIETTA LACKS as he was discussing cell culture and Skloot was anxious to investigate. Her HeLa fascination started there, and continued throughout her graduate school studies in writing, as she contemplated researching and writing about Henrietta Lacks. Eventually, she put pen to paper and brought HeLa's story to light.The book is a wonderfully written, and in my opinion, smartly-paced piece of nonfiction. It does a masterful job of detailing Skloot's heavy involvement in the HeLa chaos that resulted from an unethical medical treatment on a poverty-stricken black woman from Virginia in 1951. If you decide to read this book, (and I really hope you do), in the first half of the narrative you will meet a lovely, sweet woman named Henrietta Lacks and discover that she is suffering from a particularly aggressive form of cervical cancer. Diagnosed at the tender age of 30, Henrietta's cancer spreads rapidly and cuts short her life in a tragic flash, leaving behind a husband, five children, and surrounding family members who eventually live in the upsetting wake of Henrietta's undisclosed, yet amazing contribution to science.(I dislike book reviews that give blow-by-blow, page-by-page details of the book; I want you to read the book, not just this review, so I refrain here from delving too deeply into the scientific material you will find in the book.) I do want to reassure any ambivalent readers that this is an incredibly entertaining science book, without being overly scientific or stuffy in any way! It is very accessible to readers of all scientific knowledge, and will most definitely appeal to people who know absolutely nothing about cellular biology and cell cultures. (It explains things along the way). I started this book hoping the information would not go right over my head, and I'm pleased to say that none of the concepts escaped me intellectually. From a scientific perspective, Skloot has written an informative history of the HeLa cells, and that alone makes this book rewarding.However, I must say that the human element of the book is the author's number one achievement. Meeting the Lacks family members, one by one, and learning of their daily lives and coping mechanisms was even more interesting to me than the amazing science behind the HeLa phenomenon. Once you absorb and process the initial shock in the first half of the book of how radical HeLa cells truly are, you begin to settle into a second half of the narrative that just grabs your heart and doesn't let go until the last page. Skloot skips back and forth in time, and it was an interesting way to tell the story. We have a few chapters detailing events in 1951 when Henrietta was alive and in the thick of her illness, and then we flash forward to 1999 and onward to events in the author's life as she makes connections with the Lacks family and begins her very hands-on research. (Personally, I didn't find the structure detracting in any way; I felt that it kept the HeLa history very rooted and upfront in the successive decades and chapters, therefore not allowing the reader to lose sight of the very real woman and family behind the science and medical discoveries.)Speaking further of the sincerely human element of the book, Deborah Lacks was my absolute favorite part of the book! (I won't go so far as to say that she overshadowed her mother in the narrative, but I admit that she really did manage to catapult me that much further into the story). The initial portrait of Henrietta Lacks begins the story, and when her daughter Deborah steps in later in the book, you really get the sense that Deborah is trying her damndest to resolve the chaos and confusion that factor so strongly in the book. Henrietta is no longer around to speak for herself, but her cells do much of the ""talking"" in this book, and Deborah's voice rings just as true and sincere as her mother's biological determinism.I'm going to wrap up here, because the longer I spend on this review, the longer you might spend reading about it instead of picking up the book! I strongly recommend that you find a copy of the audiobook of ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" by Rebecca Skloot narrated by Cassandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin. I read along and listened to this awesome recording and am so glad I did. I feel like the characters really came alive with this audiobook narration. The voices are very expressive, and I think you will enjoy it!"
608,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3106785-beth-bonini,5,"I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to reading this book. I've had it on my shelf for years, and my daughter - who loves nonfiction - had read it and raved about it. But I'm a big believer in that some books just bide their time, waiting for the right moment, and perhaps this was true of this book. Just before reading this book, I saw the documentary Thirteenth, and I couldn't help but think of how Henrietta Lacks' family history is the living embodiment of the painful, tragic history of African Americans in the United States. Thirteenth traces the history of African Americans: from the 'official' end of slavery in January 31, 1865, when the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution abolished slavery except as a punishment for a crime, to the present day. It's an incredibly thought-provoking documentary and it makes the persuasive case that African Americans (or people of color, as they are usually referred to in the documentary) have never truly transcended their second-class citizen status. Every time one societal change is made, racism mutates (rather like a cancerous cell) to become a different and yet still malignant disease.Henrietta was born in Roanoke, Virginia on August 18, 1920. She was only four years old when her mother died giving birth to her 10th child. Henrietta was then raised by her grandfather, along with a slightly older first cousin called 'Day'. They lived on a tobacco farm, and from an early age the children helped pick and cure the tobacco leaves. When Henrietta was 14, she became pregnant for the first time; Day was the father. By age 31, Henrietta was dead. She had given birth to 5 children, and died of cervical cancer after a swift and painful illness. (Henrietta had the most virulent form of the HPV virus, and a vaccine for this virus was made possible by the research done with her malignant cells.) I suppose there were countless women like Henrietta - women who had short and painful lives - but Henrietta's life has its own strange and unique immortality because she happened to be treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and her cancerous cells (now known as HeLa) have become the most famous and useful cells in human history.This book combines two different strands - one of them the medical advancements made possible by HeLa, and the other being the parallel existence of Henrietta's descendents. The fact that Henrietta Lacks was poor and black has nothing to do with her cells, but there is the vexed issue of medical experimentation being carried out on the vulnerable - and author Rebecca Skloot does a good job of contextualising this for the reader. Henrietta didn't knowingly contribute her body to the advancement of science, but the truth is that most of the amazing accomplishments and discoveries of the 20th century can be traced back to her cells. (There are many examples of this in the book, and you don't need an extensive knowledge of biology to understand Skloot's explanations.) Sadly, Henrietta's descendents have in no way benefited from the cash cow of HeLa and their collective story was absorbing and rather heartbreaking. The heart of the story is Deborah - a daughter who never knew her mother - and whose long, painful quest to learn the truth of the HeLa cells is really a personal journey of finding her lost mother.This was a fascinating study of social history and I found it to be a completely absorbing read. I don't tend to think of nonfiction as 'unputdownable', but that is how I would describe this book."
609,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,5,"Compelling and fascinating pageturner that weaves the unique and groundbreaking story behind the HeLa cells that have revolutionized medical science in the last century. Skloot puts a name, a face, and a rich family history around the cells of Henrietta Lacks, who the ""immortal"" cells were essentially stolen from in the 1950s after she started treatment for severe cervical cancer. Medical records, archival research, and oral history paint a vivid picture of the Lacks' family's struggles in 1950s Baltimore. Skloot tells the story first hand, as she meets the surviving members of the Lacks family, and becomes very close to Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah. The book details very painful events (specifically Henrietta's abysmal ""care"" in the hospital after her tumors were discovered, and the treatment of Henrietta's other daughter, Elsie, in the Home for the Negro Insane) in the Lacks' family history. Skloot travels to southern Virginia where Henrietta grew up, and where she is now buried. The personal side of the book is so captivating, and the way Skloot interweaves this story in with the scientific information is near seamless. It's very well-done and quite accessible for a non-scientific audience. I learned a lot about genetics and about the research that the famous HeLa cells have engendered. I particularly enjoyed the portion of the book when the researcher spent the day with Skloot and Deborah Lacks, explaining the true breakthroughs from the HeLa cell line. There is soome criticism (here on GoodReads as well) that the book spent too much time with the Lacks' descendants, but I would argue that this is a very important part of the book - noting that while the Jim Crow laws are not in place, and the legal system is more aware of scientific research and patient ""rights"", there have not been socioeconomic strides for science education and alleviation of poverty in these inner-city areas. Skloot provided a very important context to the story of HeLa by setting the scene with Deborah, Zecharia, Lawrence, and the ""cousins"" in rural Virginia. On a local note, it was very interesting to learn the details about the Lacks family and their history in the Baltimore region. I have lived near Baltimore (and even worked and took classes at the institution that plays a large - and unfortunate - role in this book) for years and did not know some of the things that were discussed. Even closer to home, I was moved, and saddened to learn about the tragedies that happened at the Crownsville hospital, which is near my parents' home, and where I went to high school. I didn't realize the full history of the institution. Very moving story, and it is highly recommended. "
610,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h,4,"Henrietta Lacks was a poor Southern woman and mother of five children who died in 1951 as the result of a remarkably aggressive form of cervical cancer. While undergoing radiation treatment, doctors at Johns Hopkins took samples of her cells without her consent, to better study the cancer. These cells, known as HeLa, became an important scientific and medical tool—they were the first ""immortal"" human cells grown in culture, and they are still alive today. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. But very little was known about the woman from whom these cells came, and her family was unaware of Henrietta's contributions to science for many, many years. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells Henrietta's story and chronicles the struggles of her family, most of whom never had the opportunity to even finish high school, to understand what cells were taken from her and what scientists were doing with them. Rebecca Skloot also gives a great deal of background into scientific research, particularly where cell and tissue study is concerned, and the challenges both the scientific and medical ethics communities face relative to ""donations"" of cells taken from patients. But in the end, this is the story of Henrietta's family and the emotions that the discovery of her role in science uncovers. While the subject of this book is very scientific, much of it reads like a novel. It is a fantastic story—sometimes shocking, sometimes heartbreaking—but Skloot gives depth not only to Henrietta and her family, but the researchers who both studied and questioned the HeLa cells through the years. When this book was released last year to tremendous acclaim, I didn't think it would interest me much, but a friend recently recommended it, and I'm glad I was motivated to pick it up. Don't be put off by the subject matter; in the end, this will pique your curiosity and tug at your heart. And you'll definitely look with a different eye at the next medical procedure you have! "
611,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,4,"An important story, well-told by Rebecca Skloot, this book is about Henrietta Lacks and her cancerous cells that are known as the HeLa line. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was a poor, uneducated black woman living with her husband and five young children in Baltimore when she developed cervical cancer and soon died. Without her knowledge or consent, cells from her cancer were cultured, distributed, and used in thousands of experiments continuing to this day, including pivotal developments in research about polio, radiation exposure, cancer, and more. The book successfully juxtaposes scientific information about the cells with the story of Henrietta's family and their fractured relationship with the medical establishment. The family was hounded by researchers who wanted DNA samples, without ever explaining what it was all about or offering any medical treatment to Henrietta's children who cope with multiple chronic diseases and no health insurance. Angry at what she sees as arrogant white doctors' appropriation of her mother, Henrietta's daughter Deborah asks, ""If our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can't afford to see no doctors?"" The experiences of another family member, a developmentally disabled daughter called Elsie, reveal even more disturbing truths about the medical treatment of African Americans in the recent past.While the science and history aspects of this book are worthwhile, what makes the book really engaging is the human story about Deborah coming to terms with these terrible discoveries. When I read The Help, I was disturbed by what I saw as that white author's attempt to insert herself into a heroic role in the story, rescuing the black characters and earning their gratitude. This book could easily fall into the same trap, but Skloot lets Deborah take center stage and shows when Deborah is angry or mistrustful of her. Skloot may lead Deborah to some of the facts about Henrietta and Elsie, but the accomplishment of processing them is all Deborah's."
612,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47767530-margo,5,"Reads as easily as a novel, but is non-fiction. Makes science accessible and interesting and tells the story of the Lacks family easily and honestly. A sometimes painful story, punctured with humor and emotion balanced by impeccable research into medical history. If you have not read it, I would highly recommend it.Sometimes I could not put it down and other times I had to put it down to digest either the raw emotions sometimes described or to absorb my reactions to the medical progress and medical ethics presented. Sometime the facts made me mad, other times it just amazed me how far we have progressed. I think I understood even more of the suspicion of poor, black families have of white, educated scientists and reporters. It made me angry but gave me a deeper understanding of the great gulf that has been created by procedures that took place at the time of Ms. Lacks cancer treatments on then use of her cells. "

617,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,5,"This book is amazing, being pretty well written and very interesting, and in addition, raising so many questions and issues related to research and our rights for our cells and tissues. Henrietta Lacks and her family's story is fascinating, and the topic as a whole still have many open questions.It would be an understatement to say that Henrietta Lacks is one of the most important people in science. The cells that were taken from her cervical cancer, are called HeLa and were used to develop the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects and so much more. Henrietta did not get a thank you, neither her family get recognition (or a medical insurance), she did not even get a marked grave. No permission was asked to use these cells, and not for commercializing them. People do not own the waste of their tissues, especially not poor colored people, right? Henrietta's cancer killed her very young, and left her children motherless. But science wouldn't be the same without her, and she lived through her cells helping to make giant progress.As Charles Dickens said at the beginning of [A] Tale of Two Cities, ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.’ But it was the best of times for science in that this very peculiar tumor gave rise to the HeLa cell line. … For Mrs. Lacks and the family she left behind, it was the worst of times. Scientific progress and indeed progress of all kinds is often made at great cost, such as the sacrifice made by Henrietta Lacks.Many scientists worked daily with HeLa cells, and didn't know or asked themselves where did these come from, and what is the story behind these important cells.He’d been working with HeLa cells daily his whole career, he said, and now he couldn’t get the story of Henrietta and her family out of his mind. Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, that lost her mother very young was furious. She did not know what exactly happened to her mother, or what is being done with her cells. She was rightly mad that her story, or even the recognition should be widely known. She was afraid, and being not very educated and going through very hard life, was paranoid from anybody that tried to talk to her about her mother, her medical files, or anything else related to it.“You know they shot my mother cells into space and blew her up with nuclear bombs? They even did that thing … what do you call it … um … cloning! … that’s right, they did that cloning on her.”... “You wouldn’t believe it,” she said. “You know they mixed her with mice to make a human-mouse? They say she’s not even human anymore!” She laughed a loud, manic laugh and ran to the window. “Holy cuss!”  But Deborah's fears weren't completely irrational. In the past black people were considered dispensable, their bodies were used for research, as they were slaves. And the Ku Klux Klan actually started as a threatening technique to prevent them from escaping from their owners. (I recommend The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration by Isabel Wilkerson to see how much more black people had to be afraid of, such as lynching). Just imagine trying on them surgical techniques without using anesthesia.Some of the stories were conjured by white plantation owners taking advantage of the long-held African belief that ghosts caused disease and death. To discourage slaves from meeting or escaping, slave owners told tales of gruesome research done on black bodies, then covered themselves in white sheets and crept around at night, posing as spirits coming to infect black people with disease or steal them for research. Those sheets eventually gave rise to the white hooded cloaks of the Ku Klux Klan. But night doctors weren’t just fictions conjured as scare tactics. Many doctors tested drugs on slaves and operated on them to develop new surgical techniques, often without using anesthesia. Fear of night doctors only increased in the early 1900s, as black people migrated north to Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, and news spread that medical schools there were offering money in exchange for bodies. Black corpses were routinely exhumed from graves for research, and an under ground shipping industry kept schools in the North supplied with black bodies from the South for anatomy courses. The bodies sometimes arrived, a dozen or so at a time, in barrels labeled turpentine.Prisoners were also a population that was under the threat of inhumane experiments on human beings. In some cases, they even signed up for the research, without really understanding what it means. Some would say that these are pretty similar to what the Nazis did. Cancer cell injections to inmates is just one exmaple of taking advantage of uneducated captured people for the good of science. Unimaginable in our world today that tries to prevent research on animals. Southam gave multiple cancer cell injections to each prisoner, and unlike the terminally ill patients, those men fought off the cancer completely. And with each new injection, their bodies responded faster, which seemed to indicate that the cells were increasing the inmates’ immunity to cancer. When Southam reported his results, the press hailed them as a tremendous breakthrough that could someday lead to a cancer vaccine. In the coming years, Southam injected HeLa and other living cancer cells into more than six hundred people for his research, about half of them cancer patients. He also began injecting them into every gynecologic surgery patient who came to Sloan-Kettering’s Memorial Hospital or its James Ewing Hospital. If he explained anything, he simply said he was testing them for cancer. And he believed he was: Since people with cancer seemed to reject the cells more slowly than healthy people did, Southam thought that by timing the rejection rate, he might be able to find undiagnosed cases of cancer.Coming back to the human right on the human body. Legislation around our user data, our documents etc is very advanced today. But what about our right for our cells and genes? Some claims about asking permission exclaimed that it would be against the progress of science, that it is just a human waste and therefore people don't have the right for it anymore. But it is probably not their place to decide, and the world is marching to defend people rights wherever it comes up. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a good start to fix the problems that still exist in this field.And there is a bright side, and Henrietta is an example that one person can have a giant impact on the world. Without education, money, or too much luck, she succeeded to get science to great breakthroughs.he pointed around the room at Davon and JaBrea’s other cousins, saying, “So will that child … and that child … and that child. This is their story now. They need to take hold of it and let it teach them they can change the world too.”5 stars for a woman bigger than life, and an important historical evolvement in an ever changing world."
618,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1206965-rach,5,"If I could give this book 10 stars, I would. It is an amazing story of Henrietta Lacks, whose cervical cancer cells became the first ""immortal"" cells in the study of human cell cultures. It covers the story of her life, death, and how her cells have changed science as we know it. In 1951, it was common for tissue to be taken without a patient's knowledge, especially when the patient was black. This book touches on how that simple fact changed a family's life. Much of the book discusses how it effected Henrietta's children once they found out that their mother's tumor had been taken and experimented on without her consent during the biopsy of the tumor. Upon her death, consent was given for an autopsy and some samples to be taken, but it was because her husband wasn't fully informed and thought that the tests would detect whether his and Henrietta's children had cancer.The book also discusses race issues and class issues that have touched the Lacks family's life. It discusses what care was common for black people in the early 50s and how many black people didn't get basic health care because they simply couldn't afford it and because it was well-known that black patients were often experimented on. It's heartbreaking to read about her family's complete misunderstanding of what had been done to their mother. When Henrietta's children were told about the fact that Henrietta's cells were still alive and being studied, 25 years after her death, they first thought that their mother had been kept alive all that time and was being experimented on. This wasn't because they were intellectually unable to understand it (as shown by how Deborah, Henrietta's surviving daughter, taught herself a lot of the science surrounding the testing done on the cell line established from Henrietta's cell sample), but because they were so poor that they weren't given basic science education and because of the lingering taint on the medical establishment that remained due to the Tuskegee airmen experiment and similar experiments. It's also heartbreaking to read about the fact that the Lacks' family had, at the time of the publishing of the book, no health insurance, even though their mother's cells have been sold and resold uncountable times.The race issues are also discussed when it comes to the care of Elsie, who was institutionalized when Henrietta became ill, because she was significantly developmentally disabled. Unfortunately, Elsie's life wasn't as well-documented as Henrietta's life, and many of her medical files were lost between the time of her death and when Skloot and Deborah begin their research into Elsie's life. But it's made clear that experiments were done on Elsie without the family's consent and that it was quite common at the time for experiments to be done on those in mental institutions.Lastly, this book touches on how the issue of the ownership of tissues taken for samples and payment for any treatments or cures to the owner of the tissues is evolving. As of right now, once you sign away the rights to your tissue, you sign away the monetary rights, but the law is still trying to find the ""right"" answer to this issue.I cannot recommend this book enough. Even if you're not interested in the scientific aspect of it, it's a book that should be read for the human side of the story, along with the medical ethics issues. I'll end with saying that there are some triggery things in this book, especially if you have issues surrounding medical things being done to you without your consent. But I think that should go without saying. Everything is handled as sensitively as possible, though. I found that the matter-of-fact matter in which Skloot writes makes it all a bit harder to digest, especially if you're very unused to these things being discussed so openly. But I think that style suits this story -- the things that happened to this family should make you uncomfortable. "
619,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin,4,"This book was excellent and I found myself totally drawn into Henrietta's story right from the first few pages. Rebecca Skloot is a journalist with a keen interest in discovering the truth behind the HeLa cells, the infamous cells that multiplied faster than any others in culture and made dozens of new scientific break-throughs possible. These cells were taken from Henrietta Lacks, a black woman diagnosed with cervical cancer, when she was being treated, without her knowledge, and long after her death they continue to be used world-wide. What I loved about this story was the raw personable tone to the writing. This book fully deserved to win the Wellcomebookprize in my eyes, becuase it was truly a wonder of storytelling, fact and fiction all wonderfully blended. Skloot manages to tell us the important details of science in a way that feels approachable and easy, whilst also showing the raw side of the deal that the Lacks family ended up with, and the emotional connection she herself had with the daughter of the family. This is truly a story that more people need to learn about and experience. A beautiful book, an informative piece of writing, and a very deserved winner of the prize in my eyes. Excellent, 4.5*s "

622,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3258351-emily,2,"This book has already been lauded and reviewed to the moon and to the garbage can, which is where I think it should go. The story, as Skloot tells it, has already been told in articles and, briefly, in another book, but Skloot feels called to tell it again. Unfortunately, this is the very public story of a private individual and her family who have never consented to any of this and are tired of white people turning up on their doorstep looking for inside information. Skloot acknowledges this without stopping and finding a new hobby.Here's a far from complete list of problems with this book:So little science. It's written for your aunt's book club, but with Skloot's litany of, ""HeLa cells have been sent into space, blown up in an atom bomb, fought AIDS, etc,"" I would like to know how HeLa cells helped create bombs, for example. There's a little bit about cell reproduction and a little about the creation of the polio vaccine, but anything is exciting is when its blasted into space. Please explain how this was done. Use simple words. Use metaphors. But don't just say, ""Science happened.""My other problems are tied racism, mostly Skloot's. She drives through a Black Baltimore neighborhood for over an hour looking for a store without stopping because [stopping to ask black people for directions is scary]. She keeps waving at the same men. Children are running after her car. And she seeks a church for sanctuary.Formal address. Henrietta Lacks' children call Skloot ""Miss Rebecca."" (http://ask.metafilter.com/224268/Sout...) Skloot calls Henrietta Lacks and her relatives by their first names. Doctors and scientists are called by their last names.Mrs. Lacks' daughter Deborah makes an expository statement on doctors kidnapping and doing medical experiments on Blacks. Skloot explains at length why the medical establishment was not actually kidnapping Black people for the purpose of medical experimentation. Skloot does mention Tuskegee and some other documented incidents of non-consensual, fatal medical experiments; and later she and Deborah go to the Hospital for the Negro Insane, where Deborah's sister had horrific medical experiments performed on her. The kidnapping of Black people (Fugitive Slave Act, lynching, etc.) should be well known. But Skloot needs to refute, at length, Deborah's conflation of kidnapping and medical experiments. Aaargh! It is not up to the oppressed to determine which people are kidnapping them and which people are doing horrific medical experiments and then make the distinction between the two groups in casual conversation.And Skloot's treatment of Deborah in general. Skloot seems genuinely impressed by Deborah's research on HeLa cells, but she never goes so far as to help her, or connect her with a lawyer to look into the legitimacy of a suit against, say, Johns Hopkins for releasing Mrs. Lacks' medical records without consent. Skloot refuses to give a percentage of book sales to Mrs. Lacks' descendants directly, instead creating a scholarship fund of which she is the gatekeeper. And the last day Skloot and Deborah travel together, Skloot's describes Deborah's crazy, manic behavior as though it was a consistent with Deborah's normal self, even though Skloot learns the next day that Deborah was having a major medical episode that caused her to act erratically. The writing is bad. The progression of HeLa research through the Cold War era is appropriately chronological. But when Skloot comes on the scene, she describes everything in the order it happened to her, instead of pulling it together coherently and making it less of a travelogue into the lives of the Black people she was badgering.Also, Bahni Turpin does all the Black voices on the audiobook and another person reads the rest of the text. That might be an allegorical manifestation of the book itself. The white person speaks at length and freely, while the Black characters are handed a representation bone."
623,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2344676-neil,2,"I remember the first time I heard of Henrietta and her family's story; like Skloot, it was as a brief aside during a biology class and, like Skloot, it affected me much more than the teacher seemed to think it should. When I heard about Skloot's book, I was very interested.Unfortunately, Skloot's book's a bit of a mess, and the material itself makes the reasons why pretty clear. The idea has been gestating for at least 10 years, and she's probably been writing for at least five; she clearly had dozens of directions she wanted to go with the book - mainly, though, detailing the story of a wronged southern black family and talking about the injustices of the old South and telling the story of a cell line which have had a profound impact on science. Unfortunately, these two don't tie together in any significant way, and Skloot, probably because she spent so much time with the family and envisioned this book as a science-based human interest story, emphasizes, to the book's detriment, the human interest part (it may well be because - and I don't know because I don't know much about it - people familiar with science know of many accounts of the actual history of HeLa cells). To the point where we are finding out details of the lives of many of Henrietta's cousins and children and grandchildren, which just make the narrative a complete mess.Henrietta's story, too, is not particularly ethically complicated; she received what was proper treatment, and, though the biopsy was performed without her approval, it hardly added any pain to her situation, there was no malicious intent from the doctors, and indeed Skloot talks at one point about how little interest Gey, the scientist who originally worked with her cells, had in profit and instead how much he cared about the advancement of science at the expense of his own potential for patents, etc.Her narrative of the history of cell culture is interesting, but the science is massively toned down. She also tries to include silly stuff about religion v. science - she mentions some thoughts a little bit at the book's very beginning, but it disappears until the very end, at which point she has not at all established it as any sort of important consideration in this story.And, I really don't mean to go into ad hominem attacks here - Skloot seems well-intentioned and liberal-minded - but I feel that Skloot inserted herself into the story far too much. Like, with the whole storyline culminating in Deborah finally letting her look at the medical records, she seemed to paint herself as some sort of redeemer of all the prior sins against the Lacks family which she spent so long detailing. One particularly bizarre scene is when Deborah and her grandchildren ride to see Zakariyya (p. 242 in my version), and the grandchildren, whom Skloot described as ""strkingly beautiful"" say to Skloot both ""I love you"" and ""You're mine."" These eight lines could be stricken from the book without losing, you know, anything at all, but Skloot, a writing teacher, should know that every detail should be in a narrative for a reason. What is the reason here? It's strange. Why does she insist we see how much she is loved by the children, especially in this flirtatious way?"

While the content will most likely leave readers feeling a whole range of emotions from sadness to anger, the actual content of this book is something that needs to be read by all people regardless of color, age, or background. While there are parts of the story that seem exploitative (I honestly felt as if Skloot sometimes went into too much detail about different parts of the Lacks' family's dysfunction when describing individuals who are currently living), the overall story of Henrietta Lacks' body being defiled and her cells taken without her or her family's consent all in the name of science is something that everyone should read up on."

There's been a lot of profit derived from them that has never reached them.2. THIS is how you tell a story. It's not contrived. It's complex. She doesn't tell us what to think (that much), but lays out the story in such a way that your own thoughts and emotions fill that last crucial gap. 3. I'm so grateful for HELA. Man, thank God for science!4. I was a bit uncomfortable with the way Skloot characterized the family. There was warmth and tenderness, but also a bit of exotification or ""otherness"" to the way she covered them. 5. Having watched Get Out, I thought about this story differently "

I loved how Rebecca Skloot combined the scientific and familial aspects of this book to make a work of non-fiction seem like it was a fiction novel. Also, she included her own personal aspects, showing her struggle through the research process and learning about Henrietta's family. I personally think that science and medicine is fascinating (as I want to study either pediatrics or dermatology), so I am very glad that I was required to read this book for school as it exposed me to HeLa cells and both the impact that they made on the scientific community and on Henrietta Lack's family.

I’m pretty ignorant to the inner workings of the medical research world but the ethics of using cells seems pretty clear. I’m thrilled HeLa cells have lead to epic medical breakthroughs and continue to help find cures for cancer, etc. but what the Lacks family has gone through when their mother’s cells are involved is heartbreaking. Currently, HeLa cells are being used to try and find a cure and vaccine for Covid-19. The widespread medical advances that were/are possible thanks to Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells are staggering and a blessing. So reading about her family, too poor to afford health care and medicine their mother’s cells likely helped develop is just shitty. Still, I’m so happy I read this book and educated myself. TW: (severe) child abuse, graphic medical situations, cancer, molestation, pedophilia, incest, mistreatment if mentally handicapped in hospital settings in 50s, mistreatment, abuse, and murder of black people at the hands of the medical field, murder, drug use, cheating, domestic abuse... this isn’t an easy read, friends. "
633,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol,5,"Skloot, Rebecca - The Immortal Life of Henrietta LacksThis has been on my TBR list for most of the year. I knew I wanted to read it as soon as I heard it involved The HeLa Cells. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew I had heard about these famous cells taken from an African American woman diagnosed with cervical cancer in the 50’s. The cells were taken without her knowledge and without the knowledge of her family. The cells lived, she did not. Meet Henrietta Lacks.Like the author, Rebecca Skloot, I was curious to know more about Henrietta, to learn more about the details of the cell experimentations, what they have done for science and why they are important to our lives. Skloot is a science journalist and has the credentials to dig into the story and inform. I give her a great deal of credit for the ten years she took to research the book and for having the perseverance to continue to contact Henrietta’s relatives who were reluctant to talk to a reporter. Building trust with the family was not an easy task, but eventually Skloot was able to ensure them that her intentions were good. Though the story could have been told from interviews with doctors and possibly from records at Johns Hopkins, what really brings Henrietta alive in my mind is the personal stories of her kin, particularly her daughter, Deborah. I liked the format Skloot used to write the book. You can hear what she says about this in the FAQ portion of her website.Critics of the book complain that Skloot has made this a story of race. Personally, I don’t see how you can begin to know Henrietta and her family without talking about race. But, yes, it is more than that. It’s about informed consent, pharmaceutical companies making mega dollars, treatment of patients, and ethics. It is also the story of the quest of a daughter to better know her mother, who died when she was young. It is a story of this daughter’s love for the woman she comes to know. I am pleased that Rebecca Skloot has set up Henrietta Lacks Foundation, which this year granted five of the Lacks descendents for their education. There is much to think about after reading this book. I still have questions. Some of the science goes over my head, but Skloot did a good job keeping this in layman’s terms. Today, due to privacy laws we would not know the name of the woman that the cells were harvested from. I’m in agreement with this but am still glad that in this case, Henrietta Lacks was identified and that through the efforts of Rebecca Skloot that I have a better picture of who Henrietta was. She never knew her contribution to medicine, but it seems to be significant. "
634,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/287912-melissa,2,"I'm having a hard time accepting the fundamental premise of this book; that because Henrietta Lacks's cancer cells continue to grow and have since the 50s, she herself is somehow still alive. Because she's not. And these are cancer cells anyway - of her body, but not of her personally. If you scraped a cancer cell out of me, it wouldn't take care of my kid or go to work for me, so why would you say that I was still alive? I think a lot of Deborah Lacks's heartache might've been averted if this myth of Henrietta's aliveness hadn't been perpetuated. Without being told that her mother was still ""alive"", she'd have no need to stress out to the point of almost stroking out about her mother still being able to feel the pain of an atomic bomb blast, the pain of cancer treatment drugs, AIDS drugs, etc. I'm in no way denying the achievement of HeLa cells or what they've done to further scientific achievement, I just can't buy that their existence means that Henrietta Lacks is still alive.

635,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10942210-john,4,Wow. I was enthralled during the first half of the book but it started to drag at the end. Definetly lost its magic of storytelling at the end and almost sounded just like retyped journal notes. BUT this tells an important story that should be required for all medical scientists. It humanizes their work and ties this to real people. 
636,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31167656-bookworm,4,A well researched and exquisitely told story. I listened to the audio which was highly entertaining. Absolutely fascinating! It's hard to believe this happened in the 1950's!!
637,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2299298-pages-for-breakfast-x1f4da-formerly-readage,5,"From my blog: https://bookgirl1987thoughts.wordpres...I'm sure many of you have already read this book, as it was published in early 2010 and made headlines as a bestselling piece of medical/science nonfiction. Rebecca Skloot is an award-winning science writer who became interested in the story of Henrietta Lacks (known as HeLa in the medical/scientific community) when she took a biology course at sixteen that changed her outlook on the world of science forever. Her instructor wrote the name HENRIETTA LACKS as he was discussing cell culture and Skloot was anxious to investigate. Her HeLa fascination started there, and continued throughout her graduate school studies in writing, as she contemplated researching and writing about Henrietta Lacks. Eventually, she put pen to paper and brought HeLa's story to light.The book is a wonderfully written, and in my opinion, smartly-paced piece of nonfiction. It does a masterful job of detailing Skloot's heavy involvement in the HeLa chaos that resulted from an unethical medical treatment on a poverty-stricken black woman from Virginia in 1951. If you decide to read this book, (and I really hope you do), in the first half of the narrative you will meet a lovely, sweet woman named Henrietta Lacks and discover that she is suffering from a particularly aggressive form of cervical cancer. Diagnosed at the tender age of 30, Henrietta's cancer spreads rapidly and cuts short her life in a tragic flash, leaving behind a husband, five children, and surrounding family members who eventually live in the upsetting wake of Henrietta's undisclosed, yet amazing contribution to science.(I dislike book reviews that give blow-by-blow, page-by-page details of the book; I want you to read the book, not just this review, so I refrain here from delving too deeply into the scientific material you will find in the book.) I do want to reassure any ambivalent readers that this is an incredibly entertaining science book, without being overly scientific or stuffy in any way! It is very accessible to readers of all scientific knowledge, and will most definitely appeal to people who know absolutely nothing about cellular biology and cell cultures. (It explains things along the way). I started this book hoping the information would not go right over my head, and I'm pleased to say that none of the concepts escaped me intellectually. From a scientific perspective, Skloot has written an informative history of the HeLa cells, and that alone makes this book rewarding.However, I must say that the human element of the book is the author's number one achievement. Meeting the Lacks family members, one by one, and learning of their daily lives and coping mechanisms was even more interesting to me than the amazing science behind the HeLa phenomenon. Once you absorb and process the initial shock in the first half of the book of how radical HeLa cells truly are, you begin to settle into a second half of the narrative that just grabs your heart and doesn't let go until the last page. Skloot skips back and forth in time, and it was an interesting way to tell the story. We have a few chapters detailing events in 1951 when Henrietta was alive and in the thick of her illness, and then we flash forward to 1999 and onward to events in the author's life as she makes connections with the Lacks family and begins her very hands-on research. (Personally, I didn't find the structure detracting in any way; I felt that it kept the HeLa history very rooted and upfront in the successive decades and chapters, therefore not allowing the reader to lose sight of the very real woman and family behind the science and medical discoveries.)Speaking further of the sincerely human element of the book, Deborah Lacks was my absolute favorite part of the book! (I won't go so far as to say that she overshadowed her mother in the narrative, but I admit that she really did manage to catapult me that much further into the story). The initial portrait of Henrietta Lacks begins the story, and when her daughter Deborah steps in later in the book, you really get the sense that Deborah is trying her damndest to resolve the chaos and confusion that factor so strongly in the book. Henrietta is no longer around to speak for herself, but her cells do much of the ""talking"" in this book, and Deborah's voice rings just as true and sincere as her mother's biological determinism.I'm going to wrap up here, because the longer I spend on this review, the longer you might spend reading about it instead of picking up the book! I strongly recommend that you find a copy of the audiobook of ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" by Rebecca Skloot narrated by Cassandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin. I read along and listened to this awesome recording and am so glad I did. I feel like the characters really came alive with this audiobook narration. The voices are very expressive, and I think you will enjoy it!"
638,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3106785-beth-bonini,5,"I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to reading this book. I've had it on my shelf for years, and my daughter - who loves nonfiction - had read it and raved about it. But I'm a big believer in that some books just bide their time, waiting for the right moment, and perhaps this was true of this book. Just before reading this book, I saw the documentary Thirteenth, and I couldn't help but think of how Henrietta Lacks' family history is the living embodiment of the painful, tragic history of African Americans in the United States. Thirteenth traces the history of African Americans: from the 'official' end of slavery in January 31, 1865, when the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution abolished slavery except as a punishment for a crime, to the present day. It's an incredibly thought-provoking documentary and it makes the persuasive case that African Americans (or people of color, as they are usually referred to in the documentary) have never truly transcended their second-class citizen status. Every time one societal change is made, racism mutates (rather like a cancerous cell) to become a different and yet still malignant disease.Henrietta was born in Roanoke, Virginia on August 18, 1920. She was only four years old when her mother died giving birth to her 10th child. Henrietta was then raised by her grandfather, along with a slightly older first cousin called 'Day'. They lived on a tobacco farm, and from an early age the children helped pick and cure the tobacco leaves. When Henrietta was 14, she became pregnant for the first time; Day was the father. By age 31, Henrietta was dead. She had given birth to 5 children, and died of cervical cancer after a swift and painful illness. (Henrietta had the most virulent form of the HPV virus, and a vaccine for this virus was made possible by the research done with her malignant cells.) I suppose there were countless women like Henrietta - women who had short and painful lives - but Henrietta's life has its own strange and unique immortality because she happened to be treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and her cancerous cells (now known as HeLa) have become the most famous and useful cells in human history.This book combines two different strands - one of them the medical advancements made possible by HeLa, and the other being the parallel existence of Henrietta's descendents. The fact that Henrietta Lacks was poor and black has nothing to do with her cells, but there is the vexed issue of medical experimentation being carried out on the vulnerable - and author Rebecca Skloot does a good job of contextualising this for the reader. Henrietta didn't knowingly contribute her body to the advancement of science, but the truth is that most of the amazing accomplishments and discoveries of the 20th century can be traced back to her cells. (There are many examples of this in the book, and you don't need an extensive knowledge of biology to understand Skloot's explanations.) Sadly, Henrietta's descendents have in no way benefited from the cash cow of HeLa and their collective story was absorbing and rather heartbreaking. The heart of the story is Deborah - a daughter who never knew her mother - and whose long, painful quest to learn the truth of the HeLa cells is really a personal journey of finding her lost mother.This was a fascinating study of social history and I found it to be a completely absorbing read. I don't tend to think of nonfiction as 'unputdownable', but that is how I would describe this book."
639,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,5,"Compelling and fascinating pageturner that weaves the unique and groundbreaking story behind the HeLa cells that have revolutionized medical science in the last century. Skloot puts a name, a face, and a rich family history around the cells of Henrietta Lacks, who the ""immortal"" cells were essentially stolen from in the 1950s after she started treatment for severe cervical cancer. Medical records, archival research, and oral history paint a vivid picture of the Lacks' family's struggles in 1950s Baltimore. Skloot tells the story first hand, as she meets the surviving members of the Lacks family, and becomes very close to Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah. The book details very painful events (specifically Henrietta's abysmal ""care"" in the hospital after her tumors were discovered, and the treatment of Henrietta's other daughter, Elsie, in the Home for the Negro Insane) in the Lacks' family history. Skloot travels to southern Virginia where Henrietta grew up, and where she is now buried. The personal side of the book is so captivating, and the way Skloot interweaves this story in with the scientific information is near seamless. It's very well-done and quite accessible for a non-scientific audience. I learned a lot about genetics and about the research that the famous HeLa cells have engendered. I particularly enjoyed the portion of the book when the researcher spent the day with Skloot and Deborah Lacks, explaining the true breakthroughs from the HeLa cell line. There is soome criticism (here on GoodReads as well) that the book spent too much time with the Lacks' descendants, but I would argue that this is a very important part of the book - noting that while the Jim Crow laws are not in place, and the legal system is more aware of scientific research and patient ""rights"", there have not been socioeconomic strides for science education and alleviation of poverty in these inner-city areas. Skloot provided a very important context to the story of HeLa by setting the scene with Deborah, Zecharia, Lawrence, and the ""cousins"" in rural Virginia. On a local note, it was very interesting to learn the details about the Lacks family and their history in the Baltimore region. I have lived near Baltimore (and even worked and took classes at the institution that plays a large - and unfortunate - role in this book) for years and did not know some of the things that were discussed. Even closer to home, I was moved, and saddened to learn about the tragedies that happened at the Crownsville hospital, which is near my parents' home, and where I went to high school. I didn't realize the full history of the institution. Very moving story, and it is highly recommended. "
640,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h,4,"Henrietta Lacks was a poor Southern woman and mother of five children who died in 1951 as the result of a remarkably aggressive form of cervical cancer. While undergoing radiation treatment, doctors at Johns Hopkins took samples of her cells without her consent, to better study the cancer. These cells, known as HeLa, became an important scientific and medical tool—they were the first ""immortal"" human cells grown in culture, and they are still alive today. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. But very little was known about the woman from whom these cells came, and her family was unaware of Henrietta's contributions to science for many, many years. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells Henrietta's story and chronicles the struggles of her family, most of whom never had the opportunity to even finish high school, to understand what cells were taken from her and what scientists were doing with them. Rebecca Skloot also gives a great deal of background into scientific research, particularly where cell and tissue study is concerned, and the challenges both the scientific and medical ethics communities face relative to ""donations"" of cells taken from patients. But in the end, this is the story of Henrietta's family and the emotions that the discovery of her role in science uncovers. While the subject of this book is very scientific, much of it reads like a novel. It is a fantastic story—sometimes shocking, sometimes heartbreaking—but Skloot gives depth not only to Henrietta and her family, but the researchers who both studied and questioned the HeLa cells through the years. When this book was released last year to tremendous acclaim, I didn't think it would interest me much, but a friend recently recommended it, and I'm glad I was motivated to pick it up. Don't be put off by the subject matter; in the end, this will pique your curiosity and tug at your heart. And you'll definitely look with a different eye at the next medical procedure you have! "
641,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,4,"An important story, well-told by Rebecca Skloot, this book is about Henrietta Lacks and her cancerous cells that are known as the HeLa line. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was a poor, uneducated black woman living with her husband and five young children in Baltimore when she developed cervical cancer and soon died. Without her knowledge or consent, cells from her cancer were cultured, distributed, and used in thousands of experiments continuing to this day, including pivotal developments in research about polio, radiation exposure, cancer, and more. The book successfully juxtaposes scientific information about the cells with the story of Henrietta's family and their fractured relationship with the medical establishment. The family was hounded by researchers who wanted DNA samples, without ever explaining what it was all about or offering any medical treatment to Henrietta's children who cope with multiple chronic diseases and no health insurance. Angry at what she sees as arrogant white doctors' appropriation of her mother, Henrietta's daughter Deborah asks, ""If our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can't afford to see no doctors?"" The experiences of another family member, a developmentally disabled daughter called Elsie, reveal even more disturbing truths about the medical treatment of African Americans in the recent past.While the science and history aspects of this book are worthwhile, what makes the book really engaging is the human story about Deborah coming to terms with these terrible discoveries. When I read The Help, I was disturbed by what I saw as that white author's attempt to insert herself into a heroic role in the story, rescuing the black characters and earning their gratitude. This book could easily fall into the same trap, but Skloot lets Deborah take center stage and shows when Deborah is angry or mistrustful of her. Skloot may lead Deborah to some of the facts about Henrietta and Elsie, but the accomplishment of processing them is all Deborah's."
642,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47767530-margo,5,"Reads as easily as a novel, but is non-fiction. Makes science accessible and interesting and tells the story of the Lacks family easily and honestly. A sometimes painful story, punctured with humor and emotion balanced by impeccable research into medical history. If you have not read it, I would highly recommend it.Sometimes I could not put it down and other times I had to put it down to digest either the raw emotions sometimes described or to absorb my reactions to the medical progress and medical ethics presented. Sometime the facts made me mad, other times it just amazed me how far we have progressed. I think I understood even more of the suspicion of poor, black families have of white, educated scientists and reporters. It made me angry but gave me a deeper understanding of the great gulf that has been created by procedures that took place at the time of Ms. Lacks cancer treatments on then use of her cells. "

647,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,5,"This book is amazing, being pretty well written and very interesting, and in addition, raising so many questions and issues related to research and our rights for our cells and tissues. Henrietta Lacks and her family's story is fascinating, and the topic as a whole still have many open questions.It would be an understatement to say that Henrietta Lacks is one of the most important people in science. The cells that were taken from her cervical cancer, are called HeLa and were used to develop the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects and so much more. Henrietta did not get a thank you, neither her family get recognition (or a medical insurance), she did not even get a marked grave. No permission was asked to use these cells, and not for commercializing them. People do not own the waste of their tissues, especially not poor colored people, right? Henrietta's cancer killed her very young, and left her children motherless. But science wouldn't be the same without her, and she lived through her cells helping to make giant progress.As Charles Dickens said at the beginning of [A] Tale of Two Cities, ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.’ But it was the best of times for science in that this very peculiar tumor gave rise to the HeLa cell line. … For Mrs. Lacks and the family she left behind, it was the worst of times. Scientific progress and indeed progress of all kinds is often made at great cost, such as the sacrifice made by Henrietta Lacks.Many scientists worked daily with HeLa cells, and didn't know or asked themselves where did these come from, and what is the story behind these important cells.He’d been working with HeLa cells daily his whole career, he said, and now he couldn’t get the story of Henrietta and her family out of his mind. Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, that lost her mother very young was furious. She did not know what exactly happened to her mother, or what is being done with her cells. She was rightly mad that her story, or even the recognition should be widely known. She was afraid, and being not very educated and going through very hard life, was paranoid from anybody that tried to talk to her about her mother, her medical files, or anything else related to it.“You know they shot my mother cells into space and blew her up with nuclear bombs? They even did that thing … what do you call it … um … cloning! … that’s right, they did that cloning on her.”... “You wouldn’t believe it,” she said. “You know they mixed her with mice to make a human-mouse? They say she’s not even human anymore!” She laughed a loud, manic laugh and ran to the window. “Holy cuss!”  But Deborah's fears weren't completely irrational. In the past black people were considered dispensable, their bodies were used for research, as they were slaves. And the Ku Klux Klan actually started as a threatening technique to prevent them from escaping from their owners. (I recommend The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration by Isabel Wilkerson to see how much more black people had to be afraid of, such as lynching). Just imagine trying on them surgical techniques without using anesthesia.Some of the stories were conjured by white plantation owners taking advantage of the long-held African belief that ghosts caused disease and death. To discourage slaves from meeting or escaping, slave owners told tales of gruesome research done on black bodies, then covered themselves in white sheets and crept around at night, posing as spirits coming to infect black people with disease or steal them for research. Those sheets eventually gave rise to the white hooded cloaks of the Ku Klux Klan. But night doctors weren’t just fictions conjured as scare tactics. Many doctors tested drugs on slaves and operated on them to develop new surgical techniques, often without using anesthesia. Fear of night doctors only increased in the early 1900s, as black people migrated north to Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, and news spread that medical schools there were offering money in exchange for bodies. Black corpses were routinely exhumed from graves for research, and an under ground shipping industry kept schools in the North supplied with black bodies from the South for anatomy courses. The bodies sometimes arrived, a dozen or so at a time, in barrels labeled turpentine.Prisoners were also a population that was under the threat of inhumane experiments on human beings. In some cases, they even signed up for the research, without really understanding what it means. Some would say that these are pretty similar to what the Nazis did. Cancer cell injections to inmates is just one exmaple of taking advantage of uneducated captured people for the good of science. Unimaginable in our world today that tries to prevent research on animals. Southam gave multiple cancer cell injections to each prisoner, and unlike the terminally ill patients, those men fought off the cancer completely. And with each new injection, their bodies responded faster, which seemed to indicate that the cells were increasing the inmates’ immunity to cancer. When Southam reported his results, the press hailed them as a tremendous breakthrough that could someday lead to a cancer vaccine. In the coming years, Southam injected HeLa and other living cancer cells into more than six hundred people for his research, about half of them cancer patients. He also began injecting them into every gynecologic surgery patient who came to Sloan-Kettering’s Memorial Hospital or its James Ewing Hospital. If he explained anything, he simply said he was testing them for cancer. And he believed he was: Since people with cancer seemed to reject the cells more slowly than healthy people did, Southam thought that by timing the rejection rate, he might be able to find undiagnosed cases of cancer.Coming back to the human right on the human body. Legislation around our user data, our documents etc is very advanced today. But what about our right for our cells and genes? Some claims about asking permission exclaimed that it would be against the progress of science, that it is just a human waste and therefore people don't have the right for it anymore. But it is probably not their place to decide, and the world is marching to defend people rights wherever it comes up. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a good start to fix the problems that still exist in this field.And there is a bright side, and Henrietta is an example that one person can have a giant impact on the world. Without education, money, or too much luck, she succeeded to get science to great breakthroughs.he pointed around the room at Davon and JaBrea’s other cousins, saying, “So will that child … and that child … and that child. This is their story now. They need to take hold of it and let it teach them they can change the world too.”5 stars for a woman bigger than life, and an important historical evolvement in an ever changing world."
648,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1206965-rach,5,"If I could give this book 10 stars, I would. It is an amazing story of Henrietta Lacks, whose cervical cancer cells became the first ""immortal"" cells in the study of human cell cultures. It covers the story of her life, death, and how her cells have changed science as we know it. In 1951, it was common for tissue to be taken without a patient's knowledge, especially when the patient was black. This book touches on how that simple fact changed a family's life. Much of the book discusses how it effected Henrietta's children once they found out that their mother's tumor had been taken and experimented on without her consent during the biopsy of the tumor. Upon her death, consent was given for an autopsy and some samples to be taken, but it was because her husband wasn't fully informed and thought that the tests would detect whether his and Henrietta's children had cancer.The book also discusses race issues and class issues that have touched the Lacks family's life. It discusses what care was common for black people in the early 50s and how many black people didn't get basic health care because they simply couldn't afford it and because it was well-known that black patients were often experimented on. It's heartbreaking to read about her family's complete misunderstanding of what had been done to their mother. When Henrietta's children were told about the fact that Henrietta's cells were still alive and being studied, 25 years after her death, they first thought that their mother had been kept alive all that time and was being experimented on. This wasn't because they were intellectually unable to understand it (as shown by how Deborah, Henrietta's surviving daughter, taught herself a lot of the science surrounding the testing done on the cell line established from Henrietta's cell sample), but because they were so poor that they weren't given basic science education and because of the lingering taint on the medical establishment that remained due to the Tuskegee airmen experiment and similar experiments. It's also heartbreaking to read about the fact that the Lacks' family had, at the time of the publishing of the book, no health insurance, even though their mother's cells have been sold and resold uncountable times.The race issues are also discussed when it comes to the care of Elsie, who was institutionalized when Henrietta became ill, because she was significantly developmentally disabled. Unfortunately, Elsie's life wasn't as well-documented as Henrietta's life, and many of her medical files were lost between the time of her death and when Skloot and Deborah begin their research into Elsie's life. But it's made clear that experiments were done on Elsie without the family's consent and that it was quite common at the time for experiments to be done on those in mental institutions.Lastly, this book touches on how the issue of the ownership of tissues taken for samples and payment for any treatments or cures to the owner of the tissues is evolving. As of right now, once you sign away the rights to your tissue, you sign away the monetary rights, but the law is still trying to find the ""right"" answer to this issue.I cannot recommend this book enough. Even if you're not interested in the scientific aspect of it, it's a book that should be read for the human side of the story, along with the medical ethics issues. I'll end with saying that there are some triggery things in this book, especially if you have issues surrounding medical things being done to you without your consent. But I think that should go without saying. Everything is handled as sensitively as possible, though. I found that the matter-of-fact matter in which Skloot writes makes it all a bit harder to digest, especially if you're very unused to these things being discussed so openly. But I think that style suits this story -- the things that happened to this family should make you uncomfortable. "
649,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin,4,"This book was excellent and I found myself totally drawn into Henrietta's story right from the first few pages. Rebecca Skloot is a journalist with a keen interest in discovering the truth behind the HeLa cells, the infamous cells that multiplied faster than any others in culture and made dozens of new scientific break-throughs possible. These cells were taken from Henrietta Lacks, a black woman diagnosed with cervical cancer, when she was being treated, without her knowledge, and long after her death they continue to be used world-wide. What I loved about this story was the raw personable tone to the writing. This book fully deserved to win the Wellcomebookprize in my eyes, becuase it was truly a wonder of storytelling, fact and fiction all wonderfully blended. Skloot manages to tell us the important details of science in a way that feels approachable and easy, whilst also showing the raw side of the deal that the Lacks family ended up with, and the emotional connection she herself had with the daughter of the family. This is truly a story that more people need to learn about and experience. A beautiful book, an informative piece of writing, and a very deserved winner of the prize in my eyes. Excellent, 4.5*s "

651,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38240230-dawn,5,"Such a profound book that was fascinating on so many levels: science, medicine, human interest, racism, and family. I have so many thoughts about this book I need to collect them before I write a proper review. Highly recommend."
652,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3258351-emily,2,"This book has already been lauded and reviewed to the moon and to the garbage can, which is where I think it should go. The story, as Skloot tells it, has already been told in articles and, briefly, in another book, but Skloot feels called to tell it again. Unfortunately, this is the very public story of a private individual and her family who have never consented to any of this and are tired of white people turning up on their doorstep looking for inside information. Skloot acknowledges this without stopping and finding a new hobby.Here's a far from complete list of problems with this book:So little science. It's written for your aunt's book club, but with Skloot's litany of, ""HeLa cells have been sent into space, blown up in an atom bomb, fought AIDS, etc,"" I would like to know how HeLa cells helped create bombs, for example. There's a little bit about cell reproduction and a little about the creation of the polio vaccine, but anything is exciting is when its blasted into space. Please explain how this was done. Use simple words. Use metaphors. But don't just say, ""Science happened.""My other problems are tied racism, mostly Skloot's. She drives through a Black Baltimore neighborhood for over an hour looking for a store without stopping because [stopping to ask black people for directions is scary]. She keeps waving at the same men. Children are running after her car. And she seeks a church for sanctuary.Formal address. Henrietta Lacks' children call Skloot ""Miss Rebecca."" (http://ask.metafilter.com/224268/Sout...) Skloot calls Henrietta Lacks and her relatives by their first names. Doctors and scientists are called by their last names.Mrs. Lacks' daughter Deborah makes an expository statement on doctors kidnapping and doing medical experiments on Blacks. Skloot explains at length why the medical establishment was not actually kidnapping Black people for the purpose of medical experimentation. Skloot does mention Tuskegee and some other documented incidents of non-consensual, fatal medical experiments; and later she and Deborah go to the Hospital for the Negro Insane, where Deborah's sister had horrific medical experiments performed on her. The kidnapping of Black people (Fugitive Slave Act, lynching, etc.) should be well known. But Skloot needs to refute, at length, Deborah's conflation of kidnapping and medical experiments. Aaargh! It is not up to the oppressed to determine which people are kidnapping them and which people are doing horrific medical experiments and then make the distinction between the two groups in casual conversation.And Skloot's treatment of Deborah in general. Skloot seems genuinely impressed by Deborah's research on HeLa cells, but she never goes so far as to help her, or connect her with a lawyer to look into the legitimacy of a suit against, say, Johns Hopkins for releasing Mrs. Lacks' medical records without consent. Skloot refuses to give a percentage of book sales to Mrs. Lacks' descendants directly, instead creating a scholarship fund of which she is the gatekeeper. And the last day Skloot and Deborah travel together, Skloot's describes Deborah's crazy, manic behavior as though it was a consistent with Deborah's normal self, even though Skloot learns the next day that Deborah was having a major medical episode that caused her to act erratically. The writing is bad. The progression of HeLa research through the Cold War era is appropriately chronological. But when Skloot comes on the scene, she describes everything in the order it happened to her, instead of pulling it together coherently and making it less of a travelogue into the lives of the Black people she was badgering.Also, Bahni Turpin does all the Black voices on the audiobook and another person reads the rest of the text. That might be an allegorical manifestation of the book itself. The white person speaks at length and freely, while the Black characters are handed a representation bone."
653,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2344676-neil,2,"I remember the first time I heard of Henrietta and her family's story; like Skloot, it was as a brief aside during a biology class and, like Skloot, it affected me much more than the teacher seemed to think it should. When I heard about Skloot's book, I was very interested.Unfortunately, Skloot's book's a bit of a mess, and the material itself makes the reasons why pretty clear. The idea has been gestating for at least 10 years, and she's probably been writing for at least five; she clearly had dozens of directions she wanted to go with the book - mainly, though, detailing the story of a wronged southern black family and talking about the injustices of the old South and telling the story of a cell line which have had a profound impact on science. Unfortunately, these two don't tie together in any significant way, and Skloot, probably because she spent so much time with the family and envisioned this book as a science-based human interest story, emphasizes, to the book's detriment, the human interest part (it may well be because - and I don't know because I don't know much about it - people familiar with science know of many accounts of the actual history of HeLa cells). To the point where we are finding out details of the lives of many of Henrietta's cousins and children and grandchildren, which just make the narrative a complete mess.Henrietta's story, too, is not particularly ethically complicated; she received what was proper treatment, and, though the biopsy was performed without her approval, it hardly added any pain to her situation, there was no malicious intent from the doctors, and indeed Skloot talks at one point about how little interest Gey, the scientist who originally worked with her cells, had in profit and instead how much he cared about the advancement of science at the expense of his own potential for patents, etc.Her narrative of the history of cell culture is interesting, but the science is massively toned down. She also tries to include silly stuff about religion v. science - she mentions some thoughts a little bit at the book's very beginning, but it disappears until the very end, at which point she has not at all established it as any sort of important consideration in this story.And, I really don't mean to go into ad hominem attacks here - Skloot seems well-intentioned and liberal-minded - but I feel that Skloot inserted herself into the story far too much. Like, with the whole storyline culminating in Deborah finally letting her look at the medical records, she seemed to paint herself as some sort of redeemer of all the prior sins against the Lacks family which she spent so long detailing. One particularly bizarre scene is when Deborah and her grandchildren ride to see Zakariyya (p. 242 in my version), and the grandchildren, whom Skloot described as ""strkingly beautiful"" say to Skloot both ""I love you"" and ""You're mine."" These eight lines could be stricken from the book without losing, you know, anything at all, but Skloot, a writing teacher, should know that every detail should be in a narrative for a reason. What is the reason here? It's strange. Why does she insist we see how much she is loved by the children, especially in this flirtatious way?"

While the content will most likely leave readers feeling a whole range of emotions from sadness to anger, the actual content of this book is something that needs to be read by all people regardless of color, age, or background. While there are parts of the story that seem exploitative (I honestly felt as if Skloot sometimes went into too much detail about different parts of the Lacks' family's dysfunction when describing individuals who are currently living), the overall story of Henrietta Lacks' body being defiled and her cells taken without her or her family's consent all in the name of science is something that everyone should read up on."

There's been a lot of profit derived from them that has never reached them.2. THIS is how you tell a story. It's not contrived. It's complex. She doesn't tell us what to think (that much), but lays out the story in such a way that your own thoughts and emotions fill that last crucial gap. 3. I'm so grateful for HELA. Man, thank God for science!4. I was a bit uncomfortable with the way Skloot characterized the family. There was warmth and tenderness, but also a bit of exotification or ""otherness"" to the way she covered them. 5. Having watched Get Out, I thought about this story differently "

I loved how Rebecca Skloot combined the scientific and familial aspects of this book to make a work of non-fiction seem like it was a fiction novel. Also, she included her own personal aspects, showing her struggle through the research process and learning about Henrietta's family. I personally think that science and medicine is fascinating (as I want to study either pediatrics or dermatology), so I am very glad that I was required to read this book for school as it exposed me to HeLa cells and both the impact that they made on the scientific community and on Henrietta Lack's family.

I’m pretty ignorant to the inner workings of the medical research world but the ethics of using cells seems pretty clear. I’m thrilled HeLa cells have lead to epic medical breakthroughs and continue to help find cures for cancer, etc. but what the Lacks family has gone through when their mother’s cells are involved is heartbreaking. Currently, HeLa cells are being used to try and find a cure and vaccine for Covid-19. The widespread medical advances that were/are possible thanks to Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells are staggering and a blessing. So reading about her family, too poor to afford health care and medicine their mother’s cells likely helped develop is just shitty. Still, I’m so happy I read this book and educated myself. TW: (severe) child abuse, graphic medical situations, cancer, molestation, pedophilia, incest, mistreatment if mentally handicapped in hospital settings in 50s, mistreatment, abuse, and murder of black people at the hands of the medical field, murder, drug use, cheating, domestic abuse... this isn’t an easy read, friends.

663,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol,5,"Skloot, Rebecca - The Immortal Life of Henrietta LacksThis has been on my TBR list for most of the year. I knew I wanted to read it as soon as I heard it involved The HeLa Cells. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew I had heard about these famous cells taken from an African American woman diagnosed with cervical cancer in the 50’s. The cells were taken without her knowledge and without the knowledge of her family. The cells lived, she did not. Meet Henrietta Lacks.Like the author, Rebecca Skloot, I was curious to know more about Henrietta, to learn more about the details of the cell experimentations, what they have done for science and why they are important to our lives. Skloot is a science journalist and has the credentials to dig into the story and inform. I give her a great deal of credit for the ten years she took to research the book and for having the perseverance to continue to contact Henrietta’s relatives who were reluctant to talk to a reporter. Building trust with the family was not an easy task, but eventually Skloot was able to ensure them that her intentions were good. Though the story could have been told from interviews with doctors and possibly from records at Johns Hopkins, what really brings Henrietta alive in my mind is the personal stories of her kin, particularly her daughter, Deborah. I liked the format Skloot used to write the book. You can hear what she says about this in the FAQ portion of her website.Critics of the book complain that Skloot has made this a story of race. Personally, I don’t see how you can begin to know Henrietta and her family without talking about race. But, yes, it is more than that. It’s about informed consent, pharmaceutical companies making mega dollars, treatment of patients, and ethics. It is also the story of the quest of a daughter to better know her mother, who died when she was young. It is a story of this daughter’s love for the woman she comes to know. I am pleased that Rebecca Skloot has set up Henrietta Lacks Foundation, which this year granted five of the Lacks descendents for their education. There is much to think about after reading this book. I still have questions. Some of the science goes over my head, but Skloot did a good job keeping this in layman’s terms. Today, due to privacy laws we would not know the name of the woman that the cells were harvested from. I’m in agreement with this but am still glad that in this case, Henrietta Lacks was identified and that through the efforts of Rebecca Skloot that I have a better picture of who Henrietta was. She never knew her contribution to medicine, but it seems to be significant. "
664,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/287912-melissa,2,"I'm having a hard time accepting the fundamental premise of this book; that because Henrietta Lacks's cancer cells continue to grow and have since the 50s, she herself is somehow still alive. Because she's not. And these are cancer cells anyway - of her body, but not of her personally. If you scraped a cancer cell out of me, it wouldn't take care of my kid or go to work for me, so why would you say that I was still alive? I think a lot of Deborah Lacks's heartache might've been averted if this myth of Henrietta's aliveness hadn't been perpetuated. Without being told that her mother was still ""alive"", she'd have no need to stress out to the point of almost stroking out about her mother still being able to feel the pain of an atomic bomb blast, the pain of cancer treatment drugs, AIDS drugs, etc. I'm in no way denying the achievement of HeLa cells or what they've done to further scientific achievement, I just can't buy that their existence means that Henrietta Lacks is still alive.

665,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10942210-john,4,Wow. I was enthralled during the first half of the book but it started to drag at the end. Definetly lost its magic of storytelling at the end and almost sounded just like retyped journal notes. BUT this tells an important story that should be required for all medical scientists.

666,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31167656-bookworm,4,A well researched and exquisitely told story. I listened to the audio which was highly entertaining. Absolutely fascinating! It's hard to believe this happened in the 1950's!!
667,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2299298-pages-for-breakfast-x1f4da-formerly-readage,5,"From my blog: https://bookgirl1987thoughts.wordpres...I'm sure many of you have already read this book, as it was published in early 2010 and made headlines as a bestselling piece of medical/science nonfiction. Rebecca Skloot is an award-winning science writer who became interested in the story of Henrietta Lacks (known as HeLa in the medical/scientific community) when she took a biology course at sixteen that changed her outlook on the world of science forever. Her instructor wrote the name HENRIETTA LACKS as he was discussing cell culture and Skloot was anxious to investigate. Her HeLa fascination started there, and continued throughout her graduate school studies in writing, as she contemplated researching and writing about Henrietta Lacks. Eventually, she put pen to paper and brought HeLa's story to light.The book is a wonderfully written, and in my opinion, smartly-paced piece of nonfiction. It does a masterful job of detailing Skloot's heavy involvement in the HeLa chaos that resulted from an unethical medical treatment on a poverty-stricken black woman from Virginia in 1951. If you decide to read this book, (and I really hope you do), in the first half of the narrative you will meet a lovely, sweet woman named Henrietta Lacks and discover that she is suffering from a particularly aggressive form of cervical cancer. Diagnosed at the tender age of 30, Henrietta's cancer spreads rapidly and cuts short her life in a tragic flash, leaving behind a husband, five children, and surrounding family members who eventually live in the upsetting wake of Henrietta's undisclosed, yet amazing contribution to science.(I dislike book reviews that give blow-by-blow, page-by-page details of the book; I want you to read the book, not just this review, so I refrain here from delving too deeply into the scientific material you will find in the book.) I do want to reassure any ambivalent readers that this is an incredibly entertaining science book, without being overly scientific or stuffy in any way! It is very accessible to readers of all scientific knowledge, and will most definitely appeal to people who know absolutely nothing about cellular biology and cell cultures. (It explains things along the way). I started this book hoping the information would not go right over my head, and I'm pleased to say that none of the concepts escaped me intellectually. From a scientific perspective, Skloot has written an informative history of the HeLa cells, and that alone makes this book rewarding.However, I must say that the human element of the book is the author's number one achievement. Meeting the Lacks family members, one by one, and learning of their daily lives and coping mechanisms was even more interesting to me than the amazing science behind the HeLa phenomenon. Once you absorb and process the initial shock in the first half of the book of how radical HeLa cells truly are, you begin to settle into a second half of the narrative that just grabs your heart and doesn't let go until the last page. Skloot skips back and forth in time, and it was an interesting way to tell the story. We have a few chapters detailing events in 1951 when Henrietta was alive and in the thick of her illness, and then we flash forward to 1999 and onward to events in the author's life as she makes connections with the Lacks family and begins her very hands-on research. (Personally, I didn't find the structure detracting in any way; I felt that it kept the HeLa history very rooted and upfront in the successive decades and chapters, therefore not allowing the reader to lose sight of the very real woman and family behind the science and medical discoveries.)Speaking further of the sincerely human element of the book, Deborah Lacks was my absolute favorite part of the book! (I won't go so far as to say that she overshadowed her mother in the narrative, but I admit that she really did manage to catapult me that much further into the story). The initial portrait of Henrietta Lacks begins the story, and when her daughter Deborah steps in later in the book, you really get the sense that Deborah is trying her damndest to resolve the chaos and confusion that factor so strongly in the book. Henrietta is no longer around to speak for herself, but her cells do much of the ""talking"" in this book, and Deborah's voice rings just as true and sincere as her mother's biological determinism.I'm going to wrap up here, because the longer I spend on this review, the longer you might spend reading about it instead of picking up the book! I strongly recommend that you find a copy of the audiobook of ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" by Rebecca Skloot narrated by Cassandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin. I read along and listened to this awesome recording and am so glad I did. I feel like the characters really came alive with this audiobook narration. The voices are very expressive, and I think you will enjoy it!"

I've had it on my shelf for years, and my daughter - who loves nonfiction - had read it and raved about it. But I'm a big believer in that some books just bide their time, waiting for the right moment, and perhaps this was true of this book. Just before reading this book, I saw the documentary Thirteenth, and I couldn't help but think of how Henrietta Lacks' family history is the living embodiment of the painful, tragic history of African Americans in the United States. Thirteenth traces the history of African Americans: from the 'official' end of slavery in January 31, 1865, when the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution abolished slavery except as a punishment for a crime, to the present day. It's an incredibly thought-provoking documentary and it makes the persuasive case that African Americans (or people of color, as they are usually referred to in the documentary) have never truly transcended their second-class citizen status. Every time one societal change is made, racism mutates (rather like a cancerous cell) to become a different and yet still malignant disease.Henrietta was born in Roanoke, Virginia on August 18, 1920. She was only four years old when her mother died giving birth to her 10th child. Henrietta was then raised by her grandfather, along with a slightly older first cousin called 'Day'. They lived on a tobacco farm, and from an early age the children helped pick and cure the tobacco leaves. When Henrietta was 14, she became pregnant for the first time; Day was the father. By age 31, Henrietta was dead. She had given birth to 5 children, and died of cervical cancer after a swift and painful illness. (Henrietta had the most virulent form of the HPV virus, and a vaccine for this virus was made possible by the research done with her malignant cells.) I suppose there were countless women like Henrietta - women who had short and painful lives - but Henrietta's life has its own strange and unique immortality because she happened to be treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and her cancerous cells (now known as HeLa) have become the most famous and useful cells in human history.This book combines two different strands - one of them the medical advancements made possible by HeLa, and the other being the parallel existence of Henrietta's descendents. The fact that Henrietta Lacks was poor and black has nothing to do with her cells, but there is the vexed issue of medical experimentation being carried out on the vulnerable - and author Rebecca Skloot does a good job of contextualising this for the reader. Henrietta didn't knowingly contribute her body to the advancement of science, but the truth is that most of the amazing accomplishments and discoveries of the 20th century can be traced back to her cells. (There are many examples of this in the book, and you don't need an extensive knowledge of biology to understand Skloot's explanations.) Sadly, Henrietta's descendents have in no way benefited from the cash cow of HeLa and their collective story was absorbing and rather heartbreaking. The heart of the story is Deborah - a daughter who never knew her mother - and whose long, painful quest to learn the truth of the HeLa cells is really a personal journey of finding her lost mother.This was a fascinating study of social history and I found it to be a completely absorbing read. I don't tend to think of nonfiction as 'unputdownable', but that is how I would describe this book."
669,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,5,"Compelling and fascinating pageturner that weaves the unique and groundbreaking story behind the HeLa cells that have revolutionized medical science in the last century. Skloot puts a name, a face, and a rich family history around the cells of Henrietta Lacks, who the ""immortal"" cells were essentially stolen from in the 1950s after she started treatment for severe cervical cancer. Medical records, archival research, and oral history paint a vivid picture of the Lacks' family's struggles in 1950s Baltimore. Skloot tells the story first hand, as she meets the surviving members of the Lacks family, and becomes very close to Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah. The book details very painful events (specifically Henrietta's abysmal ""care"" in the hospital after her tumors were discovered, and the treatment of Henrietta's other daughter, Elsie, in the Home for the Negro Insane) in the Lacks' family history. Skloot travels to southern Virginia where Henrietta grew up, and where she is now buried. The personal side of the book is so captivating, and the way Skloot interweaves this story in with the scientific information is near seamless. It's very well-done and quite accessible for a non-scientific audience. I learned a lot about genetics and about the research that the famous HeLa cells have engendered. I particularly enjoyed the portion of the book when the researcher spent the day with Skloot and Deborah Lacks, explaining the true breakthroughs from the HeLa cell line. There is soome criticism (here on GoodReads as well) that the book spent too much time with the Lacks' descendants, but I would argue that this is a very important part of the book - noting that while the Jim Crow laws are not in place, and the legal system is more aware of scientific research and patient ""rights"", there have not been socioeconomic strides for science education and alleviation of poverty in these inner-city areas. Skloot provided a very important context to the story of HeLa by setting the scene with Deborah, Zecharia, Lawrence, and the ""cousins"" in rural Virginia. On a local note, it was very interesting to learn the details about the Lacks family and their history in the Baltimore region. I have lived near Baltimore (and even worked and took classes at the institution that plays a large - and unfortunate - role in this book) for years and did not know some of the things that were discussed. Even closer to home, I was moved, and saddened to learn about the tragedies that happened at the Crownsville hospital, which is near my parents' home, and where I went to high school. I didn't realize the full history of the institution. Very moving story, and it is highly recommended. "
670,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h,4,"Henrietta Lacks was a poor Southern woman and mother of five children who died in 1951 as the result of a remarkably aggressive form of cervical cancer. While undergoing radiation treatment, doctors at Johns Hopkins took samples of her cells without her consent, to better study the cancer. These cells, known as HeLa, became an important scientific and medical tool—they were the first ""immortal"" human cells grown in culture, and they are still alive today. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. But very little was known about the woman from whom these cells came, and her family was unaware of Henrietta's contributions to science for many, many years. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells Henrietta's story and chronicles the struggles of her family, most of whom never had the opportunity to even finish high school, to understand what cells were taken from her and what scientists were doing with them. Rebecca Skloot also gives a great deal of background into scientific research, particularly where cell and tissue study is concerned, and the challenges both the scientific and medical ethics communities face relative to ""donations"" of cells taken from patients. But in the end, this is the story of Henrietta's family and the emotions that the discovery of her role in science uncovers. While the subject of this book is very scientific, much of it reads like a novel. It is a fantastic story—sometimes shocking, sometimes heartbreaking—but Skloot gives depth not only to Henrietta and her family, but the researchers who both studied and questioned the HeLa cells through the years. When this book was released last year to tremendous acclaim, I didn't think it would interest me much, but a friend recently recommended it, and I'm glad I was motivated to pick it up. Don't be put off by the subject matter; in the end, this will pique your curiosity and tug at your heart. And you'll definitely look with a different eye at the next medical procedure you have! "
671,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,4,"An important story, well-told by Rebecca Skloot, this book is about Henrietta Lacks and her cancerous cells that are known as the HeLa line. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was a poor, uneducated black woman living with her husband and five young children in Baltimore when she developed cervical cancer and soon died. Without her knowledge or consent, cells from her cancer were cultured, distributed, and used in thousands of experiments continuing to this day, including pivotal developments in research about polio, radiation exposure, cancer, and more. The book successfully juxtaposes scientific information about the cells with the story of Henrietta's family and their fractured relationship with the medical establishment. The family was hounded by researchers who wanted DNA samples, without ever explaining what it was all about or offering any medical treatment to Henrietta's children who cope with multiple chronic diseases and no health insurance. Angry at what she sees as arrogant white doctors' appropriation of her mother, Henrietta's daughter Deborah asks, ""If our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can't afford to see no doctors?"" The experiences of another family member, a developmentally disabled daughter called Elsie, reveal even more disturbing truths about the medical treatment of African Americans in the recent past.While the science and history aspects of this book are worthwhile, what makes the book really engaging is the human story about Deborah coming to terms with these terrible discoveries. When I read The Help, I was disturbed by what I saw as that white author's attempt to insert herself into a heroic role in the story, rescuing the black characters and earning their gratitude. This book could easily fall into the same trap, but Skloot lets Deborah take center stage and shows when Deborah is angry or mistrustful of her. Skloot may lead Deborah to some of the facts about Henrietta and Elsie, but the accomplishment of processing them is all Deborah's."
672,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47767530-margo,5,"Reads as easily as a novel, but is non-fiction. Makes science accessible and interesting and tells the story of the Lacks family easily and honestly. A sometimes painful story, punctured with humor and emotion balanced by impeccable research into medical history. If you have not read it, I would highly recommend it.Sometimes I could not put it down and other times I had to put it down to digest either the raw emotions sometimes described or to absorb my reactions to the medical progress and medical ethics presented. Sometime the facts made me mad, other times it just amazed me how far we have progressed. I think I understood even more of the suspicion of poor, black families have of white, educated scientists and reporters. It made me angry but gave me a deeper understanding of the great gulf that has been created by procedures that took place at the time of Ms. Lacks cancer treatments on then use of her cells. "

677,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,5,"This book is amazing, being pretty well written and very interesting, and in addition, raising so many questions and issues related to research and our rights for our cells and tissues. Henrietta Lacks and her family's story is fascinating, and the topic as a whole still have many open questions.It would be an understatement to say that Henrietta Lacks is one of the most important people in science. The cells that were taken from her cervical cancer, are called HeLa and were used to develop the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects and so much more. Henrietta did not get a thank you, neither her family get recognition (or a medical insurance), she did not even get a marked grave. No permission was asked to use these cells, and not for commercializing them. People do not own the waste of their tissues, especially not poor colored people, right? Henrietta's cancer killed her very young, and left her children motherless. But science wouldn't be the same without her, and she lived through her cells helping to make giant progress.As Charles Dickens said at the beginning of [A] Tale of Two Cities, ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.’ But it was the best of times for science in that this very peculiar tumor gave rise to the HeLa cell line. … For Mrs. Lacks and the family she left behind, it was the worst of times. Scientific progress and indeed progress of all kinds is often made at great cost, such as the sacrifice made by Henrietta Lacks.Many scientists worked daily with HeLa cells, and didn't know or asked themselves where did these come from, and what is the story behind these important cells.He’d been working with HeLa cells daily his whole career, he said, and now he couldn’t get the story of Henrietta and her family out of his mind. Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, that lost her mother very young was furious. She did not know what exactly happened to her mother, or what is being done with her cells. She was rightly mad that her story, or even the recognition should be widely known. She was afraid, and being not very educated and going through very hard life, was paranoid from anybody that tried to talk to her about her mother, her medical files, or anything else related to it.“You know they shot my mother cells into space and blew her up with nuclear bombs? They even did that thing … what do you call it … um … cloning! … that’s right, they did that cloning on her.”... “You wouldn’t believe it,” she said. “You know they mixed her with mice to make a human-mouse? They say she’s not even human anymore!” She laughed a loud, manic laugh and ran to the window. “Holy cuss!”  But Deborah's fears weren't completely irrational. In the past black people were considered dispensable, their bodies were used for research, as they were slaves. And the Ku Klux Klan actually started as a threatening technique to prevent them from escaping from their owners. (I recommend The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration by Isabel Wilkerson to see how much more black people had to be afraid of, such as lynching). Just imagine trying on them surgical techniques without using anesthesia.Some of the stories were conjured by white plantation owners taking advantage of the long-held African belief that ghosts caused disease and death. To discourage slaves from meeting or escaping, slave owners told tales of gruesome research done on black bodies, then covered themselves in white sheets and crept around at night, posing as spirits coming to infect black people with disease or steal them for research. Those sheets eventually gave rise to the white hooded cloaks of the Ku Klux Klan. But night doctors weren’t just fictions conjured as scare tactics. Many doctors tested drugs on slaves and operated on them to develop new surgical techniques, often without using anesthesia. Fear of night doctors only increased in the early 1900s, as black people migrated north to Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, and news spread that medical schools there were offering money in exchange for bodies. Black corpses were routinely exhumed from graves for research, and an under ground shipping industry kept schools in the North supplied with black bodies from the South for anatomy courses. The bodies sometimes arrived, a dozen or so at a time, in barrels labeled turpentine.Prisoners were also a population that was under the threat of inhumane experiments on human beings. In some cases, they even signed up for the research, without really understanding what it means. Some would say that these are pretty similar to what the Nazis did. Cancer cell injections to inmates is just one exmaple of taking advantage of uneducated captured people for the good of science. Unimaginable in our world today that tries to prevent research on animals. Southam gave multiple cancer cell injections to each prisoner, and unlike the terminally ill patients, those men fought off the cancer completely. And with each new injection, their bodies responded faster, which seemed to indicate that the cells were increasing the inmates’ immunity to cancer. When Southam reported his results, the press hailed them as a tremendous breakthrough that could someday lead to a cancer vaccine. In the coming years, Southam injected HeLa and other living cancer cells into more than six hundred people for his research, about half of them cancer patients. He also began injecting them into every gynecologic surgery patient who came to Sloan-Kettering’s Memorial Hospital or its James Ewing Hospital. If he explained anything, he simply said he was testing them for cancer. And he believed he was: Since people with cancer seemed to reject the cells more slowly than healthy people did, Southam thought that by timing the rejection rate, he might be able to find undiagnosed cases of cancer.Coming back to the human right on the human body. Legislation around our user data, our documents etc is very advanced today. But what about our right for our cells and genes? Some claims about asking permission exclaimed that it would be against the progress of science, that it is just a human waste and therefore people don't have the right for it anymore. But it is probably not their place to decide, and the world is marching to defend people rights wherever it comes up. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a good start to fix the problems that still exist in this field.And there is a bright side, and Henrietta is an example that one person can have a giant impact on the world. Without education, money, or too much luck, she succeeded to get science to great breakthroughs.he pointed around the room at Davon and JaBrea’s other cousins, saying, “So will that child … and that child … and that child. This is their story now. They need to take hold of it and let it teach them they can change the world too.”5 stars for a woman bigger than life, and an important historical evolvement in an ever changing world."
678,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1206965-rach,5,"If I could give this book 10 stars, I would. It is an amazing story of Henrietta Lacks, whose cervical cancer cells became the first ""immortal"" cells in the study of human cell cultures. It covers the story of her life, death, and how her cells have changed science as we know it. In 1951, it was common for tissue to be taken without a patient's knowledge, especially when the patient was black. This book touches on how that simple fact changed a family's life. Much of the book discusses how it effected Henrietta's children once they found out that their mother's tumor had been taken and experimented on without her consent during the biopsy of the tumor. Upon her death, consent was given for an autopsy and some samples to be taken, but it was because her husband wasn't fully informed and thought that the tests would detect whether his and Henrietta's children had cancer.The book also discusses race issues and class issues that have touched the Lacks family's life. It discusses what care was common for black people in the early 50s and how many black people didn't get basic health care because they simply couldn't afford it and because it was well-known that black patients were often experimented on. It's heartbreaking to read about her family's complete misunderstanding of what had been done to their mother. When Henrietta's children were told about the fact that Henrietta's cells were still alive and being studied, 25 years after her death, they first thought that their mother had been kept alive all that time and was being experimented on. This wasn't because they were intellectually unable to understand it (as shown by how Deborah, Henrietta's surviving daughter, taught herself a lot of the science surrounding the testing done on the cell line established from Henrietta's cell sample), but because they were so poor that they weren't given basic science education and because of the lingering taint on the medical establishment that remained due to the Tuskegee airmen experiment and similar experiments. It's also heartbreaking to read about the fact that the Lacks' family had, at the time of the publishing of the book, no health insurance, even though their mother's cells have been sold and resold uncountable times.The race issues are also discussed when it comes to the care of Elsie, who was institutionalized when Henrietta became ill, because she was significantly developmentally disabled. Unfortunately, Elsie's life wasn't as well-documented as Henrietta's life, and many of her medical files were lost between the time of her death and when Skloot and Deborah begin their research into Elsie's life. But it's made clear that experiments were done on Elsie without the family's consent and that it was quite common at the time for experiments to be done on those in mental institutions.Lastly, this book touches on how the issue of the ownership of tissues taken for samples and payment for any treatments or cures to the owner of the tissues is evolving. As of right now, once you sign away the rights to your tissue, you sign away the monetary rights, but the law is still trying to find the ""right"" answer to this issue.I cannot recommend this book enough. Even if you're not interested in the scientific aspect of it, it's a book that should be read for the human side of the story, along with the medical ethics issues. I'll end with saying that there are some triggery things in this book, especially if you have issues surrounding medical things being done to you without your consent. But I think that should go without saying. Everything is handled as sensitively as possible, though. I found that the matter-of-fact matter in which Skloot writes makes it all a bit harder to digest, especially if you're very unused to these things being discussed so openly. But I think that style suits this story -- the things that happened to this family should make you uncomfortable. "
679,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin,4,"This book was excellent and I found myself totally drawn into Henrietta's story right from the first few pages. Rebecca Skloot is a journalist with a keen interest in discovering the truth behind the HeLa cells, the infamous cells that multiplied faster than any others in culture and made dozens of new scientific break-throughs possible. These cells were taken from Henrietta Lacks, a black woman diagnosed with cervical cancer, when she was being treated, without her knowledge, and long after her death they continue to be used world-wide. What I loved about this story was the raw personable tone to the writing. This book fully deserved to win the Wellcomebookprize in my eyes, becuase it was truly a wonder of storytelling, fact and fiction all wonderfully blended. Skloot manages to tell us the important details of science in a way that feels approachable and easy, whilst also showing the raw side of the deal that the Lacks family ended up with, and the emotional connection she herself had with the daughter of the family. This is truly a story that more people need to learn about and experience. A beautiful book, an informative piece of writing, and a very deserved winner of the prize in my eyes. Excellent, 4.5*s "

682,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3258351-emily,2,"This book has already been lauded and reviewed to the moon and to the garbage can, which is where I think it should go. The story, as Skloot tells it, has already been told in articles and, briefly, in another book, but Skloot feels called to tell it again. Unfortunately, this is the very public story of a private individual and her family who have never consented to any of this and are tired of white people turning up on their doorstep looking for inside information. Skloot acknowledges this without stopping and finding a new hobby.Here's a far from complete list of problems with this book:So little science. It's written for your aunt's book club, but with Skloot's litany of, ""HeLa cells have been sent into space, blown up in an atom bomb, fought AIDS, etc,"" I would like to know how HeLa cells helped create bombs, for example. There's a little bit about cell reproduction and a little about the creation of the polio vaccine, but anything is exciting is when its blasted into space. Please explain how this was done. Use simple words. Use metaphors. But don't just say, ""Science happened.""My other problems are tied racism, mostly Skloot's. She drives through a Black Baltimore neighborhood for over an hour looking for a store without stopping because [stopping to ask black people for directions is scary]. She keeps waving at the same men. Children are running after her car. And she seeks a church for sanctuary.Formal address. Henrietta Lacks' children call Skloot ""Miss Rebecca."" (http://ask.metafilter.com/224268/Sout...) Skloot calls Henrietta Lacks and her relatives by their first names. Doctors and scientists are called by their last names.Mrs. Lacks' daughter Deborah makes an expository statement on doctors kidnapping and doing medical experiments on Blacks. Skloot explains at length why the medical establishment was not actually kidnapping Black people for the purpose of medical experimentation. Skloot does mention Tuskegee and some other documented incidents of non-consensual, fatal medical experiments; and later she and Deborah go to the Hospital for the Negro Insane, where Deborah's sister had horrific medical experiments performed on her. The kidnapping of Black people (Fugitive Slave Act, lynching, etc.) should be well known. But Skloot needs to refute, at length, Deborah's conflation of kidnapping and medical experiments. Aaargh! It is not up to the oppressed to determine which people are kidnapping them and which people are doing horrific medical experiments and then make the distinction between the two groups in casual conversation.And Skloot's treatment of Deborah in general. Skloot seems genuinely impressed by Deborah's research on HeLa cells, but she never goes so far as to help her, or connect her with a lawyer to look into the legitimacy of a suit against, say, Johns Hopkins for releasing Mrs. Lacks' medical records without consent. Skloot refuses to give a percentage of book sales to Mrs. Lacks' descendants directly, instead creating a scholarship fund of which she is the gatekeeper. And the last day Skloot and Deborah travel together, Skloot's describes Deborah's crazy, manic behavior as though it was a consistent with Deborah's normal self, even though Skloot learns the next day that Deborah was having a major medical episode that caused her to act erratically. The writing is bad. The progression of HeLa research through the Cold War era is appropriately chronological. But when Skloot comes on the scene, she describes everything in the order it happened to her, instead of pulling it together coherently and making it less of a travelogue into the lives of the Black people she was badgering.Also, Bahni Turpin does all the Black voices on the audiobook and another person reads the rest of the text. That might be an allegorical manifestation of the book itself. The white person speaks at length and freely, while the Black characters are handed a representation bone."
683,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2344676-neil,2,"I remember the first time I heard of Henrietta and her family's story; like Skloot, it was as a brief aside during a biology class and, like Skloot, it affected me much more than the teacher seemed to think it should. When I heard about Skloot's book, I was very interested.Unfortunately, Skloot's book's a bit of a mess, and the material itself makes the reasons why pretty clear. The idea has been gestating for at least 10 years, and she's probably been writing for at least five; she clearly had dozens of directions she wanted to go with the book - mainly, though, detailing the story of a wronged southern black family and talking about the injustices of the old South and telling the story of a cell line which have had a profound impact on science. Unfortunately, these two don't tie together in any significant way, and Skloot, probably because she spent so much time with the family and envisioned this book as a science-based human interest story, emphasizes, to the book's detriment, the human interest part (it may well be because - and I don't know because I don't know much about it - people familiar with science know of many accounts of the actual history of HeLa cells). To the point where we are finding out details of the lives of many of Henrietta's cousins and children and grandchildren, which just make the narrative a complete mess.Henrietta's story, too, is not particularly ethically complicated; she received what was proper treatment, and, though the biopsy was performed without her approval, it hardly added any pain to her situation, there was no malicious intent from the doctors, and indeed Skloot talks at one point about how little interest Gey, the scientist who originally worked with her cells, had in profit and instead how much he cared about the advancement of science at the expense of his own potential for patents, etc.Her narrative of the history of cell culture is interesting, but the science is massively toned down. She also tries to include silly stuff about religion v. science - she mentions some thoughts a little bit at the book's very beginning, but it disappears until the very end, at which point she has not at all established it as any sort of important consideration in this story.And, I really don't mean to go into ad hominem attacks here - Skloot seems well-intentioned and liberal-minded - but I feel that Skloot inserted herself into the story far too much. Like, with the whole storyline culminating in Deborah finally letting her look at the medical records, she seemed to paint herself as some sort of redeemer of all the prior sins against the Lacks family which she spent so long detailing. One particularly bizarre scene is when Deborah and her grandchildren ride to see Zakariyya (p. 242 in my version), and the grandchildren, whom Skloot described as ""strkingly beautiful"" say to Skloot both ""I love you"" and ""You're mine."" These eight lines could be stricken from the book without losing, you know, anything at all, but Skloot, a writing teacher, should know that every detail should be in a narrative for a reason. What is the reason here? It's strange. Why does she insist we see how much she is loved by the children, especially in this flirtatious way?"

The individuals in this books are real life people who have had a grave injustice done to their family. While the content will most likely leave readers feeling a whole range of emotions from sadness to anger, the actual content of this book is something that needs to be read by all people regardless of color, age, or background. While there are parts of the story that seem exploitative (I honestly felt as if Skloot sometimes went into too much detail about different parts of the Lacks' family's dysfunction when describing individuals who are currently living), the overall story of Henrietta Lacks' body being defiled and her cells taken without her or her family's consent all in the name of science is something that everyone should read up on."

There's been a lot of profit derived from them that has never reached them.2. THIS is how you tell a story. It's not contrived. It's complex. She doesn't tell us what to think (that much), but lays out the story in such a way that your own thoughts and emotions fill that last crucial gap. 3. I'm so grateful for HELA. Man, thank God for science!4. I was a bit uncomfortable with the way Skloot characterized the family. There was warmth and tenderness, but also a bit of exotification or ""otherness"" to the way she covered them. 5. Having watched Get Out, I thought about this story differently "

I personally think that science and medicine is fascinating (as I want to study either pediatrics or dermatology), so I am very glad that I was required to read this book for school as it exposed me to HeLa cells and both the impact that they made on the scientific community and on Henrietta Lack's family.

690,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,5,"Henrietta Lacks is a woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951. The cells cut from her body, because of their aptitude for growth and replication, still play a significant role in treating disease and other medical tests. She did not know her cells were being used, and her family did not benefit financially. The author writes extensively about her family, as they were a crucial source for the book. Because of so many trust relationships violated over the years, she had to first work to build trust and prove herself reliable. She went on to establish a trust for the family.This book discusses science, both the present state of medicine while Henrietta was being treated for cervical cancer (nothing short of radium tube inserts and lead!) and how science has grown in its understandings and treatments because of her cells. The book has to address the ways African Americans have been treated badly by the American medical establishment from Tuskagee to forced sterilizations, to even some patients injected with Henrietta's cells without their knowledge! I felt like I knew much of the story already, but only because this book has received so much acclaim and press, and I find rightly so. I'm not a scientist but felt I could understand it as Skloot presented the information.I also learned some terrifying things that don't soothe my paranoia. Huge government stores of cells that no longer belong to you - not owning the rights to your bodily tissue - still all true in the 21st century. Ever wonder where your blood, teeth, etc. got to? Ha. I read this during Banned Books Week 2015 because earlier this year it was challenged by a Tennessee mother who felt it was ""pornographic."" The woman had cervical cancer, cancer of the CERVIX, a body part all women have. Oh please. This book isn't pornography, it's science. Discussed on Episode 042 of the Reading Envy Podcast."

It couldn't decide if it was a history of the cells, the life story of one woman, a chronicle of how an author tracks down the life story of a woman, a position paper on racism, a position paper on human tissue ownership, or a position paper on disorganized rhetoric. I think it was all of those, and it drove me absolutely up the wall.As a history of the HeLa cells ... I read a Wired article that was better.As the life story of Henrietta Lacks ... it read like a list of facts instead of a human interest piece. And it kept going on tangents (with the life stories of each of her children, her doctors, etc.)As the story of the author tracking down a story ... that was actually kind of interesting.As a position paper on racism...it had a lot of disturbing stories - but no cohesive point.As a position paper on human tissue ownership... the best chapter was the last one, which actually listed facts and laws. And while the author clearly had an opinion in that chapter -it was more focused and less full of unrelated stories intended to pull on your hearts strings and shift your opinion.As a position paper on disorganized rhetoric...it was a stellar exemplar."
692,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"I don't know how many copies of a book need to be sold before it can be fairly described as a best-seller. In any case what kind of bearing does the number of copies sold have on the amount that a book is read? The success of Rebecca Skloot's book is maybe entirely unsurprising as it covers a wide range of angles and caters for many tastes. It has something of the ever popular misery mémoire, some social history, an investigative aspect with detective road trips, along with an exploration of one of the wonders of modern science. All of this comes together in two alternating narrative strands, the death of Henrietta Lacks from cancer and the strange ongoing life and use of a tissue sample collected from her that has been used for a host of purposes from cancer research to gene mapping to assessing human sensitivity to commercial products, as well as the impact of her life and death on her young family. As a whole it was a moving reading experience.The story told is a very simple one, and I found how it is told completely effective. It is not surprising that some forms of cancer, even with treatment, are fatal. It is not surprising that poor black people in the USA remain poor over time, it is not surprising that difficult childhood experiences can overshadow later adult lives, it is even not surprising that something if not entirely free to obtain like the tissue sample in question, has come to be a source of profit for many companies while providing no benefit to either the donor’s family nor the institution which provided Henrietta Lacks with medical treatment and collected the sample in the first place. Perhaps part of the success of Skloot's narration is just how unsurprising those elements of the story are juxtaposed with the completely unexpected survival and continuing life of Henrietta Lacks' tissue sample. There is a recognisable slice of life married with something unique so far in science and of enduring scientific impact.For me the most serious downside is that I had the feeling that Skloot had hoped her book might start a public debate on issues of sample ownership, but so far that discussion so far has not escaped the courts. That leaves us with a great piece of non-fiction writing rather than a rallying cry for change."
693,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,5,"In reading non-fiction, and particularly scientific non-fiction, my two most frequent gripes are: a lack of personal story, and a lack of overall narrative. It's my opinion that just because a work isn't fiction, it shouldn't miss out on the use of structural elements more common to fiction: a strong narrative and narrative structure can improve any kind of communication.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a near-flawless implementation of this. The book has three components: the story of Henrietta and her family, the story of the science made possible by Henrietta, and the story of the author, Skloot, researching the book. I can't stress enough how effectively these three threads are woven together, making a educational, intersectional, and ultimately tragic story. If you are interested in the human side of scientific advance then this is an absolute, absolute must-read. Highly recommended."

As always, I enjoyed the close-up views of racial issues.I'm glad that the author wrote this book, as I'm sure it helped Henrietta's family understand what really took place all those years ago.

695,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5036644-meredith-o-donnell,2,"Interesting concept. Reading it with my book club... Upate: Finished. I am always up for a rousing ethical debate. The deplorable breach of privacy, a basic human right, displayed in the book was appalling. Anyone who has ever been dehumanized can relate to the way Henrietta was objectified for the sake of science. It was beyond unconscionable. I am glad the story was told. I hope that Skloot's efforts will remind the industry of science and medicine that they need to be held accountable for their actions, and the finished product is not the only thing that matters, but the methods taken on their road to discovery count as well. Henrietta's cells have provided mankind with a lot to be grateful for, and for that we must thank the scientists and doctors who worked feverishly and masterfully, experimenting and coming up with new ideas. However, the people behind the cells have rights too. Bioethics have come a long way since the 1950's, but there are still flaws.  I learned in several journalism courses I took in college that the job of the journalist is to hold accountable those who serve the public--be it in politics, consumerism, or medicine. That is what Skloot has done by tackling the story of Henrietta Lacks--the person behind the immortal HeLa cell line. For that, I commend her. While I agreed with the endeavor, I had a few issues with her strategy. As others have mentioned, she placed herself in the story excessively. She claimed it was necessary, but I doubt if it was necessary to the extent that she did it. She seemed to want to constantly remind the reader of her plight. This is not the place of a journalist--just tell the story, don't tell your own story of getting the story. Also, she had an incredibly obvious bias, and a suspiciously not-so-obvious agenda. I did question Skloot's intentions. She spoke as an advocate for the Lacks family, but I do wonder whether or not she was a welcomed one, or a useful one.  She classifies the book as nonfiction upfront. And that it is. Or was intended to be... the story is real. But the details were so convoluted, shrouded and murky that it became difficult to truly believe with any authority one thing or the other. For instance, Skloot admits that the medical field was not proficient in recording things during this time (no computer.) Consequently, a lot of important details concerning Henrietta's illness, diagnosis, the retrieval of her cells, her death, her autopsy, her burial, among other factors, were not clearly documented. Also, Skloot's main sources of information were the Lacks family--a family frought with incest, disease, mental illness, partial deafness, drug abuse, a lack of intelligence and a lack of education--none of which was their fault, but all of which made them unreliable sources of information. For instance-- did Henrietta ever meet Gey? His assistant Mary swears yes. But Dave Lacks says absolutely not. The tie breaker is dead..and was on her death bed/twisted with pain/heavily medicated during the time of the alleged meeting so it is not out of the realm of possibilities that she either forgot about the encounter or didn't think to bring it up. It's also just as possible that Mary was confused (no documentation,) or was lying. I have no reason to believe one over the other. Also, Joe's murder. Skloot decided to present the family's convenient recollection of events authoritatively--that it was self defense. However, a witness testified under oath that the fatal attack was unprovoked. Again, I have no incentive to take one side over the other, but Skloot's selective storytelling contributed to my distrust of her as a narrator, a writer and a reporter.  When I read a nonfiction piece, I prefer for the facts to be indisputable. Aside from credibility issues, I also questioned Skloot's true motives. She hid behind an ultra-liberal facade: a sympathetic crusader who was empowering this poor, uneducated family with the voice they never had. But notice how she proudly boasts of a deep friendship with Deborah Lacks in the beginning of the book... but I wonder if Deborah, God rest her soul, would confirm this claim. We'll never know. Skloot seemed to pester the family, while at the same time condemning those who did the same...as if her reasons were more pure and justifiable. She also clearly lamented their lack of medical coverage and financial compensation, and a portion of the proceeds for the book will go to a scholarship fund for the family, but why didn't she just write them a big check? They didn't benefit directly. If you read closely, Skloot reveals that she had to agree to certain conditions before the Lacks family would agree to talk to her. She had to tell the family's story exactly the way it was told to her, whether facts were verified or not. She was so desperate to satisfy, what started out as her own morbid curiosity, and grew into an obsessive mission, that she agreed to this stipulation. That almost concealed little tidbit, combined with the unreliability and untrustworthiness of the medical profession during that time, left this reader skeptical of nearly every word. However, the subject matter and her insistance to reinstate the human side to a research subject, as well as the fact that Skloot manages to make very technical terminology and notions perfectly clear to a former B student in Biology, earn the writer one star each. I recommend reading along side Oliver Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat-- another nonfiction piece about the humanization of patients. Meredith O'Donnell"
696,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is fascinating and heartbreaking in equal measure. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Before she died, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in cultures for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory. Those cells, known as HeLa, are still alive today and have advanced medicine and science in countless ways; it seems there's no end to the list of discoveries made because of HeLa.I've tried to imagine how [Henrietta would] feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. Henrietta's cells helped launch the fledgling field of virology. As the Cold War escalated, some scientists exposed Henrietta's cells to massive doses of radiation to study how nuclear bombs destroyed cells and find ways to reverse that damage. Others put them in special centrifuges that spun so fast the pressure inside was more than 100,000 times that of gravity, to see what happened to human cells under the extreme conditions of deep-sea diving or spaceflight. The author took great care to learn about Henrietta Lacks. She paints Henrietta as a woman who accepted her illness and faced her treatment with unparalleled resilience and strength. One afternoon, as Henrietta lay on the couch, she lifted her shirt to show Margaret and Sadie what the treatments had done to her. Sadie gasped: The skin from Henrietta's breasts to her pelvis was charred a deep black from the radiation. The rest of her body was its normal shade -- more the color of fawn than coal. ""Hennie,"" she whispered, ""they burn you black as tar."" Henrietta just nodded and said, ""Lord, it just feels like that blackness be spreadin all inside me."" Cancer is a foul creature, sinister and terrifying, but Henrietta's cancer was a force of evil from the nadir of Hell. It ravaged her body in unmerciful ways; it's no wonder those cells survived in a test tube where all other cells died. Suddenly [Henrietta's] body went rigid as a board. She screamed as the nurse ran to the bed, tightening the straps around Henrietta's arms and legs to keep her from thrashing onto the floor as she'd done many times before. Gladys thrust the pillow from her lap into Henrietta's mouth, to keep her from biting her tongue as she convulsed in pain. The book is extensive; all of the information is efficiently organized and comprehensive. Part of what makes this book so tantalizing are all of the near-misses, all of the moments when the author was turned down in her quest to learn the truth about Henrietta Lacks. Had she given up, as so many others did, Henrietta Lacks might have been forgotten and this riveting book would have never existed. "
697,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6942006-suzy,5,"I was completely in the thrall of author Rebecca Skloot while listening to the audio of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. This is at once a scientific story of Henrietta's cancer cells, called HeLa, which were harvested from her as she was dying from cervical cancer in 1951. These are the first human cells to become ""immortal"", perpetuating themselves even to today, and being used in many important health discoveries including polio vaccines, in vitro fertilization, aids research, cancer drugs and too many others to mention. It is also the story of Henrietta and her family, who had no idea that their mother's cells were taken or the importance of the cells to medicine. Her children learn about this from Skloot's research and this knowledge causes misunderstandings and various reactions in Henrietta's adult children from some wanting financial remuneration to others just wanting their mother to be honored and respected for her contribution to science. My heart went out to Henrietta and her family who, because they were poor and black, were treated, and lived, as second class citizens. They are often at the mercy of their many health problems through lack of education, lack of access to health insurance and suspicions about the medical establishment. It seems so unjust! (Thanks to GR friend Will Byrnes for posting this NY Times article on the consent agreement reached with the family finally . . . 62 years later. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/sci...)At first I found the structure of the book a little frustrating because it jumped in both time and storyline, but once I decided to just flow with it, I was completely engaged. I think listening helped. It was as if the author was telling her story just to me, and that I was discovering it side-by-side with her. There are so many layers, that my thought is there's something to connect to for everyone based on a reader's interests coming to the book. Skloot reveals early in the book that she learned about HeLa in a biology class when she was younger and decided then and there to research and write about them. Little did she know that she would be telling the story of the Lacks family right along with the scientific importance of the cells. I appreciated the interview at the end of the audio where Skloot tells us how she decided on the focus and the structure of the book. This was the February book club pick at our wonderful art museum here in Minneapolis, and I enjoyed the discussion. I'm eagerly anticipating the HBO movie based on the book which will be aired April 22 here in the States. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5686132/"

The fact that her family can't even get reliable health insurance really just adds insult to injury. This is a well-researched, well-written book. The issue it discusses is extremely important, and the last chapter about tissue ownership is outright terrifying. It was the first time I heard of ""gene patents"" (what?), and this:Myriad Genetics, which holds the patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes responsible for most cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, charges $3,000 to test for the genes. Myriad has been accused of creating a monopoly, since no one else can offer the test, and researchers can’t develop cheaper tests or new therapies without getting permission from Myriad and paying steep licensing fees. Scientists who’ve gone ahead with research involving the breast-cancer genes without Myriad’s permission have found themselves on the receiving end of cease-and-desist letters and threats of litigation.I don't know what to say. I think this paragraph sums it up very well:
The debate over the commercialization of human biological materials always comes back to one fundamental point: like it or not, we live in a market-driven society, and science is part of that market. Baruch Blumberg, the Nobel Prize-winning researcher who used Ted Slavin’s antibodies for hepatitis B research, told me, “Whether you think the commercialization of medical research is good or bad depends on how into capitalism you are.” On the whole, Blumberg said, commercialization is good; how else would we get the drugs and diagnostic tests we need? Still, he sees a downside. “I think it’s fair to say it’s interfered with science,” he said. “It’s changed the spirit.” Now there are patents and proprietary information where there once was free information flow. “Researchers have become entrepreneurs. That’s boomed our economy and created incentives to do research. But it’s also brought problems, like secrecy and arguments over who owns what.”

If it doesn't win every non-fiction award for 2010 than whoever votes for non-fiction awards should have their library cards taken away from them*.The author, Rebecca Skloot, does a masterful job of seamlessly weaving in the scientific story of Henrietta Lacks' immortal cells and the effect they have had on medicine and medical ethics with a real human interest story about Henrietta and the struggles of her family. Skloot does this without coming across as maudlin, preachy, overly technical, guilt ridden, condescending, or just plain boring. She deftly weaves two legs of one story together, darting in and out with ease and keeping the reader interested in learning the science and caring about the people. She does this all while doing her best to avoid passing judgment or creating villains. Like a good journalist, she simply reports the facts of a fantastically and seemingly thoroughly researched book and lets the reader interpret them as they will.In all, this is not only a terrific science book that is not afraid to tackle gray areas of ethics and leave them unanswered without getting preachy, not only a gripping human interest story with more than one human we are interested in, but also a socioeconomic look at the educational opportunities and struggles of poor, disadvantaged people across several generations of our country. Most of all though, this is a uniquely American story.*Seeing as how Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World by Liaquat Ahamed won the last Pulitzer for history, perhaps voters should have already had their library cards taken from them because that book was so bad I wouldn't even use it as a doorstop and besmirch the dignity of my door."

All the while, her children and family had no idea that this was happening, and they struggle to come to terms with what it means to have immortal cells, while the family can barely afford medical treatment.Rebecca Skloot takes a nearly impossible task of researching something that was breaking at the time, and challenges human rights to our own tissue and most importantly how client consent has changed over the past couple of decades.

During this time period, research physicians, or physicians who were interetsed in biomedical research were striving to culture an immortal cell line, which has enormous applications and implications in biomedical research. The physicians, with the help of other scientists and technicians, were able to create a cell line that had greatly sought-after conditions for the purposes of biomedical research, inlcuding immortalization and ease of growth in culture. The use of her cells greatly impacted the field of biomedical research, and the cultivation and use of the HeLA cell line contributed to the establishment of the first Polio vaccine, cancer research, and countless other types of research where the characteristics of the HeLa cell line offer great advatange and resource for pusuit of scientific knowledge. My review of this book has nothing to do with the contributions her cells have made to the scientific community. The physicians at the time did take her cells and culture them without her consent, but that was standard protocol at the time, and she was not isolated for that purpose. We have all contributed from the use of her cells, therefore, it is hypocritical to be critical of the use of them.Despite a major attempt to create a ""boogey-man"" portrait of the physicians/scientists that worked with her cells, none of them were awarded financially for establishing the HeLa cell line. The author tries to create an image of a poor black woman who was robbed of her cells without consent and not awarded the enormous monentary prize for their use, but the truth is, this was standard procedure at that time period,and her cells just happened to actually work for that purpose. I was very interested to learn more about Mrs. Lacks in this book. What made this book impossible to read was the author. She hardly writes more than a few pages about Mrs. Lacks. She mostly wrote a biography detailing her attempts at finding information, without providing anything insightful about the actual woman it was supposed to be about, Mrs. Lacks. Most of the book is about her relatives and their immense anger and resentment about not being compensated for the use of Mrs. Lacks' cells. I don't really give a shit about that. A lot of shitty things happen to people in this world, this wasn't in any way the worst, and that would have made a decent book if that was what the book was supposed to be about. This book was so boring, I didn't even finish it. "
707,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"This book has been around for a while now, so most people know the basis. Rebecca Skloot tells the story here of Henrietta Lacks, the poor black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1951. Why do we care about Henrietta Lacks? Quite simply, her cells, which were taken without her knowledge or consent, became known as HeLa cells. Now does it sound familiar? HeLa cells have been around for a while, recognizable to many for their importance in developing the polio vaccine and gene mapping. HeLa cells have survived and grown since 1951.But Skloot recognized there was more to the science than just the letters HeLa. She set out to uncover the truth about the person behind the abbreviation. With the help of members of Lacks's family, Skloot spent about a decade on this book. She visited the now-defunct Clover, where Lacks grew up, she took Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, to the hospital where her sister, Elsie, was put away as an ""imbecile"" and where she died under suspicious circumstances. Deborah, who was four when Henrietta died, was just as committed to finding out the full story about her family as Skloot was.The book bounces around in time, from the 40s and 50s as Skloot detailed Henrietta's life and illness, to ""present day"" of 2009 when the book was published. Skloot's own journey with her research began in the late 90s. She got married and divorced during the writing of this book. She knew Henrietta Lacks was unknown by the public, even though her cells had been such a vital part of medicine and science for decades.The heartbreaking part about this real-life story is that Henrietta's descendants and family knew nothing about the HeLa cells themselves. They were never given any real explanation about the cells, nor were they compensated in any way. The book brings to light a lot of issues, from social to ethical. Most impressive is the concept that all tissue in and on your body belongs to you while it's attached to you, but as soon as it's removed from you, it's not longer ""yours"". You have no rights over it. It can be researched and sold and re-sold and modified and studies. You get no say in whether you want studies on pieces of your body to go towards the cure for cancer or for the creation of atomic bombs or other devices of mass destruction.Years ago I had a cyst removed. Thinking of a Margaret Atwood story, I asked my surgeon (and every subsequent tech and anesthesiologist whom I met prior to surgery) if I could keep my cyst once they excised it. After their initial responses of ""Ew, WHY?"" they told me that would not, could not, should not ever be available to me. ""But it's MINE"" I tried to argue. They claimed liability, and disease (not that I had a disease, but it's jut not sanitary). None of them had read the Atwood story I was referencing, but if they had, they would have been even more adamant that I should be allowed nowhere near the cyst once it had been removed.I've thought about the same thing during a breast biopsy and then more recently, when they removed my thyroid. What are they going to do with it? What I really would like, more than being able to keep these things that have been pulled from my body over the years, is frequent updates about the road my tissues have traveled. Remember in the 90s the popularity of things like adopting a star, or a whale, or a polar bear. You'd get a picture in the mail for the low-cost of whatever, and then a few updates throughout the year about where your whale is and how it is faring.That's what I want with the tissues that have been taken from me. Just a postcard with a picture of what they're doing with my tissues, a little update that says ""ElPa cell was just sold to Norway for the price of 8 million where they will study the effects of cigarette smoking on this tissue taken from your breast in the early 2000s!""As Skloot spent more time with the Lacks family, she became almost a member of the family herself. After the initial periods of suspicion and caution, Skloot was embraced and was called for all the important family births and deaths and other major life experiences. From a personal storytelling point of view, I found that touching, though it wasn't exactly a necessary part of the main story.I suppose really it means that HeLa (Henrietta Lacks) is a part of everyone, brings us all together. She continues to live, and while her family will never see any portion of the proceeds and still have no say over their mother's cells, there's some satisfaction that can be derived from how common the name Henrietta Lacks is now. The woman behind the cells should never be forgotten. Her contributions (that she didn't even know she was making) should be told. She was more than just the abbreviations HeLa.I know everyone has read this book already by this point, but it came up in my little world because I'm now on the Common Reader Committee at the university where I work. At the first meeting, it became obvious that very few of us are actually readers (one went so far as to say he doesn't like to read, which begs the question as to why he was even there). This book was one of my recommendations, even though I hadn't read it yet. My boss read the first six chapters and felt that it would cover a lot of the bases that our university likes to cover, and would appeal to the three main colleges very well by dealing with social justice issues, science and medicine, legality, ethics, and health and wellness.Now that I've read this book on my own I can go back to our meeting next week and say, holy shit guys, this book really does cover ALL the bases. The idea is this would be a book that everyone could read - every student, staff, and faculty member. While the story meanders a bit and gets a bit dry in other places, I think ultimately the story of Henrietta Lacks and her cells will appeal to all readers in the university.But if I hear one more time from anyone ""But are they mature enough for it"" I will scream. College students aren't quite as dumb as everyone likes to think they are. Maybe they're lazy, but cheese and rice, I'm not going to dumb down the Common Reader in concerns that students won't be able to read a book anymore.Plus there's an HBO movie coming out next month based on this book, so if just reading a book isn't incentive enough, maybe Oprah will be.(My other top contenders would be The Handmaid's Tale and March: Book One. Though some on the committee thinks if we give a graphic novel to college students they will think we're giving them ""cartoons"" to read and there may be an uprising. It's fascinating to me how little faculty and staff know the students at their own university. To be fair, those who suggest an uprising are also the ones who don't read, and they claim not to know how to read a graphic novel. Someone asked ""Do you start at the front or the back?"" conflating graphic novels with manga, I believe. This committee will be a long road for me. Someone just put me in charge already.)"
708,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,5,"It reads like good crime fiction. It chronicles the life of the woman whose cancerous tissue became the first tissue in history which could be successfully grown as culture and used in various, and countless, experiments from vaccine research to cloning. Her tissue was so successful in fact that it became virtually immortal, surviving in various environments and proliferating at prodigious rates. Yet, very little was known about the woman herself, her life, her family, her history, and this is what Skloot set out to uncover. What she found out is absolutely stunning from the point of medical ethics, American history and American healthcare. Fascinating. Highly recommended."

710,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27544898-bookishrealm,5,"This book was phenomenal in more ways than one. I knew a little bit about Henrietta Lacks, but I was definitely not aware of the extent to which her family was affected by the use of her sells in modern day biology. It broke my heart to see how her family, deeply rooted in religious beliefs, was broken because they felt as though Henrietta's soul resided in those cells. I have my own personal opinions about the entire concept of doctors taking medical waste for their own advantages. Nevertheless, what I can say about this issue is that it is stories such as the Tuskegee Experiment and the use of Henrietta's cells that have ultimately made the black community hesitant about wanting to go to doctors. I plan to do more research on this topic and it may be a project that I throw myself into. Hopefully I can find more text that really delves into the black community's experience with the medical field. This really opened my eyes to a lot of issues related to the medical field/industry and I can't wait to read more. "

I like a book that makes me think, just as I did when I was a college student. There's a fine line between what is ethically/morally ""right"" and that which infringes on a person's own being and that person's (or family of said person) rights to his/her cells. There are never any correct answers or final conclusions in the world of bioethics...it's an ongoing dispute but one that really caused me to question my own decisions and how they are interpreted."
712,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is required reading for pharmaceutical students at a nearby Oklahoma University where a friend of my daughter goes to college. She told me about this book over Christmas. I can see why it’s required reading. I’m glad it is and I hope it is for medical and research students everywhere.It tells the story of an African American woman, Henrietta Lacks, who went to Johns Hopkins in 1951 for treatment for cervical cancer. Some cancerous cells were removed from her body. This much she knew. The cells were also saved, cultured, and reproduced—without her knowledge or consent—as was common practice at the time. What makes this an amazing story is that Henrietta’s cells have never died from that day until the present, hence the title. They continue to grow and reproduce at a phenomenal rate. They currently exist in laboratories, hospitals and warehouses all over the world; have been used in almost every form of scientific research from the 50’s until now; have gone to space; have been contaminated and caused contamination. The scientific and medical communities owe untold debt to the cells it calls HeLa and yet not one dime of compensation, even in terms of discounted medical care or health insurance has ever been received by any of Henrietta’s numerous descendants. Interestingly enough, they aren’t looking for anything in that way. Now isn’t that refreshing? Rather, in spite of all they have suffered—and indeed this is a book about pain—their focal interest throughout was in finding out what happened to their mother since she died so young, gaining recognition for her and learning what happened to Henrietta’s oldest daughter who died in a ‘hospital for the negro insane’, which was 1950’s terminology.  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks crosses many disciplines and for that reason I expect scientists might skim the vignettes about Henrietta’s children, while those who prefer human interest could find themselves avoiding the technical sections. Virginia Woolf’s Common Readers, however, will positively adore this book! It has everything they look for in the written word. Not only what was just mentioned, but also: the complexities and importance of the ‘tissue issue’, what are the medical, legal, ethical, and other parameters for tissue gathering, storage, research, usage, and compensation. And I commend the author, Rebecca Skloot, a self-proclaimed non-believer for her sensitive handling of the many stressed and stressful events, issues and personalities she encountered concerning matters of faith, morals, and religion.  A very important book to read!  Here is a rather long but fascinating 1998 BBC documentary about Henrietta Lacks and HeLa.  Here is an article which gives some more current info about the Lacks family and the issue of privacy v. tissue donation. "
713,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"Henrietta Lacks, a young African-American mother of five children, died in Baltimore in 1951 from a highly aggressive form of cervical cancer—but more than fifty years after her death, part of her lives on in the form of HeLa, a cell line cultivated from a tissue sample of hers which played a key role in several major scientific and medical breakthroughs. Skloot's book tells Lacks' story, partly to pay tribute to a woman who was forgotten by all but her family for many years despite her importance to medicine; partly in order to examine the complex attendant issues of medical ethics, race and class. Skloot's writing is fluid and accessible, and I learned some things which were shocking though not surprising to me (see the organ retention scandal which broke in Ireland a few years ago). That said, I would have liked for a stronger focus on the ethics and the science aspect of the novel and less on the lives of Lacks' children and other relatives. Skloot's focus on them and on some of the more unpalatable aspects of their lives felt quite voyeuristic to me at points, recounted not because Skloot wanted to examine the effects of the vicious cycle of poverty on people's lives but because it would inject more drama into the book. The author talks at length about the less-than-pure motivations of those who had previously profited from Lacks' cells, and their refusal to compensate Lacks' family in any way, about how she was financing her research with credit cards and student loans—and yet her end-goal was always to acquire a book deal, and her account of her relentless attempts to get in touch with members of the Lacks family made me highly uncomfortable. Much of the latter half of the book dealt with the relationship between Skloot and Deborah, Henrietta Lacks' youngest daughter—again, uncomfortable to read about at several points, and not especially relevant to the book's main thrust. Overall, an interesting read, but I feel that The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks could easily have been edited down to half its length—and focused more on Henrietta because of it."
714,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/925949-jude,5,"it's as if the writer wanted the story the way i would want it, and self-observes the arc of her own education the way i would, so the emotional style resonated at a profound level: a combination of passion, humility & fearlessness that makes me trust the her completely, that makes me grateful she is the person who chose this story - or that it chose her.& then there's the story - the science. the race & class issues, the muck of medical ethics before patients were real people and blackfolk were real patients... that's the warp. The weft is the story of a friendship between two women meeting each other on the edge of both their worlds, brought there by Henrietta: her immortality is not simply a series of cells.the narrators are excellent. the pacing is a tiny bit slow, but that works for the direct quotes - and hearing voices in dialect anchors the story in time and place. The voices in this story - the amount of quoted text & speech- keep this story very immediate - with the feel of a good documentary or good fiction.a joy."
715,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3214537-sequoia-m,2,"I had heard so much about this book and was so excited to read it . . . but there's not much to read. I tell you the premise, and that's the book. It just keeps doubling over itself to tell you the same science, the same sad story of the people it affected, and nothing ever really happens. People say things like ""hold on, are you ready for this?"" and then nothing happens. It's the same information over and over. So I'm going to spoil the whole book for you; Henrietta Lacks was a poor syphilitic black woman who married her cousin, had a bunch of kids, and died very young of an aggressive cancer, the cells of which doctors took samples of without asking and then developed into the first 'immortal' cell line, which went on to be used by scientist and doctors around the world. Her descendants are plagued by poverty and bad health. That's it. Now imagine me telling you different versions of that over and over while I also tell you about how I'm researching and writing about it, dealing with this difficult and suspicious relatives. That's the book. "

Henrietta Lacks was a poor black women who cells were taken without her consent and used by many scientists to develop vaccines,cloning, and many more things. Unfortunately her family was very poor and never received any money from her cells being used.They had many health problems and could not afford health insurance and died young as a result. I learned a lot of interesting facts while reading this book. "

718,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"Its a very important story, its unique in its format of that the cells of Henrietta lacks are doing and how it seems that even today nobody understand why or how those cells are even still alive, BUT sadly the actual story of doctors doing something without permission is NOT a unique one, since sadly there are still today patients being used without their knowledge -as it is even stated in the book itself. And i think that especially that is something that should be taking away from this book: This story is important and interesting, but so far not much has changed in the medical field so that this type of thing does not continues to happen without permission from the patients themselves. This book does point out quiet a lot of positive things that happened because and with cells and how it could have never happened without them. Some horrendous things, some wonderful things where achieved thanks to those cells and with that thanks to Henrietta Lacks. And i am defiantly one of the first people to point out that medical advances are necessary and that we still have way to little knowledge and actual solutions for way to man illnesses! But i think that this book also points out two very important things and drives them home quiet nicely: 1. Human tissue was once part of a person!We all should respect that. Yes its important that a lot of different science fields have access to tissue samples. But its also important to remember the people that gave those samples. Be it willingly, unwillingly, during life or after their death, it was once part of a living breathing person! I think a lot of us prefer to ignore that, or try to forget it and i think that is defiantly one thing we all should work on always remembering when we take any kind of medicine without a second thought! 2. there are lot of loopholes legally that should be worked on!All this talk of ""technically it wasn't required"" in this book just made me want to shake someone! What it comes down to in very basic forms -especially in regards of this specific book and the story it tells- is that everyone should be asking for permission. Doctors and scientists should explain in understandable terms what they want and why it could be helpful and i am pretty sure that a lot of people -especially those with illnesses!- will be more than willing to hand out tissue samples for further use! No need to just take them without asking! So why do it?Which brings it all back to the first point: lets not forget all those ""samples"" actually come from someone that is not just there to be a lab-rat!Now the one ""negative"" thing of this book is that i personally didn't really like how the Skloot wrote this book. Some sections felt as if she wanted to get that particular part of the story told and done with as fast as possible and shoved a lot of details and information into a pretty small section and number of pages. And than sometimes she would go on and on about some things for endless number of pages that i personally felt that it wasn't necessary to go on about it for that long. To say it short it is not he best nonfiction writing i have read. BUT its also far from the worst. Its very readable and yes it could have been kept a little shorter, but all in all it was done pretty well in the writing department. of course that is completely personal and some of the reviews i read LOVED the writing, so clearly that part is debatable.If you are interested in this book, defiantly give it a try. If you are going into a scientific field? Defiantly read this!"
719,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,"A book like this makes me realize how important education in general and particularly science education is. Today’s science is yesterday’s magic—for those who don’t understand science, it can seem like very frightening black magic. The story of Henrietta Lacks explores the intersection between science, research, education, capitalism, civil rights, and consent.The major question implicit in this book is whether we have any claim to our own cells after they have been removed from our bodies. Is it ethical to take “discarded” cells—those left over after medical procedures—and do research from them and potentially make money from either the cells or the research. This issue gets us down somewhere in our irrational subconscious—after all, we all “know” enough about voodoo and black magic to know that curses require hair, nail clippings, blood, or other bodily secretions in order to be effective. In many ways, the story of the HeLa cell line traces the history of medical research in the US (and to some extent, other countries), evolving from the exploitation of vulnerable people towards the concept of informed consent. It also traces the history of an African American family, liberated from slavery, but not from poverty and deprivation. The current distrust of science has some real roots in situations like these, where people were used without their knowledge for experimental purposes. But the lack of scientific literacy in the general population helps with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and the prevalence of medical quackery. Witness all the “miracle cures” that people buy into. One older lady that I used to work with was always pouring money into some miracle weight loss scheme or another—it didn’t seem to occur to her that if the method actually worked, it would be front page news on Time magazine, not some obscure ad in the back of a newspaper.We have to seriously question ourselves and our politicians about the quality of our educational systems. Are they being funded? Do we have enough teachers? Can poor children hope to get education equal to that of rich children?As my grandfather used to say, no education is wasted."
720,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"For a non-fiction book about science, this book is pretty interesting. Chapters about genes, cloning and cancer are juxtaposed with chapters about Henrietta's personal life and about the author's interactions with the Lacks family. I think this book would scare a lot of people about how privacy is dealt with as a legal issue in the medical community. The book is about Henrietta Lacks - a woman whose cells live on and on to be experimented with, cloned, put into space, blown up, used to make human-animal and human-plant hybrids, etc. The point of the book is that these cells were taken from her without her knowledge or consent. Today, no one in her family can afford medical care, even though their mother/grandmother's cells are stored by the billions in laboratories around the world. This brings up many interesting points in debates about what rights the medical community has to do procedures 'for the benefit of humankind' vs. the rights of the individual and patient. Do your cells and tissues belong to you? Do they still belong to you, even when removed from your body? It is surprising how fuzzy the laws still are on this issue. The book also touches a little bit on racism - Henrietta was black, and the doctors who took and distributed her cells were white. But racism isn't the main focus. I found this book fascinating - and cell research isn't really my forte. I recommend this book, even to people who generally don't read or like non-fiction."
721,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,5,I read this book back in 2013 just before I joined Goodreads. I found my review on Audible and decided to add it to Goodreads for my records.This is a well written non-fiction book that provides back ground information about unfair treatment of minorities by medical research. Cassandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin did a great job with the narration of the book. The story of Henrietta Lacks and her family is interesting and the discovery and care of the Hi La cells. One major item about the family is the lack of education that played a major role in their understanding and ability to control the situation. The book accomplishes its goal of promoting proper documentation of biological tissue research. It raises the question of ownership of our own tissues and whether or not we have proprietary rights to our bodies in situ or in vitro. This question needs to be answered NOW not in the future. The other teaching of the book was how important education is to each individual. This is an absolute must read book for everyone on this planet.

724,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"I blew through this fascinating audiobook, practically manufacturing housework to do so that I'd have an excuse to plug myself in (okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration; there was plenty of housework to do without my having to manufacture any). I would recommend this book to just about anyone seeking a great read -- even if you're usually more of a fiction person, this non-fiction book offers plenty of interesting characters and storylines as well as being informative and provocative in the way of non-fiction.Did you know that much of medical research (and the benefits we derive every day, including many routine vaccines and medications we take for granted) is dependent on a culture of human cells that continue to live and reproduce even after their original owner died in 1951? Well, I didn't. And I wouldn't have thought that this factoid would interest me particularly, not being much of a science person myself. But somehow, Rebecca Skloot was able to make the dynamics surrounding these cells not only comprehensible to me but intriguing (no small feat). Even more intriguing, though, was the story of the late human being behind these cells, Henrietta Lacks, who never knew that her cells had been taken for research. Henrietta's surviving children, tragically losing their mother at a young age to cervical cancer and raised in a poor and abusive environment, only learned about this later in life and never saw a penny of the proceeds.""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" contains several stories. There is the story of Henrietta, a poor young African American woman with incurable cervical cancer, and of her children struggling to grow up without her after her early death. There is the story of the doctor who decided to slice off pieces of her tumor just prior to her death without asking or even informing her, who then discovered that these cancerous cells were immortal. There is the story of the cells, which began to be mass-produced and distributed to researchers for a wide variety of interesting and often ground-breaking experiments. And there is the story of Rebecca Skloot, a journalist who was persistent and dogged in her efforts to win Henrietta's family's reluctant trust (after they had been duped by others attempting to capitalize on Henrietta) so that she could learn and tell their story.Henrietta's adult children in this book are colorful characters with their own stories who overcame some difficult situations, some more successfully than others. We also meet different doctors and researchers -- while some prove to be profiteers, others are truly dedicated to science for its own sake. The doctor who originally took Henrietta's tumor for research without her knowledge fell into the latter category, which is part of what makes this a three-dimensional book rather than a simplistic polemic. A product of his times, this 1950s doctor was less sensitive to the medical and research ethics which have since received more attention, particularly when it came to a poor African-American woman. Should you care if someone uses your body tissues for medical research without your consent? Before I began reading this book, my thought was, why the heck would I care? Assuming that these tissues need to be removed in any case, why not use them to do some good for science and for mankind? But Rebecca offers some anecdotes which complicate this question, and the irony running throughout the book is that Henrietta's descendants cannot afford decent medical care, even as the entire medical profession benefits from Henrietta's unwittingly donated cells.Even if you think you're not a science person, even if you think you're not a non-fiction person, I would recommend checking this book out."
725,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"On the threshold between medicine and ethics.This book talks about ethical and legal conflicts, historically raised by the discovery of immortal cells that changed medicine and patients life's for the better. It‘s an astonishing story you probably didn‘t hear about before:In 1951 a colored poor woman named Henrietta Lacks walked into the Hopkins University, where a doctor extracted cells from her large cervix tumor, that killed her briefly after. But as they discovered in the laboratory, those were anything but normal cells, but the first immortal human cells grown in culture. They are still alive today and were replicated to millions and spread to laboratories all over the world, though Lacks has been dead for more than sixty years. They called them HeLa cells and they were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. What interested me the most was the scientific and legal part of that book. Ultimately it‘s a question of property and if we have the right on our cells, once they leave our body, particularly if we don‘t know about it.First there is the problem with uninformed consent. Henrietta did not provide informed consent for her cells to be used, she didn‘t have knowledge. Beyond that people were later unknowingly injected with her tumor cells, for the purpose of medical research. The same was performed on healthy prisoners with their knowledge, though their free consent seems to be questionable. They developed tumors, sometimes killing them. Furthermore her autopsy report was later published in the book of a journalist, the family didn‘t knew about and didn‘t want to see published. The question is the violation of privacy rights.The second problem are genetic rights/non-rights. Her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later, and didn‘t fully approve of it‘s usage A big focus also are patents and profits for biologic material.Henrietta and her family were very poor and didn’t even have health insurance. They received zero profits, while her cells sell for multiple-millions until today.Very shocking are also racism claims. Because the cells were discovered in the 50, making public that white people were treated with cell stems of a black woman would have had a major impact. Additionally implications are made, that colored people were categorically abused, abducted, purposely infected and killed to perform medical experiments. The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications, but actual, valuable people and historic events.What I didn’t like just as much though, is how the story is told at times, jumping between characters and writing styles; sometimes loosing the silver lining. The writing is very simple and doesn’t at all feel factual. As a non fiction fan, I miss that at times but I guess that others appreciate it even more. It reads a lot like a novel, particularly since a lot of content is told through conversations. In conclusion a super interesting story I won’t forget quickly!"

It describes the life of Henrietta Lacks and her family, the origin of the HeLa cell line (the first human immortal cell line), the research conducted with these cells, and also the author’s research and interviews in unfolding this story.“I’ve tried to imagine how she’d feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. I’m pretty sure that she—like most of us—would be shocked to hear that there are trillions more of her cells growing in laboratories now than there ever were in her body.” "

This book can satisfy several audiences on several different levels. The technical information about the science of cells is fascinating. The ethical questions raised by the unauthorized use of someone's cells are important to ask and ponder. But most fascinating is the story of the Lacks family. Skloot's exhaustive research spanned a decade and she tells a story that is honest, heart wrenching and provocative. "
728,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl,5,"This is one stellar piece of nonfiction that has a bit of everything in it for everybody. Beautifully written and structured because it is clear that while there's SOoo much information here, it is arranged in such a way that you don't get lost. Sure the author is a science writer, but she's also a creative nonfiction writer so the book doesn't read like a nonfiction textbook, and has the plot structure of fiction. Some chapters tell the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family, others take you on the research journey with Rebecca Skloot. The interactions she has with the family makes for light, sometimes humorous reading. In fact, the chronology is done in a way to make the book more interesting. The book is as much about family, as it is about science, history, racial tensions, and of one extraordinary black woman who has done more for medical research and advancements, than anything or anyone the industry has seen. It will have you crying, laughing, yelling at people...you name it. Born in 1920, Henrietta Lacks was thirty years old when she went to see a doctor for ""spotting"" and pain, and started getting treatments for cervical cancer (mind you, in the ""colored"" wards of John Hopkins. This was during the Jim Crow era). The researcher/doctor who treated her, collected samples of her cells (without her knowledge) while he placed radium inside of her. She soon deteriorated and each time she went in for treatment, her cells were taken and stored. Yet she knew nothing of the cells growing in a lab, or the fact that she was now infertile because of her cancer treatment. When she died, her husband signed paperwork to have an autopsy performed, because he was under the impression that doctors would find out if his children were predisposed to whatever his wife had, not knowing that his signature allowed his wife's body to be cut open to help with more research.This is the breadth of the story I think. A story about an African-American woman whose life and death seemed to be an irony--she wasn't allowed to mention her white, slave-owning family, yet she was buried next to them. She wasn't allowed to use the ""white-only"" medical facilities, yet her cells were mixed with white cells. In science cell culture, there were no other cells with the ability to multiply and stay immortal like hers. So every major medical breakthrough, like polio vaccine for example, came from the usage of her cells. The main thrust is, she didn't know. Her family didn't know, and they didn't find out until twenty years later because the name Henrietta Lacks was hidden by the doctors who used her cells as research. Scientists made millions from her body and her family had tons of health issues, with no help from their mother's cells and no health insurance. ""A search of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database turns up more than seventeen thousand patents involving HeLa Cells,"" Skloot wrote. But Henrietta's son Lawrence wanted to know, ""She's the most important woman in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""There they were, at a time when the country was learning about the ""Tuskegee Syphilis Study"" (where African-American men with syphilis were recruited for research, then made to die slow, painful deaths even after their researchers realized that penicillin would cure them), and cells from a black woman was being used to save millions of Americans, mostly white.In this book, Skloot brings the woman behind the cells to life, talks about her life, her troubled marriage, her children. She develops a relationship with Deborah, Henrietta's daughter who suffered the most from all of it. She talks to scientists and researchers. She brings in history. She talks about race tensions and shows how when slavery was abolished, African-Americans became slaves to another master: medicine. I'll admit, at times it was an emotional roller coaster for me, but one quote from Deborah stood out for me and should for you:""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different.""So anybody should be able to read this book because the way in which it is written, is not to point fingers (not even at the medical industry because the author manages to explain those times as well) but to glean the truth. To finally give credit where credit is due, and to educate. To honor a woman, a mother, a wife, whose body makes it possible for us to get some of the modern medical treatments that we get today. This is one book I will remember, that's for sure! "
729,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon,4,"In 1951, Henrietta Lacks passed away due to complications arising from cervical cancer. Following her death, cancerous cells were harvested from her body and used in ongoing experiments regarding the growth of cells outside the human body. Previous to Henrietta, scientists could only make it a few days before the cells would ultimately die, forcing them to start all over. Henrietta’s cells were different, they grew at an astounding rate and researchers were able to keep them alive. Since the discovery, they've been used in countless experiments and led to numerous scientific breakthroughs - most notably the polio vaccine.Today, Henrietta’s cells usually go for a few hundred dollars a vial but her descendants live in poverty. While many of her children believe they should be compensated for the sale of HeLa cells, court cases involving similar claims have always found in favor of research companies rather than individuals - the argument being that once a procedure is performed and tissue is removed from a body, it is no longer of use to the individual and the hospital can do with it as it pleases, be it incineration or study. On one hand, it makes sense given that it was highly doubtful Henrietta’s husband could have opened a cellular research facility, however, the problem lies within the fact that researchers did not tell Henrietta’s family about the importance of HeLa cells and lied to her children when additional bloodwork was requested for further study.The story of the Lacks family is a heartbreaking one. Henrietta had a terrible upbringing and following her death, things became that much worse for her children. While the book mainly concentrates on the HeLa cells, there’s a shocking piece on her daughter Elsie, who had been diagnosed with “idiocy” and institutionalized at Crownsville Hospital Centre (a.k.a. The Hospital for the Negro Insane) following her mother’s death. The conditions at the time of Elsie’s arrival were deplorable. They had a total of eight attendants (four in the day, four in the evening) for five hundred and sixty patients. One ward in particular had seventy eight patients with only twenty eight beds. There were also only three toilets to share amongst them all. You can imagine how much this upset the family when they found out decades later.While The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks can be deeply upsetting, it is without a doubt an important book. Author Rebecca Skloot spent years interviewing the Lacks family (which at times was certainly no easy task) and researching Henrietta’s life and death, all information that had been buried over time. The story flows well and her afterword provides greater insight into the legal ramifications of future soft tissue research. Henrietta’s youngest daughter Deborah always wanted the world to know about the person behind the HeLa cells, the real human being who provided the ammunition for several medical discoveries. Thanks to Rebecca’s tireless work, Henrietta Lacks' incredible true story is out there for the world to see.Also posted @ Every Read Thing."

Some people comment on the human interest aspect of the story with regard to the Lacks family. Other people mention the cell science. For me, the most interesting thing was the history of informed consent, or the ""Lacks"" thereof. (Go ahead and laugh now at my clever wordplay. You know you want to.)It's hard to believe the bizarre ways people's bodies were used for medical research, with or without their consent. Even when they did give consent, they did so without being told exactly what would be done to their bodies. Too often the people used for the studies were the poor, the uneducated, and prison inmates. Back in the forties and fifties, ""Many scientists believed that since patients were treated for free in the public wards, it was fair to use them as research subjects as a form of payment."" YIKES! That's not just unethical, it's abominable.Rebecca Skloot's dedication to the research and writing of this story is remarkable. She spent pretty much the entire decade of her twenties in pursuit of the truth about Henrietta Lacks and her ""immortal"" cells. My only reason for not awarding the full five stars is that I thought the book could have used one more ruthless edit before final printing. "

Clearly, a result of hard work and intense research and, above all the fact that the author has taken student loans and used her credit cards for the research work and had no other backing or support.

736,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66292681-sarah-lumos,4,"  “Henrietta’s (cells) were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.”  Argh, I feel embarrassed admitting this, but before reading this book, I had no idea what the HeLa cells were. I never studied science in-depth, which is now one of my biggest regrets. However, I guess in some ways I was lucky: I got to know who Henrietta Lacks was before meeting her famous cells. In this well-researched biography, Rebecca Skloot tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, a poor Black woman who was only 31 when she died from cervical cancer. While she was getting treatments at John Hopkins Hospital, Dr. George Guy took cells from Lack’s tumor without her consent. After examining her cells, Guy felt amazed. He realized her cells were unlike any he had seen - Henrietta’s cells refused to die.HeLa would become the first immortal cell line grown in a lab. For scientists, this discovery was monumental. It would allow them to conduct experiments they never could before. Henrietta’s cells would later help create in vitro fertilization, polio vaccines, and cancer treatments. Although HeLa cells have affected each of us in different ways, before this book’s publication, most of us had little to no idea who Henrietta Lacks was.Here is what I found riveting: Henrietta never graduated from high school, yet she became one of the most important people in science. Sure, science has its own explanation for how this happened, but her family believed God chose Henrietta. God wanted her to come back to Earth in the form of her cells to help others. Since the Lacks had a weak science background, faith was their way of understanding what happened to Henrietta, and making sense of the non-sensical. Though most of the Lacks were happy Henrietta’s cells were advancing science, some of them were mad. The Lacks had no science education, and scientists never bothered to explain to them what happened to Henrietta in a simple way. Researchers exploited their ignorance and the Lacks were never able to give informed consent. Their frustrations are understandable. I felt like giving each of them a hug when I read these passages. If I were them, I would be upset too. While HeLa cells were becoming a multi-million dollar industry, the Lacks were living in poverty, barely able to afford health insurance:   “...the last thing he remembered before falling into unconsciousness under anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened to medicine. Sonny woke up more than $125,000 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery.”  I also admire Skloot's grit because this was a massive project to undertake. I can understand why this book took her a decade to write. I think she wanted to do Henrietta's story justice, and she did. Skloot made sure the world knew about the Lacks and what they did for science. Furthermore, I liked that Skloot’s discussed the social determinants of health. Her clear prose helped me better understand patient rights, inequalities in medicine, informed consent, and tissue ownership laws. Overall, “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" was a magnificent treat. I am positive other readers will find this book as informative and awe-inspiring as I did."
737,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Skloot delivers a mix of science history and human interest in her journalistic style. She discusses medical ethics particularly the issue of informed consent as she tells the story of Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta was a poor black woman who joined the great migration of the 1940’s moving from rural southern Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. She was treated for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins, the only nearby hospital that would admit blacks in 1951. After suffering through the then standard radium therapy, she died that same year. Samples of her tumor were removed and became the first successful human cell culture to sustain itself. Known as HeLa her cells live on today in labs around the world the subject of endless experimentation. Most of the book is spent on Henrietta’s life, her daughter Deborah, their families and extended relations as well as the author’s work with the family to research the book. We follow Henrietta from her childhood in the 1920’s growing up in former slave quarters on the wrong side of the tracks in the small tobacco country town of Clover, Virginia. Skloot gives a somewhat romanticized version of what must have been a harsh life of poverty and discrimination. Similarly Skloot tries to bring out the positives while dutifully reporting the difficult lives of Henrietta’s descendants who suffer from chronic mental and physical illnesses, limited education and continued discrimination in the Baltimore area. Particularly interesting to me was the communication gap between the scientists and Henrietta’s working class African American family. A big part of the problem was the history of exploitation of African Americans by white doctors and their medical institutions. This history had been internalized into a pervasive distrust of doctors and hospitals by Henrietta’s family. Henrietta’s and her family’s fear is understandable and it struck me as part of a broader issue. With unarmed black men dying regularly at the hands of the police, we see similar fears by African Americans today. Skloot points out that scientific progress was made from practices that now would be clearly unethical. Henrietta’s cells sped up the development of the Polio vaccine in the early 1950’s saving many from this devastating disease. Concepts such as informed consent did not exist in 1951. Even today the issue is very murky which the author addresses in her afterword. At the end of the book Skloot returns to Clover to find it gone. All the ramshackle old buildings torn down, just empty fields remaining. Most of those who knew Henrietta had now passed on too. Only her cells remain, thriving in labs everywhere and generating the ground breaking medical discoveries of a new era. "
738,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2528841-claire,5,"In the same way we sometimes debate whether the story should be seen as an entirely seperate entity to the writer, so too do scientists perceive a sample of cell tissue as seperate to the human body it was extracted from. Except that it is not possible to extract a story from a writer's imagination without their consent. Henrietta Lacks was a young mother in her early thirties when she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer that would quickly take her life. She was fortunate to live close to the John Hopkins hospital, set up to ensure equal access to medical care for all' no matter their race, status, income or any other characteristic that might have otherwise given cause to discriminate.Before undergoing treatment, one of the Doctors took a tissue sample of her healthy cells and the cancerous cells, as he had been doing to most patients, in an effort to try and find cells that would continue to replicate without dying - the elusive ""immortal"" cell. It had never been done successfully with human cells before.He succeeded and the cells became known the world over as he gave them away freely, known as HeLa cells, the immortal human cells that never died and could be used over and over again to test for cures to disease and to observe how cells react to numerous variables, furthering science in ways unimaginable previously. Few paused to ask who the woman behind these cells was, what was her story, how did her family feel about this multi million dollar research industry that was making great strides in science yes, and also making entrepreneurial types wealthy in the process.Rebecca Skloot made Henrietta the subject of her research for 10 years in the creation of this thorough, respectful account of the life of Henrietta Lacks and her journey to uncover the events of the time within the context of what was the norm in her day. In much of it she is accompanied by Henriettas daughter Deborah, a passionate woman who was unable to find peace in her own life, until she had helped bring her mother's story to light.A brilliant and informative story and piece of scientific medical history that reads like a novel and brings our awareness to the many who unknowingly make sacrifices for the better of others and that always present aspect of those hovering in the wings, recognising an opportunity to profit."

The votes have been in for years: author Rebecca Skloot’s book racked up 19 significant awards and citations in 2010 when it was first published. The 2011 trade paperback edition I read boasts five pages of exuberant blurbs before you even get to the title page. I wanted to be a curmudgeon about it, but the story is so serious that I had to relinquish my pissy attitude. It is just that type of story: a sensational true crime story with ramifications in the fields of health and science; race and sociology; ethics, history, and journalism. Suspenseful, cinematic, and factual, Ms. Skloot manages to pack it all inside of 310 pages, with 71 pages remaining for appendices, acknowledgements, notes, and discussion group questions! She writes knowledgeably, intelligently, compassionately, and skillfully. This book is all that! The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family. It is about the miraculous and immortal cells---taken from her cervix without her permission in 1951 and how they have been serving medical research ever since. It is a story about her daughter, Deborah, and a science journalist (Rebecca Skloot) dedicating years of her life to questioning, investigating, researching, and writing. It is about injustice and justice; human liberties, and privileging science over human life and the right to make informed decisions. This book chillingly illustrates the complex path of ethics and medical research in the United States from the 1950s to the present. It made me mad, but it also educated me in a profound way."

In fact this is the first book to keep me so intellectually and emotionally engaged in a very long time. I struggle to find the words to express what it meant to read about the plight of this woman and the medical knowledge gained from her cells. To read this book is to begin to understand the impact of these cells on modern medicine. Then the book takes you further to read about what has happened to her family during these medical breakthroughs, the impact of what happened and its influences on the laws and the practice of medicine. Just an amazing book with so many elements intertwined and presented with such empathy and beauty. As a brief aside, shortly after I finished the book I had a minor medical procedure performed. Before they would begin, the patient must sign a medical release form and on the form was a statement asking the patient to relinquish all rights of ownership to any tissue samples removed. After reading this book I understand the implications (signed it, but was much more aware of the rationale behind it). This was a life affecting book for me. I didn't close the book thinking that I knew the answers to the ethical questions it raised. What I did feel was that it just seemed some how unjust that her family fared so poorly when her cells were so vital to so many of the scientific advancements made after her death. It presented legal and ethical quandaries that some of the finest legal minds still haven't wrapped their minds around. Engaging and enlightening book? And how!! Highly recommended!!!"

As someone who is strongly considering donating my body to science when I die, this was a probative read to think about the changing ethics of medicine, and a reminder that so much scientific development has been done on unwilling, non-consenting, and uninformed individuals. Top among these unwitting contributors, must rank Henrietta Lacks, whose indomitable cancer cells have led to inestimable developments. Though the ethics have tissue collection has drastically changed since the 1950s, it is surprising how much of a wild, wild west this area remains.

“Everybody in the world got her cells, only thing we got of our mother is just them medical records and her Bible.”
In 1951 doctors at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore diagnosed an unusually extreme case of cervical cancer. The breakneck growth rate and resistance to common remedies were unlike anything previously seen. Without informed consent, the doctor scraped a clump of cells from the cancerous tumor during one of the 30 year-old woman’s visits and deposited them with a nearby cell culture lab operated by George Gey. There, in the air-controlled space of Gey’s facility, something happened that researchers had long suspected out of reach. Where countless other cells before them had died, hers survived, and multiplied indefinitely. The immortality of this one cell line would prove instrumental in treating a number of the world’s most heavy-hitting diseases and set the stage for an all new era in cell research, medical diagnosis, drug development and bioethics. But this is a story not just about bundles of cells, but about the humanity behind them, and in particular the family to which they will forever be tied.That woman was Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta passed away just nine months after diagnosis, but it would be more than two decades before her family received word of the namesake cell line which survived her—HeLa. Its value as a scientific and commercial commodity was paramount, getting bogged down in the thicket of rights and privacy less so. Once researchers discovered that Henrietta’s cells did not die but instead bred a new generation every twenty-four hours, HeLa quickly became the tireless workhorse of the culture community. Vials were trucked to research facilities around the world, where they were regularly exposed to a pavilion of infectious diseases, merged with non-human DNA, and even shot into space in an effort to study the influence of zero gravity.Over time, details about the parent of the eponymous cells funneled out of view. Henrietta’s own kin were oblivious to the fact that her cells lived, were being studied and tested in dozens of countries, and were being exchanged at great profit. Once the unwitting donor’s official name was released, journalists descended in full fervor, leading to a lifetime of turmoil and unrest for the Lacks household. Set against the rich legacy of the family’s cells, their life of poverty and unpaid medical bills seemed untoward by comparison, and this sense of injustice only mounted as more details filtered in from the press.Rebecca Skloot’s segue into this lush narrative was by and large a product of serendipitous circumstance, having first heard of HeLa in an intro to biology course at her local community college. After learning that these cells had lived outside their host's body for the better part of a century, and about the remarkable advances they have gifted to science, Skloot shot up her hand and innocently asked, ""Who was she?"" The professor's reply proved unsatisfying: ""An African American woman."" The seed of curiosity had been planted. By the time Skloot graduated she'd decided to write a book to recover the disremembered woman whose cells had won so many victories for science and society.Who Was Henrietta Lacks?For more than a decade, Skloot layered herself into the Lacks’ story, befriending and forming deep bonds with Henrietta’s children and cousinry. She forges an especially strong connection with Deborah Lacks, Henrietta’s youngest daughter, who was unfortunately too young to remember much about her mother. With a mix of patience and persistence the two work together to dig up Henrietta’s heritage and bring to light her hitherto uncelebrated legacy. It is Skloot’s at times unstable relationship and camaraderie with Deborah that gives the narrative its steam, as the two probe ever deeper into the mystery surrounding her mother.Tracing the family’s roots places Henrietta’s childhood at the tail end of the Jim Crow era, a time when segregation meant a great deal more than which bathroom and water fountain one was required to use. Rampant legal disadvantages in the South bred systemic, institutionalized maladjustment for blacks, and this included limited access to medical care. Having spent her youth on a slave plantation in Clover, Virginia, Henrietta joined in the Great Migration at the ripened age of twenty-one, exchanging her familiarity with tobacco fields for a new life in Baltimore. Nine years later, she would be diagnosed with the malignancy that led to her iconic cell line. And it would be another fifty years before Deborah, with the help of Skloot, laid eyes on her mother’s original medical records.Johns Hopkins Hospital was founded for the express purpose of treating Baltimore's poor and, unlike today, informed consent upon providing blood or tissue samples was neither required by law nor common practice (the term did not even appear in a court document until 1957). Like everyone at the time, Henrietta hadn't a clue about what would become of her excised genetic material and the boons it would lavish upon the scientific community. This became a flashpoint issue in the years that followed as the occasional patient attempted to turn a gray area into a lucrative venture. While we learned more about DNA and transmissible disease, Henrietta's resilient cells inaugurated an international conversation on the commercialization of biological materials and where exactly the donors fit within that ecosystem. In many ways, the conversation is ongoing. (Skloot includes a superb summary in the afterword which draws together the various threads of this nuanced debate.) The HeLa LegacyTo properly gauge the vastitude of the legacy tied up in Henrietta’s cells, it’s important to understand 20th century cell culture. Until Henrietta came along, cell immortality was a pipe dream. While standard, non-cancerous cells had been grown in vitro since 1907, none of them survived long enough to endure important testing, petering out after 50 divisions, on average. Even cancer cells, like those common to cervical cancers, died shortly after relocation to the culture environment. This meant not only was there a brief window for experimentation but that a continuous supply of fresh cells was needed to sustain research. Many in the field yearned for a better way.HeLa keynoted a paradigm shift. They were robust enough to survive in the bricolage of materials used in Dr. Gey’s culture medium, and they were susceptible to the same range of infectious diseases as were normal cells. This allowed researchers to inject the lively DNA with diseases as well as cures. Not merely a boon to science, this revolutionized the field, so much so that one of the researchers Skloot interviews in the book, when asked what would happen if HeLa was pulled from research use, replied, “Restricting HeLa cell use would be disastrous. The impact that would have on science is inconceivable.” (p. 328)Thanks to Dr. Gey’s partnering efforts with labs around the globe, the benefits of HeLa manifested seemingly overnight. In just one year after HeLa’s genesis, Jonas Salk and his team were able to derive a vaccine for polio by infecting HeLa cells, followed shortly by drug treatments for HPV, herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia and Parkinson’s disease. In 1953 HeLa became the first cells to be cloned successfully. In total, some 60,000 papers have been published on HeLa, and cell culturists still use her cancer cells as a model for human biology.What was it exactly that gave HeLa cells their added dose of moxie? Even today, we can only speculate. We now know that Henrietta was infected with both HPV and syphilis, so one theory is that this virulent combination may have helped suppress PCD. A rival theory suggests she had highly atypical genes to begin with, perhaps a rare mutation, that enabled the cancer to spiral in unspecified directions. We still are uncertain. HeLa has also been the source of much frustration over the years from regularly contaminating other cell lines, often halting research until the botch-up is sorted.Closing ThoughtsRebecca Skloot’s ten-year effort is a literary and cultural marvel balanced between unsheathing the posthumous success and humanity behind one of the richest narratives in science and laying bare the bioethical implications to which it is attached. It succeeds on both fronts. Skloot is at her most animating when channeling the lens of Deborah Lacks as they band together to reach some much-needed closure to the saga thrust upon the Lacks family. With her first book, Skloot has demonstrated in equal measure her facility for conveying scientific nuance while weaving meaning and poetic force into a cohesive whole. Yes, this is first and foremost a work of nonfiction, but its pages are emblazoned with enough touches of novel-like charisma to beckon both crowds. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a timeless story delivered by a gifted writer and the definitive presentation of the legacy Henrietta never lived to see. Highly recommended.Skloot also founded The Henrietta Lacks Foundation - click here for more - to provide support for the Lacks as well as assistance to African Americans pursuing education in science and medicine. A portion of her book’s proceeds are donated to the Foundation.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."

Her cells contributed to many of modern medicines discoveries, including the polio vaccine and gene mapping, and yet her family is still so poor they cannot afford health care hacing seen none of the money generated by these cells.This book explores the debate about what makes up a person's body. Is a shed skin cell the property of the person whose DNA is within the cell, or have they given up their ownership? And what exactly constitutes informed consent?I thought it was a fascinating read, and while it appealed to my Science background by explaining the advances made, and the complications that arose, it also brought to light the bittersweet story of the family that thought they had lost their mother, and never knew that a little piece of her still existed until years after her death.A powerful read I'd recommend to everyone."
746,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101060033-woman-reading,4,"In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (ILHL), Skloot blends the Lacks' family history with that of medical sciences and all against a backdrop of systemic racism. For decades, her cell line, named HeLa, has far eclipsed the woman of their origin. Henrietta Lacks was born in 1920 as the ninth child of Eliza and Johnny Pleasant in Roanoke, Virginia. When Eliza died after birthing her tenth child in 1924, the family was divided amongst the larger network of relatives who pitched in to raise the children. Henrietta and David Lacks, her first cousin and future spouse, were raised together by their grandfather Tommy in a former slaves quarter cabin in Lacks Town (Clover), Virginia. Lacks Town had been the inheritance carved out of Henrietta's white great grandfather Albert Lacks' tobacco plantation in the late 1800s.From Skloot's interviews with relatives, Henrietta was a generously hospitable, hard working, and loving mother whose premature death led to enormous consequences for her children. Henrietta suspected a health problem a year before her fifth and last child was born. She went to Johns Hopkins, a renowned medical institution and a charity hospital, in Baltimore and received a diagnosis of cervical cancer in January 1951. (view spoiler)[Since cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, it seems likely that she had contracted the virus from her husband, who had not been monogamous. (hide spoiler)]During her first treatment for cancer, malignant cells were removed - without Henrietta's knowledge - and cultivated in a lab environment by Johns Hopkins researchers attempting to uncover cancer's secrets. Although the brachytherapy with radium was initially deemed a success, Henrietta's brown skin turned black as the cancer aggressively metastasized. After several weeks of great pain, Henrietta died in October 1951.ILHL raises questions about the extent to which we own our bodies, informed consent, and ethics surrounding the research of anything human. The HeLa line was a rare scientific success as those malignant cells thrived in lab conditions and eventually became crucial to thousands of research projects. Skloot reported that in 2009, an average human body was worth anywhere from $10,000 to $150,000. In the case of John Moore who had leukemia, his cell line was valued in millions of dollars. To prevent human trafficking, it is illegal to sell human organs and tissues, but they can be donated while processing fees are assessed.As a charity hospital in the 1950s, segregated patient wards in Johns Hopkins were filled with African Americans whose tissue samples were regarded by researchers as ""payment."" One cannot ""donate"" what one doesn't know. The Lacks family discovered HeLa's existence 22 years after Henrietta died. They've struggled to pay their medical costs while biotechnology companies have reaped profits from cultivating and selling HeLa cells. In 1999, the Rand Corporation estimated that 307 million tissue samples from  178 million  people (almost 60 percent of the population) were stored in the US for research purposes. Although the US is nowhere close to definitively addressing the questions raised by ILHL , a little progress has been made. In 1974, the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects (the ""Common Rule"") required informed consent for federally funded research. The Common Rule was passed in response to egregious and inhumane experiments such as the Tuskegee Syphilis project and another scientist who wanted to know whether injecting people with HeLa would give them cancer. Note that this rule exempts privately funded research. In 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) made it illegal for health practitioners and insurers to make one's medical information public without their consent. This was after researchers had published medical information about the Lacks family. It should be evident that human tissues have long been monetized. One method of creating monopoly - like control has been to obtain a patent. As of 2005, the US has issued patents for about 20 percent of all known human genes. Myriad Genetics patented two genes - BRCA1 and BRCA2 - indicative of breast and ovarian cancer. In 2009 the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), on behalf of scientists, sued Myriad Genetics. In 2013, the US Supreme Court gave the victory to the ACLU and invalidated the patents, thus lowering future research costs and obliquely taking a step toward defining ownership of the human body."

After the birth of her son, she only grew sicker. At John Hopkins, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer and underwent treatment. Unfortunately, the cancer spread quickly and Henrietta died. Before her death, a sample of her cancerous tissue was taken and cultivated in the lab. Her cells grew at an unprecedated rate and became extremely valuable to the scientific realm. Called HeLa, Henrietta's cells were the first to reach ""immortality"". Her family did not know this information for several years. This is the story of the woman behind the cells.I began reading more non-fiction books last year and have since come across some amazing works. 'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' will join those ranks. Hands down, this is one of the best non-fiction books written. Broad-in-scope, thought-provocking, awe-inspiring and jaw-dropping, this book is the perfect marriage between science and human interest. Greatly researched and with much heart, the prose is magnificent. Henrietta Lacks was a poor tobacco farmer, descended from slaves. When she was diagnosed with cervical cancer, she did not particularly stand out but when her cancerous tissue was cultivated in the Hopkins lab, that was a different story. Until HeLa, scientists had not been able to produce a cell line that perdured. With HeLa cells, however, they hit the jackpot. Used in everything from the development of vaccines to genetic research and even to test out the effects of a nuclear bomb, the impact of these cells is immesurable. Just one problem, Henrietta did not give consent to give her cells and her family did not learn of just how important Henrietta was until many years after her death. About 50 miillion metric tons of HeLa cells have been produced to date, more than enough cells to populate a village full of Henriettas. While Henritta never travelled far form her home, her cells have been all over the world and even into outer space. They have been infected with several illnesses and combined with other cells. Odds are eah of us has, in some way, come in contact with HeLa.The way in which Skloot balances the science aspect with the human asprct of the book is done with finnesse. The HeLa cells are something impressive but more so is the woman behind them. Henrietta was strong, confident and resourceful. By all accounts, she faced her cancer diagnosis with sheer bravery and never stopped thinking about her family, even when she knew she would not survive. Its truly sad that for that Henriettas's cells did for the world, her heirs do not even know where the exact location of her grave is. What stood out for me most was the relationship that developed between Sloot and Deborah (Henrietta's daughter). Until Skloot, most were merely interested in the cells with Henrietta as an afterthought. I love that Skloot focused on Henrietta. Its time she gets the recognition that is way overdue.This work raises many questions. With the ""Tissue Issue"", consent and scientific progress are at a standstill. Henrietta's cells were taken without her knowledge or that of her family. The exact amount of money made off the HeLa cells is not known but its exorbitant. Her family never saw a cent and sadly struggle to pay their health insurance. Biological ownership is a tricky subject matter. The John Moore case was one of the cases that put it on the map and it has been a hot botton issue since. While there are some basic rules to follow, the gist is that once any tissue is ""abandoned"" at a hospital, it ceases to be property of the patient. Blood tests, biopsies and tissue taken from surgeries are property of the hospital and they have no obligation to let their patients know if and for what their tissues can be used. The scientific communty argues that to seek consent would lead to a decreased access to materials or have people seek financial gain. Personally, I find this troubling. The moral and ethical concerns are overwhelming and getting to an agreement between both parties is a battle. Scientific progress is important but at what cost? This is a book that will stay with me for a while. Its up there with 'The Radium Girls' (another great non-fiction work). Highly recommended!"
748,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher,2,"2.5 stars. I found the 1st 1/2 of this book fascinating and eagerly awaited to hear more of Henrietta's story. Henrietta was someone you couldn't help but root for and you were amazed to hear of her strength and perpetual optimism. The 2nd 1/2 of this book was tedious and annoying. The book started to drag and focus too much on the researcher's hardships, but mostly, I found Henrietta's family to be utterly unlikable. I kept thinking of that saying, ""I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you"". I felt much of the Lacks family, particularly Deborah and Joe (who changed his name to the long Z name), enjoyed being miserable. Despite being corrected again and again on their misbeliefs, they would resort right back to harboring on their anger/hatred/anxiousness over falsities. I felt their actions reflected a disregard for much of the advancements that came about from their mother's indirect contribution to medicine, but focused instead on a victim mentality and desire for monetary contribution - monetary contribution for something they had absolutely nothing to do with and had not worked for one iota.  As for the ethics surrounding Henrietta's cells being taken, be it right or wrong, she was not treated any differently than rich white patients were at that time when it came to taking cells/tissue without informed consent. In that sense, I don't think she was personally wronged in an intentional manner, though I think it's crazy what could be done without informed consent at that time. If you want to talk about who was wronged in an intentional manner, we'll talk about Elsie. Furthermore, I'm not completely convinced that some things were not explained to Henrietta regarding sampling cells. It was stated by Henrietta and the Lacks family time and again that they often came away with a poor understanding after speaking with MDs, yet they did not ask further questions or state their lack of understanding. Therefore, anytime it was exclaimed they were told ""nothing"", I had doubts. Henrietta's cells as they were taken, were of very little worth. It was the ingenuity of the people that used them that gave them their worth. Should Henrietta have received a modest compensation? Perhaps, it's muddled for me. Organ donors do not receive compensation (or their families). The reward is knowing you have saved other's lives. Should her children be entitled to compensation decades later for advancements that continue to be made 50 years after the cells were taken - cells that were not even from their own body? Definitely not. Is her family entitled to give permission for what can and cannot be done to Henrietta's cells? Absolutely not. Informed consent (which was not legally required at that time) is between the patient and the MD - what other family members wish is insignificant. The most interesting part of this story for me was easily Henrietta's story. Her childhood, the abuse of the time to the poor and minorities, the overt racist culture, and her strong optimistic nature that she maintained despite the world burning around her. The part that made the story a chore to finish was the ignorance that the family clung to despite being informed of truths, and the smallness with which they appreciated the lives that have been saved due to the awful cancer their mother acquired compared to the greatness with which they felt they deserved money as a result of research and ingenuity that they had never participated in, let alone understood. Azle - 7/16"
