Carol Anne Freeling was certainly right when she said, “They’re hee-ur,” well maybe not enraged spirits, but there are certainly plenty of entities present to which we have paid insufficient attention. Maybe Regan MacNeil was closer to the mark in proclaiming “We are legion.” 
 When Orson Welles said “We’re born alone, we live alone, we die alone,” he was mistaken. Even when we are alone, we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis—a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. Some animals are colonized by microbes while they are still unfertilized eggs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then proceed through our lives in their presence. When we eat, so do they. When we travel, they come along. When we die, they consume us. Every one of us is a zoo in our own right—a colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collection. An entire world. 
Trying to map what it is to be a physical human being, in something like the  Human Genome Project, is a daunting task. But our genes tell only part of our story, like a novel with a beginning and ending but no middle. That middle is taken up by the vast array of other life that exists within our bodies. While the guests we harbor may not necessarily be in league with Satan, they are a mixed lot. They mean us no harm, particularly, and we have evolved very workable symbiotic relationships with them, but they are not necessarily our friends either. They took up residence for their own benefit and will stick around and provide benefits to us only as long as we provide what they need, like that girl/boy friend you remember with gritted teeth.I won’t say this book will blow your mind, but this is your brainAnd it’s not even Mardi Gras – from the Brain Association of MississippiThis is your brain after reading this bookShame about that haircut[In the interest of full disclosure, it should be known that every day when my wife was reading this book, she would walk in the door and tell me of yet another thing she had read that had totally blown her mind. Not that my mind didn't go Ka-Boom when I read it. It certainly it. But hers was blown first. I only steal from the best. ]I Contain Multitudes will change how you understand not only the human body, but all the biota on the planet, hell, the universe. It will help you understand how it can happen that diseases like the flu can adapt so quickly to our latest attempts to stamp them out. It will help you understand why coral reefs are dying. It will give you some new words that help keep the new knowledge manageable. (My favorite is dysbiosis which is what it sounds like, a biological parallel to dystopia, with a hint of enforced disorganization.) It will expand your appreciation for how microbial biology works within people and in the world. It will offer you hope that there can be a future in which many of our maladies will not only be diagnosable, but will be treatable with the introduction of the right, specific probiotic. It will do your dishes and massage your feet. Well, ok, not the last two, but KABOOM, big new look-at-the-world stuff. Ok, you biologist types, pre-med, med, post med, anti-med, wearers of white lab coats, whatever the length, you know this stuff, at least I hope you do. But for most of the rest of us it is indeed a big change, a new layer of reality, well maybe not entirely new, but new enough to go KABOOM!Our intro to the world of which Yong writes, antibiotics, is probably akin to the one WW II bombadiers had through their bombsites. Amazing invention/discovery, antibiotics. They do a great job of wiping out pathogens, the nasties that make us ill, well, some of them anyway. Other harmful microbial types, the viral ones, roll their eyes at incoming antibiotics and keep on with what they are up to. However, as with items dropped from passing aircraft, the use of antibiotics entails considerable collateral damage, as the human body is a container for a vast array of microbial life. One might well envision millions of non-pathogenic residents shaking their fists as the incomings not only wipe out the harmful bugs, but vast numbers of the helpful ones as well. Ed Yong offers a more on-the-ground look, filling us in on what is actually going on inside, and how this part of what’s inside relates to that other part.If these folks can have an entire civilization inside a locker, just imagine what might develop in your liver or large intestine.If you don’t know who Ed Yong is, it’s a good bet that you will before too long. Yong is a popular science guy, a Neal DeGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Mary Roach, Jacques Cousteau, David Attenborough, Carl Sagan sort, a person who can take the wild, wonderful and fascinating things that are going on in the world of science and distill them all down for public consumption without making viewers’ or readers’ eyes glaze over, or listeners’ ears suddenly clog, without making you feel like an ill-educated dolt, and he accomplishes this with enough humor to produce a fair number of smiles and an occasional LOL. (Not in Mary Roach’s league for humor, but hey, who is?) He is an award-winning science writer at The Atlantic, whose work has appeared in a wide range of publications, from The New York Times to Nature, from The Guardian to Wired, from Slate to Scientific American, and on and on. He splits his time between London and DC, and I would not be at all surprised if he dashes back and forth in a TARDIS. I have provided links in EXTRA STUFF that will lead you down rabbit holes of fun material from Yong that may take you a while to leave.Ed Yong - From SpeakerpediaAmong the many surprises you will encounter here are a squid with its own high-beams, the microbial advantage of vaginal birth, the impact of gut microbes on mood, why a third of human milk is set aside for our guests (protection payments?), the relationship between the US Navy and mucus, why no man may be an island, but we may be archipelagos, and vats more. There is serious consideration given to how our relationships with this invisible world evolved:
…animals emerged in a world that had already been teeming with microbes for billions of years. They were the rulers of the planet long before we arrived. And when we did arrive, of course we evolved ways of interacting with the microbes around us. It would be absurd not to, like moving into a new city wearing a blindfold, earplugs, and a muzzle. Besides, microbes weren’t just unavoidable: they were useful. They fed the pioneering animals. Their presence also provided valuable cues to areas rich in nutrients, to temperatures conducive to life, or flat surfaces upon which to settle. By sensing these cues, pioneering animals gained valuable information about the world around them…hints of those ancient interactions still abound today.
 “It all depends.” As if life wasn’t complicated enough. Don’t you just love it when you are looking for help and the person you are asking responds with “It all depends.” And it really does, and it really will. What will be different, though, will be that your caregiver will have a much better idea than most caregivers can possibly have today. They will be able to look at a profile from a type of blood test and match potential solutions to the bacteria living in your gut, or wherever else in your two-legged bacteria condo might pertain. This knowledge is still in its infancy – at least a broad knowledge, but it is coming, and has the potential to make meaningful improvements in our health.
As microbiologist Patrice Cani told me, “The future will be a la carte.”And in this a la carte future, we won’t have to stop at picking the right bacteria for the job. Some scientists are picking the right genes for the job, and combining them into artisanal bacteria. Rather than just recruiting species with the right abilities, they are tinkering with the microbes themselves to endow them with new skills. 
Balance – from Explainxkcd.comThis raises some concerns, although they do not get a lot of attention here. If scientists can develop designer probiota to ameliorate suffering, there will always be evil-doers eager to use new technology to make designer biota intended to act as pathogens. In fact that is pretty much my sole gripe about this book. I wish more space had been devoted to the potential dangers of this advancing treatment modality. Just ask yourself, What would ISIS do?The title of Ed Yong’s book may not be up there with The Selfish Gene, Silent Spring, or Guns, Germs and Steel but what it lacks in snappy-ness it more than makes up for in content. This is a smart, readable explanation of one of the major ongoing scientific revolutions of our time. If you look deep inside yourself you will know that this is absolutely must-read material.

1,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"I feel like this book really exemplifies what I want from a science book written for a mass audience. It made everything really accessible and easy to understand without sacrificing on providing details or explanations. It provides a lot of citations so I can go look up the specific research papers and experiments mentioned that are of most interest to me, which I did. It also just connected research to larger ideas and theories for why things work the way they do. I think the whole point of science and the interest in it has to do with its ability to provide insight and answers into the why of things, at least for me. I also think Yong was really good about explaining the limitations of the research while also making the reader excited about where things could potentially go. Like I think it can be quite hard to straddle that line between talking about the exciting potential of something while also being clear that it might not go anywhere and that there's a lot of complexity and limitation in science. Also he mentioned one of my favorite books of all time, The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life, at the beginning so that automatically made me like the author a lot more. Anyways I really enjoyed this, I know I've been reading a lot of non-fiction so far this year, and this has definitely been one of the best ones so fat this year."
2,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,5,"For my entire hospital career I have worked in oncology, where I have been part of teams taking care of people with cancer. Frequently patients have “neutropenic fevers,” a condition considered to be potentially harmful and almost always requiring admission to the hospital. Neutrophils are those brave little white blood cells that go out into our bodies and do battle with all the nasty things our bodies are exposed to every day. Neutropenia means the patient has none of those cells to speak of (and this is why herd immunity and vaccines are important). We culture blood and urine, scan lungs, treat with antibiotics, and monitor for a few days to see if any microbes grow out in cultures. We teach people to fastidiously handwash, and avoid people who are sick. We make them wear masks in the hallways, in order to filter out airborne viruses. Their rooms have special filtration systems. We encourage them to make safe food choices, avoiding foods that can’t be washed or scrubbed clean, or might be undercooked. And you want to know the kicker? If these patients are infected, it’s usually because of microbes in their own body have run amok and caused infection.You know what else is in the hospital? Microbes. Tons of antibiotic-resistant microbes, hanging out in patient bodies and everywhere else. Once someone is cultured positive for these microbes, they stay on “isolation” for the duration of the visit--and sometimes for life in the case of microbes resistant to all antibiotics--in the (vain) hopes that staff, visitors and patients won’t go moving those resistant microbes around the hospital. A shift where I don’t where a yellow isolation gown to go into these rooms is pretty unusual.Yong made my little grey cells stretch and reach, and now I have yet more ways to think about microbes, and I dearly wish he would re-write this book–maybe in magazine form–every couple years so I can keep up with all the interesting research. Like David Quammen, Yong doesn’t just stick to one branch of research science; he wanders around many fields as he explores the impact microbes have made on us. He’ll first have you thinking about their sheer evolutionary weight (literally and figuratively), reminding us that we evolved in context of a microbe landscape, not the other way round (and some thought apes were a stretch). Like living on a planet where most of the water is saltwater, it makes sense that microbes would impact the evolution of life.Yong walks the reader through some of the science that show how animals evolved to use microbes (and perhaps vice versa?). Some are evolutionary, some genetic, some macro. There’s a lovely experiment where a glowing squid developed a sequestered area for those microbes–can’t set them free in the body, of course, so you have to create a special compartment.In other words, I highly recommend this book. It’s quite well researched and documented, with extensive citations. There’s a bibliography and index, for those that want to delve further or pick and choose. As a further note, I’ll say that I always appreciate researchers/writers who express appreciation for those they interview and follow, without being fawning, and Yong does a nice job with that as well. There are parts I really liked, parts I liked less, parts where someone should have trimmed his descriptive writing just a tad, but any book that keeps me thinking about it months later is a five star read.I’m going to put my detailed book report below page break at my wordpress site ( https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2019/...) with notes heavily on the medical and the ocean science. There’s also some interesting stuff about insects, for those who might lean that way, and trees."

The first associations are not symbiosis and better health but infection and disease because the negative image is over-represented. Hygiene and health are essential, but the benefits of invisible companions are far too rarely highlighted and the beneficial minis outweigh the pests by far. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms is necessary for good health, built on a microorganism friendly diet.Without a symbiosis with a few pounds of microorganisms that are spread over and through the whole body, human life would not be possible, metabolic processes would stop death would be inevitable. A co-evolution has made all higher living beings dependent on the colonizers because they defend humans against enemy invaders which could harm their host. Of course, they also assist with bodily functions because they bring benefits to them so that the motivation for the defense help is not purely altruistic. They form a second front against attackers and it are often the human eaters themselves who are to blame when they wreck their microflora and lose the second shield because of permanently unhealthy nom nom.The coevolution of higher life with invisible helpers is long and has usually developed into a symbiosis. Much has happened since the first bacterium settled in a higher being while it was itself being altered by a virus etc.The ever more severe human intervention in this cycle has led to problems within less than 75 years. Since the advent of antibiotics and serial mass production of drugs, allergies, food sensitivities, autoimmune diseases, multidrug-resistant germs, lifestyle diseases, etc. are on the rise. How much of this is related to the destruction of the natural balance in the body, can be difficult to estimate due to a lack of studies. A one-sided diet with an excessive intake of antibiotics in addition to various other drugs is an essential factor that turns the symbiosis into a dysbiosis.Many drugs include, as a side effect, a mass extinction combined with a collapse of the miniaturized social order, civil wars and a lengthy reconstruction of it. With medicine and hygiene, much money can be made and as a result, super-pathogens grow in hospitals, while chemical gangs in the body of the patients decimate the defense forces of the body.Therapies with alternative and gentler drugs would be a new competitive and biological disinfectant and more expensive than artificial chemicals in the short term without including long-time costs. The patients pay for this with their health and sometimes life.The potential market with tailor-made probiotics and the manipulation and improvement of microfauna with genetically modified organisms is a future-oriented industry. As soon as enough bucks are made with conventional medicine, the Big Players will enter it. Until then it will be vilified and kept down.Actually the effort, according to the standards of medical economics, would not be responsible. Individualized medicine would have to first check the patients for potential vulnerabilities in their microbiome and then create a tailored therapy for them. A great alternative for rich people, but all others continue to receive the standard procedure of conventional treatment that kills friend and foe alike.If one eats microbe-hostile, one gets problems because a healthy, natural and balanced diet ensures a stable and robust micro-environment. Industrially highly processed and unhealthy food kills many of the little helpers and in their places settle less species-rich constellations, sometimes almost monocultures of dodgy creaturs. These not only damage health in addition to the unhealthy diet but also ensure that the desire for excessive and destructive gluttony with junk food never breaks off in the brain. Their interest in a steady supply is justified. A dietary change to fresh, low-fat, salt-reduced and sugar-free diets could significantly reduce their intake. Everyone has to make a choice themselves. Fit and peaceful armies that have lived and protected us for eons or, alternatively, mercenary junkie armies with dubious loyalty, prone to excesses and arson. One willingly lets them move around in the heartland until one loses control over them or they desert and begin dismantling oneself from within. Many times, a supposed protective power has in retrospect proved to be the worst enemy.The brain partakes at every meal and accordingly, the performance can be expanded or reduced. Not only the body feels sluggish after too much food, but the gray cells are overwhelmed too. It is not so much the energy used in digestion or the inertia that sets in with permanent overeating. Much more the fuel of the brain is of poor quality. In the car or an expensive machine, one would not pour substandard gasoline or cheap oil. This mentality does not apply to one's own body. From one-sided nutrition with inferior food of low quality less valuable substances can be extracted, which would be necessary for optimal brain function. One eats oneself dumb.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiota"
4,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten,5,"”The latest estimates suggest that we have around 30 trillion human cells and 39 trillion microbial ones – a roughly even split. Even these numbers are inexact, but that does not really matter: by any reckoning, we contain multitudes.”“Perhaps it is less that I contain multitudes and more that I am multitudes.”I realized, as I was reading this book, that I have not had antibiotics in over twenty-five years. When I shared that information with my friends, the reactions were anywhere from “Wow” to “that is impossible.” Those reactions indicated to me how overly reliant we have become on antibiotics to fight what we perceive to be bad microbes. Of course, antibiotics are indiscriminate in what they kill. They are definitely a kill-them-all-and-let-Odin-sort-them-out kind of killer. ”But antibiotics are shock-and-awe weapons. They kill the bacteria we want as well as those we don’t – an approach that’s like nuking a city to deal with a rat. We don’t even need to see the rat to begin the massacre: many antibiotics are prescribed needlessly to treat viral infections they have no hope of countering.”I don’t get sick very often, and when I do, I seem to get sick to a lesser extent than do other people who are suffering from the same malady. Lucky genetics or maybe I’ve got a well balanced microbiome. I grew up on a farm and was exposed to a lot of microbes, more than the average person. In fact, one of the problems that is plaguing the first world is the fact that a greater percentage of people are not exposed to animals, a great source of useful microbes, or even just the outdoors, where we encounter microbes, bad and good, that help us format a diverse microbiome. They live in concrete worlds that are beneficial to health in the short term, but bad for health in the long term. They don’t run a gauntlet of infectious diseases that actually make them more resilient to illnesses. Their immune systems lack experience and become jumpy, overreacting to allergies and other minor threats. I think we may discover that microbes hold the key to all of our health issues. Big Brother might be watching us go about our daily lives, but what about the control imposed by the Orwellian, brainless, single-cell organisms inside of us? What we eat may not always be our idea. I’ve always been a bit wary of being manipulated by my own hormones, but what if I’m being manipulated by the microbes in my digestive tract as to what foods I like? ”Different microbes fare better on certain diets. Some are peerless at digesting plant fibres. Others thrive on fats. When you choose your meals, you are also choosing which bacteria get fed, and which get an advantage over their peers. But they don’t have to sit there and graciously await your decision. As we have seen, bacteria have ways of hacking into the nervous system. If they released dopamine, a chemical involved in feelings of pleasure and reward, when you ate the ‘right’ things, could they potentially train you to choose certain foods over others? Do they get a say in your menu picks?”So lean people have different levels of certain microbes in their digestive tract than overweight people. They tend to have a more balanced diet, heavy in veggies and fruits. Wonderful news, right? So to lose weight, all we have to do is take microbes from lean people and put them in overweight people. If only it were that easy. The problem is, those lean, mean producing microbes need to eat, so if the overweight person doesn’t change his diet and feed those microbes what they want to eat, they starve. This is, of course, an oversimplification of all the issues that go into trying to improve or change a microbiome, but the possibilities, with further research, are encouraging. I know we all want the magic pill that doesn’t require us to change our lifestyle or food choices, but what if your food preferences are being dictated by a microbe that has hijacked your nervous system to manipulate you into feeding it what it wants? That to me is sort of like being possessed by a demon. “‘America is a constipated nation,’ he said, indelicately. ‘If you pass small stools, you have big hospitals.’” If I miss a day not passing a bowel movement, I get annoyed. I like it when my intestinal tract is working like a well-oiled machine. I want the outgoing to keep up with the incoming. Nothing makes me feel less healthy than to think of BM hanging out in my intestinal tract any longer than it has to. When my digestive tract is working the way I want it to, it is operating to the theme song of Rawhide.
”Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'RawhideShe rollin', rollin', rollin'Though the streams are swollenKeep them doggies rollin', rawhideThrough rain an' wind an' weatherHellbent for leatherMove 'em on, head 'em upHead 'em up, move 'em onMove 'em on, head 'em upRawhide.”
 We are coming out of an era where we were convinced that any microbe was a bad microbe and finally are starting to embrace the idea that some microbes are not only good for us but essential. We pick up microbes from the people around us, and some of those microbes get added to our microbiome. I was reading this article, titled Your Partner could affect Your Microbiome, about a study conducted on heterosexual couples to see how much influence each had on the other’s microbiome. ”After testing the samples, the researchers noted that microbes had been swapped between couples to a significant enough extent that computer algorithms were able to link a person to their partner with an accuracy of 86 percent.” Makes me wonder about the 14%: so how much interaction do you have with your partner? The next thought, of course, is to think about the fact that your partner also brings with her the microbes received from past partners, and now those microbes have been shared with you. *Shudder* It is probably best not to think about it. I came away from reading this book thinking that microbes might provide solutions to many health issues that have plagued us for generations, such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and autoimmune disorders. Microbes have the ability to adapt and borrow from other microbes and change their makeup and purpose. The possibilities are, therefore, endless for us to find elusive cures hidden right in the microscopic multitudes within us. We have used microbes to dengue-fever proof mosquitoes and to save skin infected frogs from Amphibiageddon. My question is, can we use some of those breakthroughs to save the bees and potentially even the human race? The sky's the limit, and only with the very recent change in mindset about microbes have we begun to explore the potential. We have one great advantage…we know microbes exist! So take care of your microbiome, and start by reading this fascinating book. You will look at the world you can’t see with microscopic eyes.

5,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,0,"Update: Antibiotics and obesity. It is routine in the US (although banned in the UK and Canada) to give cows, pigs, chickens etc low doses of antibiotics in order to fatten them up. No one knows why the antibiotics make them gain weight on the same amount of food, but they do. There is no reason to suppose that we are any different. The mechanism has to do with altering the biome, the microbes in the body, but how long the effect lasts isn't known, it might be a lifetime thing.Antibiotics and resistance. We are told that we are overprescribed antibiotics and that is causing resistance, but the amount of antibiotics any individual gets is absolutely minor compared to the amount that we consume. Not only consume from meat, but since animal droppings are used for fertilizer, perhaps from our bread and vegetables and water too. It reminds me of recycling and the emphasis on all of us individuals doing it. However, 98% of all waste is industrial, retail and from restaurants. Go to many supermarkets and they charge you for a plastic bag (if they even have them), go to a 'green' supermarket like Whole Foods and they give a paper one. Then look at the produce, it's packed in plastic, the meat is in styrofoam, the deli salads in plastic, the knife and fork you got to eat them with are plastic, the coffe cup (recyclable!) has a plastic lid, the bottle of juice is probably plastic but the straw is paper. Plastic is cheap and convenient, clean, easy to store and keeps things fresh. Why change if you can make people feel they are the problem and that you are helping them to do the right thing? It's just clever marketing. They are the 98% of the problem and until they address the issues of pollution and climate change in their own industries and stores, no matter how hard we try, we will only make ... 2% of a difference.____________________Schizophrenia used to be blamed on cold mothers, autism likewise, it was the mother's fault. We've moved on now to proving it is the mother getting flu or measles (why didn't she get vaccinated, oh how could she do this and risk inflicting her child.... dadadada. Oh no she couldnt' get vaccinated because that causes.... dadadada).   ""Patterson had read that pregnant women who incur serious infections, like flu or measles, are more likely to have kids with autism and schizophrenia. He thought that a mother's immune responses might somehow affect the development of her baby's brain. He just didn't know how."".......... ""And they realised that Patterson's mice had gut problems in common with actual autistic children: both were likely to have diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal disorders, and both harboured unusual comunities of gut bicrobes. Perhaps, the duo reasoned, fixing those gut problems might also lead to changes in behaviour."" And so it goes on, these male scientists keen to prove that these links to lab mice proved the mother caused autism in her babies. Until, science writer, a woman, Emily Willingham points out that, 
""Mice don't have autism, which is a human neurobiological construct shaped in part by social and cultural perceptions of what is considered normal. Is a mouse repeatedly burying a marble really like a child rocking back and forth? Is a lower frequency of squeaks the same as being unable to talk to other people? If you squint just so, the similarities jump out . Look again and and you might see parallels with other conditions. 
Then the killer - the lab mice used were originally bred to model schizophrenia. So you have scientists saying that the bacteria in the guts of autistic babies and schizophrenic mice who cannot possibly be bred in any way to be autistic proves that it is the mother is responsible, it's just more time is needed to find the proof, the microbes responsible.It's scientific confirmation bias. It's akin to a scientific conspiracy theory. One way or another the mother must be blamed. And say, as the woman science writer says, that all these gut problems can be seen as not just similarities but absolute parallels to other conditions, not autism ."
6,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40898015-jamie,5,"Well, I will never think of bacteria and archaea the same. I certainly have a newfound understanding of just how vital it is to every part of life. That microbes and bacteria have helped shape our planet for billions of years, down to every single flora and fauna; even all the oxygen we breath has come from bacteria. I also never really thought about the microbes that are constantly around us and even on me, or how many you are ""seeding"" to the world. That""every person aerosolises 37 million bacteria per hour"". And, if that isn't crazy enough, how about ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars"". To me, learning all of this was just simply incredible-the effortless symbiosis of microbes with the environment and with ourselves. I could go on and on about this book-so I will end with is, this is hands down one of my favorite science books. The ""science"" wasn't intimidating to read, as the author didn't assume you were already an expert on the subject. It wasn't dry either, and a few parts made me laugh. This book would be great for anyone who is interested in learning about the unseen world going on all around them. "
7,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a fascinating book about the microbes inside all of us, and inside other animals as well. Now, it is often said that there are ten times as many bacteria in our bodies as there are cells. This, it turns out, is probably an over-estimate; the number of bacteria is probably in the same ballpark as the number of cells. But still, that is a lot!This book goes into detail about the amazing partnerships--the symbioses--between microbes and large organisms, mostly animals and humans. Microbes are essential to digestion, to our immune systems, and many other functions.Every person has his own population of microbes, which can be different between individuals. And we spread our microbes around; every day we deposit 30 million of them by breathing, touching things, and by excretions.Most microbes are not harmful to humans. But the distinction between harmful and not harmful and helpful is not always crystal clear. Microbes in our guts help digestion, but if they escape into the blood stream they can be deadly. I really enjoyed learning how dengue can be prevented by infecting mosquitos with a common bacterium called Wolbachia.I learned all sorts of great things. For example, probiotic foods and supplements have not been proven to be effective. Also, toilets that are cleaned too often are more likely to be covered in bacteria. And, hospital rooms with closed windows contain more deadly microbes than the fresh air outside. Some scientists believe that microbes are responsible for obesity, and even for high blood pressure.This book is actually fun to read, filled with subtle humor, and extremely informative. This book is so well written, I must recommend it to everyone."
8,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84916113-somebunny-reads-phoenix,5,"I am Legion.  So, apparently human beings (and all beings in general) are just bags of bacteria and other microorganisms, and these fascinating fellas have always dominated the Earth, from the birth of life to present days: there are more bacteria in our guts than starts in our galaxy. Interesting, uh? I would say a wonderful topic for a wonderful book! I loved this book and found it extremely interesting for many reasons. First, because it was very well-written, and second because it opened my mind to the fascinating field of microbiology, which I'd never think it would be for interest for me (a linguist). This book literally opened a new door for me, and since starting this read I watched documentaries and collected all kinds of information on bacteria, virus, and microorganisms in general. For example, did you know that our body contains so many bacteria that there are roughly the same amount of human cells and bacteria cells inside it? Or that sponges are such simple animals and yet full of microbes that sometimes, if you look at a sponge under a microscope, you will barely be able to see the animal for the microbes that cover it? Or that there is such a thing as a poop transplant (Faecal Microbiota Transplant, or FMT), in which stool samples from one healthy individual are inserted into someone else's intestines to re-create a healthy microbe environment and thus fighting many digestion-related illnesses? This book was all extremely interesting, and I think it also contains two very important messages to always keep in mind: first (something that many people, but not all people, know), that not all microorganisms are bad, and some of them are not only fundamental to sustain life and normal functions of animals and plants, but can also be used to cure health conditions and preserve the environment. Our indiscriminate war against germs, overdoing with disinfectant and antibiotics, is both straightening bad bacteria and endangering good ones, with repercussions on our and our Planets's health. Second, that this field is one of the most futurist fields of science, and we'll probably see incredible developments in the future: the creation of medicines based on probiotics, bacteria artificially engineered to fight diseases; and, incidentally, we'll probably see a lot of this stuff in sci-fi. Of course, as the author himself points out, scientists always have the ambition to find a grand unified theory, a master equation which can elegantly explain our universe, and microbiology, with its recent discoveries on how our life on the Planet started (seriously, look it up or read about it in this book, it's fascinating), how microorganisms are intertwined with hosts in complex symbiotic relationships which can even affect genome, and how much we could potentially do/cure just using bacteria, is currently one of the most fashionable candidates. Without having to believe that bacteria is the solution to all our problems, from dying crops to saving the coral reef and solve both malnutrition and obesity, let alone eradicating lymphatic filariasis and dengue fever; we instead can and should try to educate ourselves more about the microcosm which thrives inside of us and inside the smallest of bugs, so that we can learn how to respect it and be aware of the danger those small little things can pose to us, but also us to them. Bacteria can get extinct too, and who knows how many good friends we used to have in our guts before we killed them and started getting irritable bowls! Save your friendly neighbour bacterium!!! "
9,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,5,"Though we might lather our skin with antibacterial soap, clean our hands with alcohol sanitizers, gargle with mouthwash, scrub our kitchen surfaces, disinfect our bathrooms, spray Lysol all over the house, take antibiotics, etc., there are - and always will be - microbes everywhere. This is especially true of our warm moist bodies - which are covered inside and out with microorganisms....and this is a good thing.Bacteria are on and in our bodiesIn fact our bodies are really an indivisible aggregate of 'our' tissues and organs....and the microbial world that makes its home there. Moreover this is true for every multicellular organism on Earth. The totality of microorganisms (and their parts) in/on our bodies is called our 'microbiome', and it's composed of myriad kinds of bacteria, viruses, archaea, snippets of microbial DNA, and other miniscule microbial fragments. This microbiome helps digest our food, produces vitamins and minerals, breaks down toxins and dangerous chemicals, guides our embryonic development, assists our immune system, probably influences our behavior, and so on. There are many kinds of microbes in the worldIn this entertaining and illuminating book, Yong touches on the evolution of microbes; the history of microbiology; symbiotic relationships among microbes; symbiosis between microbes and higher organisms; dysbiosis (unbalanced microbiomes that harm their hosts); how scientists study and identify microbiomes; research studies aimed at seeding hospitals and buildings with 'good microbes'; and much more.Symbiotic microbes provide nutrients for plantsHospitals are covered with microorganisms. Seeding hospitals with 'good microbes' might prevent 'bad microbes' from growing.Most people probably associate microbes with disease, and Yong provides some examples of pathogenic organisms. The vast majority of microbes are beneficial though, and I was fascinated to read about their varied roles in the world of living things. I've had a rather varied career and in a galaxy far away and long ago I got a degree in microbiology.....but this book has a lot of new and exciting information. I'll give examples of a few intriguing factoids gleaned from the book:1. We can improve our health by nurturing 'helpful' bacteria in our digestive system. Since fiber-loving bacteria are supposed to boost the immune system I added a LOT of fiber to my diet.....and I think I feel healthier already!! We need 'good microbes' in our stomach 2. Newborns are bathed in good microbes during vaginal delivery. Thus, infants born by caesarean section - lacking this initial 'seeding' - develop different microbiomes than vaginal babies. Breast-feeding also provides babies with an initial dose of beneficial microbes. 3. It's good for kids to have a dog because the pooch brings outdoor microbes into the home. Being exposed to a larger variety of microorganisms reduces the likelihood of getting allergies. 4. The author, Ed Yong, really likes the Hawaiian bobtail squid, which contains large colonies of luminous bacteria. Whenever Yong mentions this critter he calls it 'adorable.' (ha ha ha)Bacteria make squids luminous This tome covers a fascinating array of topics in an understandable - and sometimes humorous - fashion. I love this book and would recommend it to everyone.

10,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"Recently I've been hearing reports of miracle cures of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by use of fecal matter transplants. Also I've heard that some autoimmune diseases may be caused by environments that are too clean. Upon hearing these things the question that comes to my mind is, why this new found enthusiasm for microorganisms? We've known about bacteria since Louis Pasteur. So why all this new information about microbes as if it was something new? (Actually we learn in this book that Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered the prevalence of bacteria on all sorts of surfaces in the 1680s, but for unexplained reasons his findings were pretty much ignored for 200 years.) What I learned from this book is that the new technologies of gene sequencing and genomics has changed everything. Before gene sequencing careful study of microbes was limited to those that could be grown on a culture medium. With current tools it is possible to sequence every single gene in a sample from a skin flake, stream bed, or any environmental or body surface. Suddenly researchers were able to provide detailed descriptions of myriad microbiota (This book uses the term microbiome.)What scientists are learning is that the number, variety and prevalence of microorganisms exceeded all expectations. Combined with our understanding of evolution we now know that all of life has co-evolved within close contact with microbes. Consequently many functions of animal life are either dependent on, or aided and regulated by, microorganisms. Food digestion is a leading example of this. This book warns that current science is in the early phases of understanding microbiomes and that we shouldn't become too excited about spectacular claims made by probiotic manufacturers. However, I believe that the wording used by this book in some cases hypes things a bit too much. In particular I'm don't like the way this book makes the statement that, ""The majority of cells in our body are not human, they're microbes."" Technically that statement is true, but it is misleading. The statement is true regarding the number of cells, but not mass (i.e. weight). Only about 1 to 3 percent of the human body weight is from microbes located mostly in the gut. The reason for this disparity between mass and numbers of cells is that most human cells (e.g. muscle, fat, & blood cells) are larger and more massive than bacterial cells. The information I've explained above about the mass of human cells and bacterial cells is not explained in this book. The book simply makes the statement regarding the number of cells which I'm sure will lead some people to make the declarative statement, ""Did you know that most of the human body is made of bugs?""The book explains why we should think of bacteria and viruses as companions, not enemies. Our efforts at being antibacterial—killing all microbial growth—can sometimes provide an environment in which pathogens can proliferate. But there is one quotation in the book by a doctor that provided another perspective to consider. ""I've never seen anybody die from getting antibiotics, but I've seen some die from the lack of them.""Also, our immune system evolved in an environment of mild background contamination. Thus, our modern clean living environments may be a contributor to increased occurrences of some autoimmune ailments. But of course we all know that contaminated environments can cause disease. Perhaps, as we learn more about microbiomes we'll learn to get the level of contamination just right. This book provides a good overall discussion of the expanding knowledge and understanding of microbes.The following is a link to an excerpt from the book about ""when Leeuwenhoek discovered Microorganisms:http://www.delanceyplace.com/view-arc..."
11,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"I liked this book so I am giving it three stars. It is common knowledge today that everything and all of us are covered with microbes - that some are good and some are bad. Their number can be debated. We have in the past been fixated on getting rid of them. This has been to our detriment. It is clear we have gone too far. Antibiotics are good and necessary, but at the same time they must be used with care. In heedlessly wiping out microbes, we have created an environment where pathogens proliferate. This book is about the symbiosis we have with the microbes living on and in our bodies and in our environment. It is about our need to develop a harmonious relationship between us and them. The book begins with a rather long introduction. I wanted the book to get going; what we were being told was all too general. The introduction is followed by a chapter which focuses on the history of bacteriology, beginning with the Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's (1632 - 1723) development of the microscope. He was the first to observe and describe single celled organisms. The growth of microbiology is reviewed through a discussion of the discoveries of scientists such as Louis Pasteur, Élie Metchnikoff, Theodor Rosebury, René Dubos and others. Microbiologists one has heard of and others less well-known. After the historical review, the remainder of the book contains fascinating information on more contemporary studies, but there is no real structure to the presentation. First of all, the titles of the chapters do not clearly indicate what the chapter will be about. Here are four titles so you can see what I mean:-The Long Waltz-Mutually Assured Success-Allegro in E Major -Microbes à la CarteOn completion of a chapter I had learned a smattering of information, all of which I had found interesting, but what exactly that particular chapter was focused upon most often eluded me. Topics brought up in one chapter come up again in another. For me, when reading a non-fiction book on a topic where my own knowledge is weak, I need structure. There is a heavy use of acronyms and scientific abbreviations, which are explained once, but most often just once. The same is true of the scientific terms used for particular experimental procedures, chemical compounds and pathogens. You can read this book without in-depth previous knowledge, but the more you know before you pick it up the easier it will be to understand. It definitely helped me to have recently read The Gene: An Intimate History. Today scientists are sequencing the genes of the microbes around us. Bacteria readily swap genes, something which humans do not do, but our cells can integrate foreign genetic material from bacteria. It is important to stress that we are today only beginning to understand the symbiotic relationship between our cells and the microbes living in, on and around us. This book does not give definitive answers but indicates where the future may take us. Numerous studies are cited. Here follow examples of topics discussed - fecal transplants, probiotics, studies on the bacteria feeding sugars in breast milk, the beneficial qualities of vaginal microbes for babies’ health and gut microbes in preventing obesity and autoimmune diseases, the value of dogs in increasing the microbe diversity in our homes, the decimation of coral reefs, squid with luminous bacteria. The topics are many and not only about humans, but other flora and fauna too. The book provides a lot of really interesting information, but I wanted a better structure to it all.The audiobook is very well narrated by Charlie Anson. Clear and easy to follow. The narration I have given four stars."

""Every time we touch an object, we leave a microbial imprint upon it. Every time we walk, talk, scratch, shuffle, or sneeze, we cast a personalised cloud of microbes into space.

16,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Yong explores the microbiome, not just in humans but in many creatures. He reveals the amazing variety of ways that microorganisms influence their multicellular counterparts. A properly balanced microbiome is not only critical to health, but can be essential to proper development, reproduction and survival. In essence we are one system with the many trillions of foreign organisms in our bodies. We rely on each other. Not that there is a clear cut line between beneficial and pathogenic, a single organism can be both depending on the circumstances. As Yong notes, the immune system is not just a defense against disease causing organisms, it is a manager of our microbiome, ideally operating to maximize its benefits and minimize its dangers.Yong offers numerous examples of the codependence of microbes and animals including humans. One example we can easily relate to concerns a mother’s milk. In human milk there are sugars called human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), over 200 different ones, yet infants are not able to digest them. However, there is a bacteria that eats it all up, Bifidobacterium longum infantis. In return it feeds short-chain fatty acids to the gut cells. B. infantis also helps these cells generate an adhesive to fill gaps between them and it promotes the cells’ manufacture of anti-inflammatory compounds. Not only that, B. infantis helps infant brains grow by producing the sialic acid they need. And there is more. B. infantis attracts some pathogens acting as a decoy preventing them from invading gut cells. This microbe earns its keep.We are familiar with the term symbiosis which applies to the relationship between the microbiome and humans. Endosymbiosis is a more exact description of that relationship since the microbes live in and on us. Yong uses the term dysbiosis to describe when that relationship goes awry, when there is a loss of balance between the microbiome and the immune system. Such an imbalance can contribute to illness and conditions such as nutritional deficiency, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, and many, many more. Unfortunately pinning down the exact constituents of the microbiome responsible is very difficult. Typically there is not one bad actor, but varying mixes of microbes that cause trouble and then only in people with particular genetics or circumstances. Think of your body as an ecosystem. One piece may go astray, but real trouble doesn’t show up until many pieces have been affected, making it exceedingly problematic to understand how the imbalance begins.Biologist Lynn Margulis, persevering in the face of intense criticism, became famous for making the evolutionary role of endosymbiosis credible. Today it is a widely accepted explanation for the mitochondria in our cells which came from a captured bacterium. She also came up with the word holobiant to describe a community of species that stay together throughout their lives including us and our microbiome. This concept can also be applied to genes. Biologists such as Richard Dawkins consider animals and other life forms to be vehicles for genes. Evolution operates to select genes. Their vehicles can change as needed. The genes in our microbiome directly influence our well-being and behavior. Shouldn’t they be considered a part of the set of genes being selected for in our evolution? In other words, the genes of the holobiant together determine the evolutionary vehicle. Consider the example Yong offers of two “species” of closely related flies. They were thought to be separate species. They never mated and they contained different microbiomes. But give them antibiotics and they will successfully mate. Microbes can change an animal’s smell and other factors that can determine mating preference. Eventually these two fly communities with different microbiomes will become distinct species if they never mate. Just as with these flies, it is our hologenome that may be deciding our future.Yong explores the therapeutic potential of changing our microbiome. We make a stab at this today with prebiotics, probiotics and fecal transplants. But to reliably tackle most conditions will require cocktails of bacteria properly proportioned to individual needs. These would require testing for efficacy and safety as would any medicine. We also need to think carefully about how antibiotics and antimicrobials affect the microbiome and the bacteria we encounter. As we begin the age of gene therapy, we can consider not only manipulating the bacteria in our microbiomes but their genes as well. Microbes can be much more easily engineered with genes than can animal cells. Bacteria exchange genes through horizontal transfer. They don’t have to inherit them but can readily pick them up from their neighbors. Thus genes from transient bacteria can get into your microbiome. Astounding, however, is the increasing evidence of bacterial gene horizontal transfer into animal cells. This is particularly true of insects which often have very intimate relationships with bacteria. How this happens needs to be explored. Throughout the book Yong relates example after example of the codependence of animals and bacteria. Bacteria can shape organ development, not only determine sex but change sex after it is established, stop or enable reproduction, stop or enable parasites, provide or block essential nutrients, eradicate or promote a species, decimate or protect a crop, alter the environment and much, much more. Yong makes the case that we need to consider our relationship with bacteria particularly our hologenome if we are to understand our health, our behavior and our future. We are at the beginning of a new appreciation of the role bacteria play in the world, what it means to be human, and new approaches to tackle disease as well as shape our minds and bodies."
17,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49847688-emily,5,"A NEW NONFICTION FAVORITE!!! I'M SO HAPPY.This is absolutely fabulous scientific nonfiction. I think at times, scienctific nonfiction swings one of two ways--over simplified, or overly pendantic. This book truly hit the sweet spot. It's accessible, gorgeously written, and incredibly informative and well-researched.In particular, I liked that Yong doesn't shy away from differing schools of thought. Microbiology as we know it today is still a relatively new science, and as such there are a LOT of different opinions. Yong engages with all of the these. The level of nuance within this book is astounding, and truly elevates it.I also REALLY appreciated that Yong doesn't assume you miraculously remembered every detail from earlier chapters. He would repeat meanings behind acronyms, descriptions of bacteria and cell functions, and a whole lot of other things. However, this never feels repetitive. He's succinct, but also recognizes that his readers might, by chapter 8, forget a line or two from chapter 1. I definitely recommend this!"
18,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50066399-diane-in-australia,4,"I did enjoy this book, but it didn't 'wow' me as much as some of the other reviewers. In fact, I started it awhile ago, and just got distracted by other books, and put it down ... which never happens, if I'm enthralled by a book. When I finally came back to it, I did learn a few things, and read a few things aloud to hubby, so, all-in-all I suppose it was a 'good read'.4 Stars = Outstanding. It definitely held my interest."
19,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17746077-joshua-buhs,4,"A fascinating topic poorly served by the conventions of popular science writing.Ed Yong's book is about microbes--bacteria, mostly, but also viruses and few other extremely small creatures--and how they live with other organisms--humans for the most part, with plenty of other animals, too, though no plants.It has Darwinian ambitions, announced in its subtitle: ""A Grander View of Life"" evokes Darwin's famous phrase closing the first edition of ""On the Origin of Species"": ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.""And it is there in the basic organizing principle of the book. Darwin followed the recommendation of the philosopher of science William Whewell that a good scientific theory account for a range of facts--he called this the ""consilience of induction."" Yong is out to conciliate some inducting, too--so to speak--setting out a view of the interactions between animals and microbes that is extensive.For the past one hundred and fifty or so years, microbes have been mostly seen in the light of germ theory: that is, they have been either classed ad pathological or of little interest. In the last four decades (or so), a new view has taken shape: that microbes are neither good nor bad. But they are ubiquitous. And they are *integral* to multicellular life. Some are pathological. Some perform vital functions. They form an entire ecosystem, one upon which life depends, but one that has been mostly ignored, mostly invisible.As I say, this is a great story, with very important repercussions. The details are fascinating, and Yong is great at explaining the complex interplay between microbes and multicellular organisms in easy to understand ways--that usually do not feel condescending. (I could've used a little less forced humor: de gustibus and all that, though.) Just dipping into the various chapters and reading the sections involves one in some remarkable bits of biology. The book, on the level of the sections, is genuinely fun.There are, of course, important sequelae to this line of thought. One set concerns how we are to live in the world when we know its expanded dimension. Food choices, medicine choices, standard questions about environmental protection--all become more complicated when we have to take microbiology into account. This ""grander view"" of life also calls into question traditional boundaries--between the self and the environment, between humans and other organisms. If bacteria help to build your immune system, what does that mean for ideas about the integrity of the body? If moods and behaviors are effected by gut flora, what does that mean about human will and determinism?Darwin's book was arranged unusually--though brilliantly, in its way. (Waiting twenty years to publish gives certain advantages!) He started with artificial selection, as something most people would understand. Then, in the next two chapters, showed how the elements of artificial selection were inherent in nature, too: one chapter explored natural variety, the other natural competition. Chapter four then tied these various strands together, showing how natural selection worked in nature as an analogue of artificial selection. The remainder of the book--to simplify matters--gathers together a host of facts that can all be explained by natural selection, from the geological record to what we would now call genetics.Yong's book does not work quite so well on the level of chapters. It's fine, but not quite as elegant. There are basically three introductory chapters: one is a prologue, which situates Yong at a zoo watching a scientist investigate the microbial flora on the body of a pangolin. He then moves to another introductory chapter which sets out some guidelines, though these are not consistently used through the book to justify their presence here. He notes that humans are, in effect, islands, homes to vast swarms of bacteria, which can be characterized as neither good nor bad, but as essential to life as we know it. He also introduces the idea that geological time is very long--he's definitely influenced by Darwin and evolutionary biologists, and wants to root the book in its tropes, though they are not really necessary.The second body chapter then introduces us to the idea that various people have looked at microbes over the centuries, to differing ends. He starts with Leeuwenhoek, who was probably the first human to see microbes. But his research into bacteria and similar creatures was never really transformative. He then jumps to the nineteenth century when Pasteur and Koch and the rest put germ theory in place. This was the beginning of what remains the dominant way of looking at microbes.The rest of the chapter then introduces us to the more recent view, which he dates back to the late 1960s with the discovery of a whole new branch of life, the archaebacteria, and then expands to the surveys of microbial life that took off after that. There's a sense that microbiology of the 197os was a lot like American vertebrate biology of the 1900s-1920s, with intensive surveys to characterize most of the major groups and define their geological distribution.This is also the section when Yong could have made a stake for a particular kind of order to the rest of the book, but opted against it. Given that there is a generational element to the story, Yong could have characterized the various schools of microbiology that took shape during this time and given an overview of the people who were involved. Something like what William Leach did with ""The Butterfly People."" If nothing else, it would have helped to make sense of the on-coming chapters, with its huge cast of characters, some recurring, some connected, but the network never quite clear.Instead, what he wants to do is offer a history of ideas--which could work. That's what Darwin did, after all, showing the various ideas that fall under the overarching umbrella, and how they connect. And it is possible to see this, though it is never quite laid out clearly. Part of that is because, for all the introductory matter, the book is never introduced in any but the most general terms. Part of the reason is because the chapter titles are jokey, and so not quite explanatory.Here, though, is a précis of the argument. (It's worth noting that Darwin had expanded chapter explanations in his table of contents, effectively working as a rudimentary index.)Chapter 3. Microbes help build body. Vital functions have been outsourced because microbes are so ubiquitous.Chapter 4. Reintroduces the idea that microbes are neither inherently good nor bad, and even pathological effects can result from certain conditions--in the same way that landscapes can support different kinds of living communities, depending upon their conditions.Chapter 5. Sickness, in people, other organisms, and entire ecosystems, can result from disruptions in the microbial flora. Chapter 6. Animals and their microbes co-evolved.Chapter 7. Because microbes can do so many functions, their coming together with certain organisms allows those organisms to expand into new niches relatively easily. Chapter 8. Genes can be transferred horizontally, from organism to organism.Chapters 9 and 10. The future, and the possibility of microbial engineering.The real reason, though, that it is so difficult to parse out the overall narrative arc is that Yong is in love with the smaller-scale stories. He has been a blogger and writer of magazine articles for many years now, and this experience shows here--to the detriment of the book, I think. With the exception of a few, the chapters do not really lay out a cohesive arguments, but are divided by stories. Again and again, just as Yong is building up to a point, he will take a break and start a new story--with new characters and new creatures.In short, the ideas that are supposed to be driving the story are pushed aside for the story of people. And in the end, the narrative falls between two stools, neither fully the laying out of an idea, nor a group biography, but something in between, and fractured.Apart from making it hard to develop much momentum and to see the forest for the trees, this fragmenting of the book ends up bringing up a whole host of questions that Yong can never really address. Does it matter that one researcher is far from home when she meets with him? Why is another's son hitting Yong in the rear end? Does it matter when World War II was? Talk about conditions leading to (or foreclosing) disease ties into alternative notions of medicine--how does this change in view of microbes relate? Why do Westerners live in an environment that promotes inflammation? Aren't there neo-colonialist concerns with researchers sampling poop from malnourished children? What are the implications of engineering the microbial flora--haven't we learned from big ecological engineering projects?Popular science writing likes to emphasize the humans involved in the science, the work they do, the ideas they have, their personalities and quirks. I get it. But I think the tendency makes it harder to see what Yong is trying to say here. The book is not equipped to answer these questions, and the stories tend to obscure Yong's Darwinian ambitions.Still, he makes some valuable caveats and interventions. As anyone who only half pays attention to debates over nutrition will know, microbes are a big deal--probiotics make lots of money, people are all into feeding the right bugs, and one part of the whole fascination over gluten-free diets is concerns over leaky guts and microbes slipping into the bloodstream. Yong shows how limited the evidence for this talk is, though--particularly probiotics--and as soon as someone starts telling you the exact composition of microbe you need, you should be very wary.And, really, the stories are still fascinating. This last part is what most reviewers I've noticed have focused on, and they are not wrong. Yong got gold of a great subject, and hunted down a huge number of really interesting stories that fit the project. The amount of work that went into the book must have been immense.And, really, when you think of all those accomplishments, it seems churlish to complain that Yong wasn't Darwin also."

If you have a dog, the volume of bacteria in your home increases exponentially. If, gentle reader, you are now scratching and twitching, may I suggest getting a copy of 'I Contain Multitudes' so at least you will know how bacteria function, and why we have them in us, on us, and everywhere else. Author Ed Yong writes for the general reader, explaining that the majority of bacteria are helpful. Good thing, eh? My skin is still crawling. Literally. Anybody else feel like hitting the shower for a good scrub?Author Ed Yong humorously explores the microbiological universe we live in. Several chapters explain that bacteria were the first forms of life on Earth, at least as far as we know, by describing the historical record scientists have sussed out through DNA research. He delves into how some of the more interesting bacteria were discovered, and how scientists are currently exploring how bacteria can be used to improve health. Reader, it is obvious after finishing this book being a hypochondriac is an exercise in futility. If it makes you feel any better, most bacteria are our friends. The Earth would be just rock, water and gas fumes without 'em. So. Learn to love your little invisible pets. They certainly love you. You truly are never alone.'I Contain Multitudes' has an extensive Bibliography and an Index. I read the Kindle ebook, which collected the included photos in the back."

Considering how many books about microbes are popping up, I was skeptical at first, but it quickly became apparent that this book was based on nothing but the best science available on the subject. Just like the Sonnenburgs' book Gut, I contain Multitudes focused on what we know about microbes and was very clear about the lack of evidence when speculating. The researchers cited by Yong are the best in their field. Who Yong *does not cite* is very telling. If you look for an author in Yong's citations (or in the Sonneburgs' citations) and that author is not there, do not trust their book at face value. You will notice that not one reputable microbe researcher and/or book author cites Grain Brain's Perlmutter, whose entire book is made up of misconceptions, sensational claims, and pseudoscience. Some of the most interesting parts of this book include: - Yong's very favorite microbe, Wolbachia, is a fairly magical creature. It is too big to fit into sperm and be passed down through the generations. It can only be carried in eggs. So what is Wolbachia to do if it wants to survive and pass down its genes? Well, it must ensure that as many females as possible survive to carry on its line. Accordingly, it controls the sex of many species as possible (especially arthropods). It either kills the males or alters them in some way to help itself spread through the population. Wolbachia stop female wasps from mating with males. When infected with Wolbachia, the females choose to clone instead. But, if you give the females an antibiotic to wipe out Wolbachia, they begin having sex with males again.In woodlice, Wolbachia interfere with the production of male hormones, ensuring that all woodlice are female or that male woodlice transformed into females. In Blue Moon butterflies Wolbachia kill male embryos, resulting in females outnumbering males by 100 to 1.In other species still, Wolbachia alter sperm in males so that they can only fertilize eggs infected with Wolbachia. (brilliant)Wolbachia is insanely successful, with infections rates often at 100% of the population. The majority of living creatures are arthropods, and 40% of arthropods are infected.- Once it was thought that no microbes could survive conditions at deep ocean vents. However, researchers found myriad forms of life at the vents. There is a worm that has no mouth or anus. To take in nutrients and expel waste products, these worms use the microbes that fill up their bodies. The microbes turn sulfur into the energy (what amazing alchemists!) that maintain the life of the worms, who live without the direct energy of sunlight. - Breastmilk is not for babies. It is to feed the microbes inside babies that are essential for baby's wellbeing and feed the viruses inside babies (the very viruses that make baby sick). - There are no good or bad microbes (this part was simply fantastic). In one species a microbe can be helpful and ""bad"" in another species who it harms. Even in the same individual, microbes are not good or bad. For example, gut bacteria is great.... in the gut. But if it travels to the blood, you have sepsis and die. The bacteria that caused the sepsis isn't ""bad."" It is simply in the wrong place to do its job. When in the blood, it does the same job it does in the intestine, but that is good for the functioning of the gut (and the parts of the body governed by gut microbes) is bad for the bloodstream. Sprinkled throughout the book was the message that, in nature, moderation is key. When is it good to wipe out all microbes? When is it not? How can we know what types of microbes (and at what concentration) are good for which circumstances. - Herbivores have the highest diversity of gut microbes, omnivores had second highest, and carnivores the lowest. Why should this be? Shouldn't animals that eat both plants and animals have more diverse microbes than an animal that only eats plants? Animals that eat only plants need the greatest variety of microbes because it takes tons of enzymes to break down plants but not nearly as much to break down animals. Plants have lot of cellulose and carbs, which are hard to break down. So plant eaters need microbes in great diversity and abundance to accomplish that task.It's funny, but you can think of herbivores as actual mouths. They do the eating of the plant. Their superior microbes break down the plants (just as a mouth and teeth break down food so you can swallow and digest it). Another animal, an omnivore or carnivore, comes along and eats what has essentially already been chewed and broken down. When the omnivore or carnivore eat the herbivore, they have saved themselves the work of breaking down the food. It's done for them. They merely chew it up some more to break it into small enough pieces so their intestine, which has far fewer microbes, can relax and just finish the job of digesting the plants (which hold the sun's energy!) that the herbivore and its microbes already did the hard work of breaking down. Yong gave many excellent examples of various strategies different animals species used for helping guts and microbes work in tandem to digest food. "
22,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"You may think that we are just made from muscles, blood cells, bones and a fair bit of DNA, but in between the gaps are microbes. Billions and billions of them. There are the odd rogue ones, but most of them are useful and make up an essential element of our being. Without them we could not live. They help us in countless ways, sculpting our organs, protecting us from disease and feeding and nourishing us; our gut contains a complete ecosystem that ensure that we extract all the energy we need.Microbes work equal miracles in other animals too, providing the ethereal light that disguises a squid as they hunt, ensuring that koalas are able to digest the unpalatable eucalyptus leaves and the weevil that uses bacteria to make its shell before killing them. The modern worldview of eliminating all microbes is causing as much harm as it is good; people nowdays have a revulsion of all things bacterial, hence the raft of cleaning products that are designed to scour all surfaces and hands clean of these unwanted intruders. However, as Yong successfully argues in this book that not only we might be missing a trick, but our bacterial ecosystem is essential for our survival. A good example of this is in hospitals; the modern view is that all windows have to be locked shut to keep rogue microbes out, but the effect of this is that patients sit in their beds stewing in a lethal mix of micro-organisms. This hazardous situation can be simply solved by opening a window, this allows the dispersal and dilution of the potentially lethal ones. Simple, but very effective.It is a fascinating account of the unseen creatures that live within and all around us. Yong takes us on this journey through the microscope to discover the most recent research from scientists all round the world and tell us of the secrets that are being discovered about microbes. Some of the treatments being developed have the potential to make people’s so lives much better; one example is RePOOpulate – as unappealing as it sounds! However, this treatment has worked miracles with a 94% success rate and no side effects, a success rate not seen in many other cures. Yong writes with an engaging and eloquent style and makes the science in here really accessible. Well worth reading. 4.5 stars."
23,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"Ed Yong is a London-based science writer for The Atlantic and is part of National Geographic’s blogging network. I had trouble believing that I Contain Multitudes is his first book; it’s so fluent and engaging that it immediately draws you into the microbial world and keeps you marveling at its strange yet fascinating workings. Yong writes like a journalist rather than a scientist, and that’s a good thing: with an eye to the average reader, he uses a variety of examples and metaphors, intersperses personal anecdotes of visiting researchers at their labs or in the field, and is careful to recap important facts in a lucid way.The book opens with a visit to San Diego Zoo (see the exclusive extract following my review), where we meet Baba the pangolin. But “Baba is not just a pangolin. He is also a teeming mass of microbes,” Yong explains. “Some of them live inside him, mostly in his gut. Others live on the surface of his face, belly, paws, claws, and scales.” Believe it or not, but we are roughly half and half human cells and microbial cells, making each of us – like all creatures – more of an ecosystem (another term is “holobiont”) than a single entity.Microbes vary between species but also within species, so each individual’s microbiome in some ways reflects a unique mixture of genes and experiences. This is why people’s underarms smell subtly different, and how hyenas use their scent glands to convey messages. The microbiome may well be tailored to different creatures’ functions, so researchers at San Diego Zoo are testing swabs from their animals to see if there could be discernible signatures for burrowing or flying activities, or for disease. I was struck by the breadth of species considered here: not just mammals, but also invertebrates like beetles, cicadas, and squid – my entomologist husband would surely be proud. The “Us” in the subtitle is thus used very inclusively to speak of the way that microbes live in symbiosis with all living things.If I were to boil down Yong’s book to one message, it’s that microbes are not simply “bad” or “good” but have different roles depending on the context and the host. You can hardly dismiss all bacteria as germs that must be eradicated when there are thousands of benign species in your gut (versus fewer than 100 kinds that cause infectious diseases). If it weren’t for the microbes passed on to us at birth, we wouldn’t be able to digest the complex sugars in our mothers’ milk. Other creatures rely on bacteria to help them develop to adulthood, like the tube worms that thrive on Navy ship hulls at Pearl Harbor.Yet Yong feels too little attention is given to beneficial microbes, and in many cases we continue the campaign to rid ourselves of them through overuse of antibiotics and taking cleanliness to unhelpful extremes. “We have been tilting at microbes for too long, and created a world that’s hostile to the ones we need,” he asserts.The book is full of lines like that one that combine a nice turn of phrase and a clever literary allusion. In the title alone, after all, you have references to Walt Whitman (“I contain multitudes” is from his “Song of Myself”) and Charles Darwin (“there is grandeur in this view of life” is part of the closing sentence in his On the Origin of Species). Yong also sets up helpful analogies, comparing the immune system to a thermostat and antibiotics to “shock-and-awe weapons … like nuking a city to deal with a rat.”History and future are also brought together very effectively, with the narrative looking backwards to Leeuwenhoek’s early microscope work and Pasteur and Koch’s germ theory, but also forwards to the prospects that current research into microbes might enable: eliminating elephantiasis, protecting frogs from deadly fungi via probiotics in the soil, fecal microbiota transplants to cure C. diff infections, and so on.The possibilities seem endless, and this is a book that will keep you shaking your head in amazement. I’d liken Yong’s style to David Quammen’s or Rebecca Skloot’s. His clear and intriguing science writing succeeds in inspiring wonder at the natural world and at the bodies that carry us through it.I participated in the official Wellcome Book Prize 2017 blog tour. See my blog review at Bookish Beck for an exclusive extract from the book."
24,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"I Contain Multitudes is science writing at its best: Ed Yong is curious and energetic, and his enthusiasm for bacteria (and wordplay) runneth over in this wide-ranging look at microbiomes within and without. The Whitman-inspired title is apt: we drift through a world teeming with bacteria. Our nonhuman bacterial denizens number in the trillions, and like Pigpen from Peanuts we exude a cloud of our own making, aerosolizing some 37 million bacteria per hour. Yong is quick to dispel the oft-cited back-of-the-napkin calculation that bacterial cells outnumber human cells 10-to-1. The best recent estimates render that split more evenly: roughly 39 trillion microbial cells to 30 trillion [significantly larger] human cells. Still, the point remains that we are hybrid creatures. If there is one takeaway message, it is that bacteria have gotten a bad rap due to our fixation on pathogens. Fewer than 100 bacterial species cause infectious disease in humans, compared to thousands of species [in our guts alone] that range from harmless to essential. If bacteria were to suddenly disappear, life would come to a quick and crashing halt. We need bacteria to digest, to supplement nutrients, to fight infection, and to offload hosts of other responsibilities we are evolved to depend upon.While the book is chock full of interesting factoids (your right hand shares just a sixth of its microbial species with your left hand!) and canvasses the history of human discovery of the microscopic world, most information comes in the form of Yong's interactions with researchers. We learn about connections between bacteria and immunity, and potential developmental connections to autism and schizophrenia. We look at the ever-raging battle between farmers and parasites, and how bacteria can be wielded by aggressor and defender alike. There's a lot of information on the bacteria we inherit from our mothers as we pass through the birth canal, as well as the purpose of milk for a developing child (it feeds important bacteria as well as the baby). We witness tests with bacteria-free mice, swabbed zoo animals, gene sequencing, computer simulations, and various other methods of isolating the causes and effects of bacterial strains. We learn about commercial products that do and do not help (for example, probiotics make sense in theory, but the popular brands do either nothing at all or very little). We are shown the dangerous effects of overusing antibacterial products (themselves bi-products of bacterial warfare) and our misguided attempts to sanitize our environments [read: hospitals] completely. We learn the power of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to both explain much of evolutionary history, to blur the lines between species and genomes, and to give us a potential leg up against parasites. Yong chronicles some successful examples of engineering (such as infecting mosquitos with neutral Wolbachia to combat Dengue fever, or applying transplanted rumen to help Austalian livestock eat Leucaena without consequence), but also some of the ongoing problems like pine beetle forest destruction. We hold our noses while applauding the remarkable promise of fecal transplantation, especially for C-diff, and the ongoing work to address other conditions like IBS and colitis.Yong shares leading theories, discredited theories, promising research, ongoing debates, and a lot of the nuance you don't always get from popular science writing. He's a gifted communicator, and can't resist side commentary with a lot of juicy science and good sense. With each discovery, it becomes readily apparent that we've barely scratched the surface and that quick assumptions and preliminary results almost always mislead, giving way to deeper understanding with ongoing research. Further investigation into the bacterial world will result in exciting advancements in health, materials, food, and a variety of other fields. I hope many people read this and are inspired to join in on the discovery."

26,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32913415-laura,5," When Orson Welles said ""We're born alone, we live alone, we die alone"", he was mistaken. Even when we are alone, we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis--a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. Some animals are colonized by microbes while they are still unfertilized eggs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then proceed through our lives in their presence. When we eat, so do they. When we travel, they come along. When we die, they consume us. Every one of us is a zoo in our own right--a colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collective. An entire world. ~~microscopic view of bacteria on the human tongueEd Yong takes us into an absolutely fascinating world--the unseen world of microscopic life. These tiny life forms were first glimpsed by a Dutchman, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, who thought to look at a drop of water through his handmade lens in the 1660's. He went on to publish detailed drawings of his findings. They garnered him intense attention and fame, and he went on to become a Fellow of the Royal Society. However, he never taught anyone else how to make his superior lenses, and when he died...and his collection went missing...interest waned. But then came the late 1700's and Louis Pasteur. He, along with Robert Koch, did meticulous work showing that bacteria are responsible for diseases formerly attributed to ""bad air"". So microbes permanently entered the lime light, but have been cast, almost exclusively, as a villein. ""It didn't help that just before this wave of discoveries, in 1859, one Charles Darwin had published  On the Origin of Species . 'Through this historical accident, the germ theory of disease developed during the gory phase of Darwinism, where the interplay between living things was regarded as a struggle for survival, when one had to be friend or foe, with no quarter given,' wrote microbiologist Rene Dubos. 'This attitude molded, from the beginning, all later attempts to control microbial diseases. It led to a kind of aggressive warfare against the microbes, aimed at their elimination from the sick individual and the community."" I am, as a registered nurse, a product of this culture. We in modern medicine are proud of the largely successful warfare that we have waged against infectious disease. We've come a VERY long ways from the days in which surgeons, covered in gore, wiped their saw on their apron, and then moved on to their next victim/patient. We maintain meticulous sterile fields. We ""foam in/foam out"" to kill all microbes on our hands before touching patients. We autoclave equipment and sanitize hospital rooms. We prescribe antibiotics for true bacterial infections...and many infections that don't require these weapons. In short, we've solved giant disease and pestilence problems, prolonging human life by decades in the process, but created other issues. We're only now acknowledging the seriousness of these new issues, and the science behind why eradicating bacteria might not be such a good idea.Ed Yong, while not taking sides per se, nevertheless presents a plethora of evidence supporting the beneficial aspects of bacterial life. Yes, infectious disease is still a menace. Yes, antibiotics still save lives every day. However, most bacteria do not cause diseases (except in profoundly immunocompromised hosts), but they crowd out harmful pathogens on surfaces--kitchen counters as well as our skin, toilet seats as well as our guts. Overuse of antibacterial products not only promotes resistant strands of bacteria, it also kills the non-pathogenic organisms...leaving a vacuum that is filled by the most aggressive micro-organisms. But bacteria do far more than simply live on surfaces. They digest food that we can't digest ourselves, they allow squid to glow, they protect insects from predators, they provide the scent in glands which many different animals use to communicate, and they can block the malaria parasite from infecting mosquitoes. In fact, there is compelling evidence that chloroplasts and mitochondria are domesticated bacteria which now cannot live outside plant/animal cells. It would seem that the fate of animal/plant life and bacteria are entwined, for better or for worse. Yong shows ""the long waltz"" that our species have engaged in. Through natural selection bacteria evolve to better serve their hosts, and we (plants/animals) evolve to depend more and more on our bacterial companions. But while the four eukaryotic kingdoms (protists, fungi, plants, and animals) evolve at a rate that isn't particularly noticeable until many generations, bacteria can evolve at an amazingly rapid pace. They can evolve to allow rodents to eat plants that would otherwise be poisonous to them for example. This aspect of bacteria is fascinating to those in the biomed field--where researchers are hoping to discover new ways of combating diseases such as ulcerative colitis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. Far from being the enemy, many bacteria actually have the potential to save us.  My two cents : My above rambling review has barely scratched the surface how mind-blowing Yong's book is. Read this offering to see how complex and down right amazing our world is. Given 5 stars or a rating of ""Perfect"". Highly, highly recommended!!  Further Reading:  Here's a very good article from the National Institutes of Health on beneficial microbes--https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...~~Here's a fascinating look at the newest kingdom, Archaea, from the University of California, Berkley --https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/archaea/arc...~~A link to the University of Utah's page on the evolution of the cell...and an emerging theory of the origins of chloroplasts/mitochondria--https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/conte...~~Finally, H.G. Wells incorporated bacteria into the plot of his novel The War of the Worlds over 100 years ago. I *loved* his ending. But now, the part of me who finds sci-fi interesting has to ask, after reading  I Contain Multitudes , what if we (meaning plants/animals) have evolved to serve as walking vessels for bacteria? What if we serve them instead of the other way around? It's *ahem* food for thought. After all, new research shows that food cravings might be caused by the bacteria in our gut!"

28,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"“Forget Orson Welles, and heed Walt Whitman: “I am large, I contain multitudes.”“'Each animal is an ecosystem with legs,' says John Rawls.""“As palaeontologist Andrew Knoll once said, 'Animals might be evolution's icing, but bacteria are really the cake.'""Yep, Ed Yong knows how to salt and pepper his writing with some good quotes. He also pens some wonderful great-for-quoting prose himself: ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars.""“Within 24 hours of moving into a new place we overwrite it with our own microbes, turning it into a reflection of ourselves.”Yong is a great storyteller and gracefully covers a whole, er, host of topics. This is a broad-ranging book that still manages to go to fantastic depths (at which, by the way, there are many micro-organisms. Exremophiles in particular know how to go where no human has gone before, though we seem to be improving our methods of travel...)Imagine being the first person (known) to look at pond water through a microscope. You see critters moving all around and you think you're seeing things. You try again and again and star looking at all sorts of stuff. Anything you can think of. And almost everywhere you look, these little beings are zipping around. All of a sudden you realize there is a world of activity, an unknown world (or worlds) that has been there all along and their influence and importance is likely on a grand scale. It is kind of a complement to the realization that the earth revolves around the sun (i.e. it's not all about us) and that our solar system is just a few small dots in a vast network of galaxies.Yong follows the first known microscopist (to see microorganisms) into wonder and awe, and then death, and when he dies, Yong follows him back into obscurity (for one or two-hundred years?). And he brings us to the next wave of scientists studying these organisms. He talks of the theories over hundreds or thousands of years used to try to explain the work of microorganisms that was, at that point, invisible, and then brings us closer and closer to the present, as our understanding that microbes affect us grows and yet our comprehension of their intelligence, complexity and range of activity and influence often lags behind. Knowledge is anything but forward moving. There are people who lived thousands of years ago who knew much more about science than many people today. Mostly because people let inflexible (and in my experience, often dangerous) assumptions and ideologies get in the way of processes of learning and, perhaps more importantly, unlearning. For, in order to learn something new, to see something, even if is highy visible and evidence of it is incontrovertible, we often must let go of previously held notions. Yong's book is a testament to all the ways humans are wrong about things, and the endless specificity and self-importance of our vision that makes more omniscient forms of knowledge and wisdom impossible. We are always struggling to understand the world we live in, and we are often failing to see how powerful we are and yet how fallible, vulnerable and small. I wish I could write a better, more thorough review. I listened to this book on audio and I didn't take notes. Or, if I did, I cannot find them. But one of my favorite sections of the book was about worms. The work they do in the soil (and the long-term productivity of organic farming that works in collaboration with them), the revolutionary potential for use of worms to make waste management much more sustainable. And there was an interesting section on the microbiome/microbial communities in houses and hospitals as well as in the body. How trying to kill microbes is much more dangerous than trying to find a healthy balance of them. So much cool stuff in this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in illness and health (of self and community), in building balanced healthy ecosystems rather than trying to solve our problems by eradicating and flattening the communities of microbes in our midst. “Much of modern medicine is built upon the foundations that antibiotics provide, and those foundations are now crumbling.” Here is the list of chapters to give you a bit more of a sense of the trajectory:Living Islands (evolution of eukaryotes, a brief history of biological time)The People Who Thought To Look (Antony van Leeuwenhoek--early microscopists) Body Builders (and he's not talking about gyms.)Terms and Conditions Apply (our love affair with friendly microbes is not the kind of love that is unconditional. It is a lot of work to sustain healthy balances.)In Sickness And In HealthThe Long Waltz (how do symbiotic partnerships begin? How do they evolve?)Mutually Assured SuccessAllegro in E Major (microbes influence on the genome of other animals)Microbes A La Carte (trying to work with the microbiome to fight illness and create healthier body ecosystems)Tomorrow the World"
29,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"First of all, kudos for an excellent title, referencing the poetry of Walt Whitman’s Song of Myself. It is not the only literary reference and I truly appreciate that in a science writer.Yong gives the feeling of being on a safari, observing exotic wildlife. He makes single-celled organisms as interesting as wildebeest and lions. We have come a long way in understanding this part of the ecosystem, and we have miles to go before we perfect that knowledge.The microorganisms were here first. All of the multicellular animals & plants have evolved in concert with them and it should come as no surprise that we have vast colonies of microbes on us & in us. In fact, they are essential to our proper function—witness the microbe-free mice that researchers have created to experiment with these ideas. Their guts and immune systems don’t function properly and the animals don’t behave like normal animals either. Before reading this book, I had a much too simplistic view of the human microbiome. Now I know a number of the factors that can influence it (diet & antibiotics are only two of a long list) and that “good” bacteria can do bad things if the system is out of whack (dysbiosis, my new word for the month).Not to mention cool things like using bacterial infections to control mosquito-bourne diseases!Recommended reading."

Carol Anne Freeling was certainly right when she said, “They’re hee-ur,” well maybe not enraged spirits, but there are certainly plenty of entities present to which we have paid insufficient attention. Maybe Regan MacNeil was closer to the mark in proclaiming “We are legion.” 
 When Orson Welles said “We’re born alone, we live alone, we die alone,” he was mistaken. Even when we are alone, we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis—a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. Some animals are colonized by microbes while they are still unfertilized eggs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then proceed through our lives in their presence.

Trying to map what it is to be a physical human being, in something like the  Human Genome Project, is a daunting task. But our genes tell only part of our story, like a novel with a beginning and ending but no middle. That middle is taken up by the vast array of other life that exists within our bodies. While the guests we harbor may not necessarily be in league with Satan, they are a mixed lot. They mean us no harm, particularly, and we have evolved very workable symbiotic relationships with them, but they are not necessarily our friends either. They took up residence for their own benefit and will stick around and provide benefits to us only as long as we provide what they need, like that girl/boy friend you remember with gritted teeth.I won’t say this book will blow your mind, but this is your brainAnd it’s not even Mardi Gras – from the Brain Association of MississippiThis is your brain after reading this bookShame about that haircut[In the interest of full disclosure, it should be known that every day when my wife was reading this book, she would walk in the door and tell me of yet another thing she had read that had totally blown her mind. Not that my mind didn't go Ka-Boom when I read it. It certainly it. But hers was blown first. I only steal from the best. ]I Contain Multitudes will change how you understand not only the human body, but all the biota on the planet, hell, the universe. It will help you understand how it can happen that diseases like the flu can adapt so quickly to our latest attempts to stamp them out. It will help you understand why coral reefs are dying. It will give you some new words that help keep the new knowledge manageable. (My favorite is dysbiosis which is what it sounds like, a biological parallel to dystopia, with a hint of enforced disorganization.) It will expand your appreciation for how microbial biology works within people and in the world. It will offer you hope that there can be a future in which many of our maladies will not only be diagnosable, but will be treatable with the introduction of the right, specific probiotic. It will do your dishes and massage your feet. Well, ok, not the last two, but KABOOM, big new look-at-the-world stuff. Ok, you biologist types, pre-med, med, post med, anti-med, wearers of white lab coats, whatever the length, you know this stuff, at least I hope you do. But for most of the rest of us it is indeed a big change, a new layer of reality, well maybe not entirely new, but new enough to go KABOOM!Our intro to the world of which Yong writes, antibiotics, is probably akin to the one WW II bombadiers had through their bombsites. Amazing invention/discovery, antibiotics. They do a great job of wiping out pathogens, the nasties that make us ill, well, some of them anyway. Other harmful microbial types, the viral ones, roll their eyes at incoming antibiotics and keep on with what they are up to. However, as with items dropped from passing aircraft, the use of antibiotics entails considerable collateral damage, as the human body is a container for a vast array of microbial life. One might well envision millions of non-pathogenic residents shaking their fists as the incomings not only wipe out the harmful bugs, but vast numbers of the helpful ones as well. Ed Yong offers a more on-the-ground look, filling us in on what is actually going on inside, and how this part of what’s inside relates to that other part.If these folks can have an entire civilization inside a locker, just imagine what might develop in your liver or large intestine.If you don’t know who Ed Yong is, it’s a good bet that you will before too long. Yong is a popular science guy, a Neal DeGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Mary Roach, Jacques Cousteau, David Attenborough, Carl Sagan sort, a person who can take the wild, wonderful and fascinating things that are going on in the world of science and distill them all down for public consumption without making viewers’ or readers’ eyes glaze over, or listeners’ ears suddenly clog, without making you feel like an ill-educated dolt, and he accomplishes this with enough humor to produce a fair number of smiles and an occasional LOL. (Not in Mary Roach’s league for humor, but hey, who is?) He is an award-winning science writer at The Atlantic, whose work has appeared in a wide range of publications, from The New York Times to Nature, from The Guardian to Wired, from Slate to Scientific American, and on and on. He splits his time between London and DC, and I would not be at all surprised if he dashes back and forth in a TARDIS. I have provided links in EXTRA STUFF that will lead you down rabbit holes of fun material from Yong that may take you a while to leave.Ed Yong - From SpeakerpediaAmong the many surprises you will encounter here are a squid with its own high-beams, the microbial advantage of vaginal birth, the impact of gut microbes on mood, why a third of human milk is set aside for our guests (protection payments?), the relationship between the US Navy and mucus, why no man may be an island, but we may be archipelagos, and vats more. There is serious consideration given to how our relationships with this invisible world evolved:
…animals emerged in a world that had already been teeming with microbes for billions of years. They were the rulers of the planet long before we arrived. And when we did arrive, of course we evolved ways of interacting with the microbes around us. It would be absurd not to, like moving into a new city wearing a blindfold, earplugs, and a muzzle. Besides, microbes weren’t just unavoidable: they were useful. They fed the pioneering animals. Their presence also provided valuable cues to areas rich in nutrients, to temperatures conducive to life, or flat surfaces upon which to settle. By sensing these cues, pioneering animals gained valuable information about the world around them…hints of those ancient interactions still abound today.
 “It all depends.” As if life wasn’t complicated enough. Don’t you just love it when you are looking for help and the person you are asking responds with “It all depends.” And it really does, and it really will. What will be different, though, will be that your caregiver will have a much better idea than most caregivers can possibly have today. They will be able to look at a profile from a type of blood test and match potential solutions to the bacteria living in your gut, or wherever else in your two-legged bacteria condo might pertain. This knowledge is still in its infancy – at least a broad knowledge, but it is coming, and has the potential to make meaningful improvements in our health.
As microbiologist Patrice Cani told me, “The future will be a la carte.”And in this a la carte future, we won’t have to stop at picking the right bacteria for the job. Some scientists are picking the right genes for the job, and combining them into artisanal bacteria. Rather than just recruiting species with the right abilities, they are tinkering with the microbes themselves to endow them with new skills. 
Balance – from Explainxkcd.comThis raises some concerns, although they do not get a lot of attention here. If scientists can develop designer probiota to ameliorate suffering, there will always be evil-doers eager to use new technology to make designer biota intended to act as pathogens. In fact that is pretty much my sole gripe about this book. I wish more space had been devoted to the potential dangers of this advancing treatment modality. Just ask yourself, What would ISIS do?The title of Ed Yong’s book may not be up there with The Selfish Gene, Silent Spring, or Guns, Germs and Steel but what it lacks in snappy-ness it more than makes up for in content. This is a smart, readable explanation of one of the major ongoing scientific revolutions of our time. If you look deep inside yourself you will know that this is absolutely must-read material.

31,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"I feel like this book really exemplifies what I want from a science book written for a mass audience. It made everything really accessible and easy to understand without sacrificing on providing details or explanations. It provides a lot of citations so I can go look up the specific research papers and experiments mentioned that are of most interest to me, which I did. It also just connected research to larger ideas and theories for why things work the way they do. I think the whole point of science and the interest in it has to do with its ability to provide insight and answers into the why of things, at least for me. I also think Yong was really good about explaining the limitations of the research while also making the reader excited about where things could potentially go. Like I think it can be quite hard to straddle that line between talking about the exciting potential of something while also being clear that it might not go anywhere and that there's a lot of complexity and limitation in science. Also he mentioned one of my favorite books of all time, The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life, at the beginning so that automatically made me like the author a lot more. Anyways I really enjoyed this, I know I've been reading a lot of non-fiction so far this year, and this has definitely been one of the best ones so fat this year."
32,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,5,"For my entire hospital career I have worked in oncology, where I have been part of teams taking care of people with cancer. Frequently patients have “neutropenic fevers,” a condition considered to be potentially harmful and almost always requiring admission to the hospital. Neutrophils are those brave little white blood cells that go out into our bodies and do battle with all the nasty things our bodies are exposed to every day. Neutropenia means the patient has none of those cells to speak of (and this is why herd immunity and vaccines are important). We culture blood and urine, scan lungs, treat with antibiotics, and monitor for a few days to see if any microbes grow out in cultures. We teach people to fastidiously handwash, and avoid people who are sick. We make them wear masks in the hallways, in order to filter out airborne viruses. Their rooms have special filtration systems. We encourage them to make safe food choices, avoiding foods that can’t be washed or scrubbed clean, or might be undercooked. And you want to know the kicker? If these patients are infected, it’s usually because of microbes in their own body have run amok and caused infection.You know what else is in the hospital? Microbes. Tons of antibiotic-resistant microbes, hanging out in patient bodies and everywhere else. Once someone is cultured positive for these microbes, they stay on “isolation” for the duration of the visit--and sometimes for life in the case of microbes resistant to all antibiotics--in the (vain) hopes that staff, visitors and patients won’t go moving those resistant microbes around the hospital. A shift where I don’t where a yellow isolation gown to go into these rooms is pretty unusual.Yong made my little grey cells stretch and reach, and now I have yet more ways to think about microbes, and I dearly wish he would re-write this book–maybe in magazine form–every couple years so I can keep up with all the interesting research. Like David Quammen, Yong doesn’t just stick to one branch of research science; he wanders around many fields as he explores the impact microbes have made on us. He’ll first have you thinking about their sheer evolutionary weight (literally and figuratively), reminding us that we evolved in context of a microbe landscape, not the other way round (and some thought apes were a stretch). Like living on a planet where most of the water is saltwater, it makes sense that microbes would impact the evolution of life.Yong walks the reader through some of the science that show how animals evolved to use microbes (and perhaps vice versa?). Some are evolutionary, some genetic, some macro. There’s a lovely experiment where a glowing squid developed a sequestered area for those microbes–can’t set them free in the body, of course, so you have to create a special compartment.In other words, I highly recommend this book. It’s quite well researched and documented, with extensive citations. There’s a bibliography and index, for those that want to delve further or pick and choose. As a further note, I’ll say that I always appreciate researchers/writers who express appreciation for those they interview and follow, without being fawning, and Yong does a nice job with that as well. There are parts I really liked, parts I liked less, parts where someone should have trimmed his descriptive writing just a tad, but any book that keeps me thinking about it months later is a five star read.I’m going to put my detailed book report below page break at my wordpress site ( https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2019/...) with notes heavily on the medical and the ocean science. There’s also some interesting stuff about insects, for those who might lean that way, and trees."
33,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"Inner values get, in this context, wholly new, trillion of dimensions.Like so many prejudices, those against microorganisms are stupid and shortsighted. The first associations are not symbiosis and better health but infection and disease because the negative image is over-represented. Hygiene and health are essential, but the benefits of invisible companions are far too rarely highlighted and the beneficial minis outweigh the pests by far. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms is necessary for good health, built on a microorganism friendly diet.Without a symbiosis with a few pounds of microorganisms that are spread over and through the whole body, human life would not be possible, metabolic processes would stop death would be inevitable. A co-evolution has made all higher living beings dependent on the colonizers because they defend humans against enemy invaders which could harm their host. Of course, they also assist with bodily functions because they bring benefits to them so that the motivation for the defense help is not purely altruistic. They form a second front against attackers and it are often the human eaters themselves who are to blame when they wreck their microflora and lose the second shield because of permanently unhealthy nom nom.The coevolution of higher life with invisible helpers is long and has usually developed into a symbiosis. Much has happened since the first bacterium settled in a higher being while it was itself being altered by a virus etc.The ever more severe human intervention in this cycle has led to problems within less than 75 years. Since the advent of antibiotics and serial mass production of drugs, allergies, food sensitivities, autoimmune diseases, multidrug-resistant germs, lifestyle diseases, etc. are on the rise. How much of this is related to the destruction of the natural balance in the body, can be difficult to estimate due to a lack of studies. A one-sided diet with an excessive intake of antibiotics in addition to various other drugs is an essential factor that turns the symbiosis into a dysbiosis.Many drugs include, as a side effect, a mass extinction combined with a collapse of the miniaturized social order, civil wars and a lengthy reconstruction of it. With medicine and hygiene, much money can be made and as a result, super-pathogens grow in hospitals, while chemical gangs in the body of the patients decimate the defense forces of the body.Therapies with alternative and gentler drugs would be a new competitive and biological disinfectant and more expensive than artificial chemicals in the short term without including long-time costs. The patients pay for this with their health and sometimes life.The potential market with tailor-made probiotics and the manipulation and improvement of microfauna with genetically modified organisms is a future-oriented industry. As soon as enough bucks are made with conventional medicine, the Big Players will enter it. Until then it will be vilified and kept down.Actually the effort, according to the standards of medical economics, would not be responsible. Individualized medicine would have to first check the patients for potential vulnerabilities in their microbiome and then create a tailored therapy for them. A great alternative for rich people, but all others continue to receive the standard procedure of conventional treatment that kills friend and foe alike.If one eats microbe-hostile, one gets problems because a healthy, natural and balanced diet ensures a stable and robust micro-environment. Industrially highly processed and unhealthy food kills many of the little helpers and in their places settle less species-rich constellations, sometimes almost monocultures of dodgy creaturs. These not only damage health in addition to the unhealthy diet but also ensure that the desire for excessive and destructive gluttony with junk food never breaks off in the brain. Their interest in a steady supply is justified. A dietary change to fresh, low-fat, salt-reduced and sugar-free diets could significantly reduce their intake. Everyone has to make a choice themselves. Fit and peaceful armies that have lived and protected us for eons or, alternatively, mercenary junkie armies with dubious loyalty, prone to excesses and arson. One willingly lets them move around in the heartland until one loses control over them or they desert and begin dismantling oneself from within. Many times, a supposed protective power has in retrospect proved to be the worst enemy.The brain partakes at every meal and accordingly, the performance can be expanded or reduced. Not only the body feels sluggish after too much food, but the gray cells are overwhelmed too. It is not so much the energy used in digestion or the inertia that sets in with permanent overeating. Much more the fuel of the brain is of poor quality. In the car or an expensive machine, one would not pour substandard gasoline or cheap oil. This mentality does not apply to one's own body. From one-sided nutrition with inferior food of low quality less valuable substances can be extracted, which would be necessary for optimal brain function. One eats oneself dumb.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiota"
34,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten,5,"”The latest estimates suggest that we have around 30 trillion human cells and 39 trillion microbial ones – a roughly even split. Even these numbers are inexact, but that does not really matter: by any reckoning, we contain multitudes.”“Perhaps it is less that I contain multitudes and more that I am multitudes.”I realized, as I was reading this book, that I have not had antibiotics in over twenty-five years. When I shared that information with my friends, the reactions were anywhere from “Wow” to “that is impossible.” Those reactions indicated to me how overly reliant we have become on antibiotics to fight what we perceive to be bad microbes. Of course, antibiotics are indiscriminate in what they kill. They are definitely a kill-them-all-and-let-Odin-sort-them-out kind of killer. ”But antibiotics are shock-and-awe weapons. They kill the bacteria we want as well as those we don’t – an approach that’s like nuking a city to deal with a rat. We don’t even need to see the rat to begin the massacre: many antibiotics are prescribed needlessly to treat viral infections they have no hope of countering.”I don’t get sick very often, and when I do, I seem to get sick to a lesser extent than do other people who are suffering from the same malady. Lucky genetics or maybe I’ve got a well balanced microbiome. I grew up on a farm and was exposed to a lot of microbes, more than the average person. In fact, one of the problems that is plaguing the first world is the fact that a greater percentage of people are not exposed to animals, a great source of useful microbes, or even just the outdoors, where we encounter microbes, bad and good, that help us format a diverse microbiome. They live in concrete worlds that are beneficial to health in the short term, but bad for health in the long term. They don’t run a gauntlet of infectious diseases that actually make them more resilient to illnesses. Their immune systems lack experience and become jumpy, overreacting to allergies and other minor threats. I think we may discover that microbes hold the key to all of our health issues. Big Brother might be watching us go about our daily lives, but what about the control imposed by the Orwellian, brainless, single-cell organisms inside of us? What we eat may not always be our idea. I’ve always been a bit wary of being manipulated by my own hormones, but what if I’m being manipulated by the microbes in my digestive tract as to what foods I like? ”Different microbes fare better on certain diets. Some are peerless at digesting plant fibres. Others thrive on fats. When you choose your meals, you are also choosing which bacteria get fed, and which get an advantage over their peers. But they don’t have to sit there and graciously await your decision. As we have seen, bacteria have ways of hacking into the nervous system. If they released dopamine, a chemical involved in feelings of pleasure and reward, when you ate the ‘right’ things, could they potentially train you to choose certain foods over others? Do they get a say in your menu picks?”So lean people have different levels of certain microbes in their digestive tract than overweight people. They tend to have a more balanced diet, heavy in veggies and fruits. Wonderful news, right? So to lose weight, all we have to do is take microbes from lean people and put them in overweight people. If only it were that easy. The problem is, those lean, mean producing microbes need to eat, so if the overweight person doesn’t change his diet and feed those microbes what they want to eat, they starve. This is, of course, an oversimplification of all the issues that go into trying to improve or change a microbiome, but the possibilities, with further research, are encouraging. I know we all want the magic pill that doesn’t require us to change our lifestyle or food choices, but what if your food preferences are being dictated by a microbe that has hijacked your nervous system to manipulate you into feeding it what it wants? That to me is sort of like being possessed by a demon. “‘America is a constipated nation,’ he said, indelicately. ‘If you pass small stools, you have big hospitals.’” If I miss a day not passing a bowel movement, I get annoyed. I like it when my intestinal tract is working like a well-oiled machine. I want the outgoing to keep up with the incoming. Nothing makes me feel less healthy than to think of BM hanging out in my intestinal tract any longer than it has to. When my digestive tract is working the way I want it to, it is operating to the theme song of Rawhide.
”Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'RawhideShe rollin', rollin', rollin'Though the streams are swollenKeep them doggies rollin', rawhideThrough rain an' wind an' weatherHellbent for leatherMove 'em on, head 'em upHead 'em up, move 'em onMove 'em on, head 'em upRawhide.”
 We are coming out of an era where we were convinced that any microbe was a bad microbe and finally are starting to embrace the idea that some microbes are not only good for us but essential. We pick up microbes from the people around us, and some of those microbes get added to our microbiome. I was reading this article, titled Your Partner could affect Your Microbiome, about a study conducted on heterosexual couples to see how much influence each had on the other’s microbiome. ”After testing the samples, the researchers noted that microbes had been swapped between couples to a significant enough extent that computer algorithms were able to link a person to their partner with an accuracy of 86 percent.” Makes me wonder about the 14%: so how much interaction do you have with your partner? The next thought, of course, is to think about the fact that your partner also brings with her the microbes received from past partners, and now those microbes have been shared with you. *Shudder* It is probably best not to think about it. I came away from reading this book thinking that microbes might provide solutions to many health issues that have plagued us for generations, such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and autoimmune disorders. Microbes have the ability to adapt and borrow from other microbes and change their makeup and purpose. The possibilities are, therefore, endless for us to find elusive cures hidden right in the microscopic multitudes within us. We have used microbes to dengue-fever proof mosquitoes and to save skin infected frogs from Amphibiageddon. My question is, can we use some of those breakthroughs to save the bees and potentially even the human race? The sky's the limit, and only with the very recent change in mindset about microbes have we begun to explore the potential. We have one great advantage…we know microbes exist! So take care of your microbiome, and start by reading this fascinating book. You will look at the world you can’t see with microscopic eyes.

35,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,0,"Update: Antibiotics and obesity. It is routine in the US (although banned in the UK and Canada) to give cows, pigs, chickens etc low doses of antibiotics in order to fatten them up. No one knows why the antibiotics make them gain weight on the same amount of food, but they do. There is no reason to suppose that we are any different. The mechanism has to do with altering the biome, the microbes in the body, but how long the effect lasts isn't known, it might be a lifetime thing.Antibiotics and resistance. We are told that we are overprescribed antibiotics and that is causing resistance, but the amount of antibiotics any individual gets is absolutely minor compared to the amount that we consume. Not only consume from meat, but since animal droppings are used for fertilizer, perhaps from our bread and vegetables and water too. It reminds me of recycling and the emphasis on all of us individuals doing it. However, 98% of all waste is industrial, retail and from restaurants. Go to many supermarkets and they charge you for a plastic bag (if they even have them), go to a 'green' supermarket like Whole Foods and they give a paper one. Then look at the produce, it's packed in plastic, the meat is in styrofoam, the deli salads in plastic, the knife and fork you got to eat them with are plastic, the coffe cup (recyclable!) has a plastic lid, the bottle of juice is probably plastic but the straw is paper. Plastic is cheap and convenient, clean, easy to store and keeps things fresh. Why change if you can make people feel they are the problem and that you are helping them to do the right thing? It's just clever marketing. They are the 98% of the problem and until they address the issues of pollution and climate change in their own industries and stores, no matter how hard we try, we will only make ... 2% of a difference.____________________Schizophrenia used to be blamed on cold mothers, autism likewise, it was the mother's fault. We've moved on now to proving it is the mother getting flu or measles (why didn't she get vaccinated, oh how could she do this and risk inflicting her child.... dadadada. Oh no she couldnt' get vaccinated because that causes.... dadadada).   ""Patterson had read that pregnant women who incur serious infections, like flu or measles, are more likely to have kids with autism and schizophrenia. He thought that a mother's immune responses might somehow affect the development of her baby's brain. He just didn't know how."".......... ""And they realised that Patterson's mice had gut problems in common with actual autistic children: both were likely to have diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal disorders, and both harboured unusual comunities of gut bicrobes. Perhaps, the duo reasoned, fixing those gut problems might also lead to changes in behaviour."" And so it goes on, these male scientists keen to prove that these links to lab mice proved the mother caused autism in her babies. Until, science writer, a woman, Emily Willingham points out that, 
""Mice don't have autism, which is a human neurobiological construct shaped in part by social and cultural perceptions of what is considered normal. Is a mouse repeatedly burying a marble really like a child rocking back and forth? Is a lower frequency of squeaks the same as being unable to talk to other people? If you squint just so, the similarities jump out . Look again and and you might see parallels with other conditions. 
Then the killer - the lab mice used were originally bred to model schizophrenia. So you have scientists saying that the bacteria in the guts of autistic babies and schizophrenic mice who cannot possibly be bred in any way to be autistic proves that it is the mother is responsible, it's just more time is needed to find the proof, the microbes responsible.It's scientific confirmation bias. It's akin to a scientific conspiracy theory. One way or another the mother must be blamed. And say, as the woman science writer says, that all these gut problems can be seen as not just similarities but absolute parallels to other conditions, not autism ."
36,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40898015-jamie,5,"Well, I will never think of bacteria and archaea the same. I certainly have a newfound understanding of just how vital it is to every part of life. That microbes and bacteria have helped shape our planet for billions of years, down to every single flora and fauna; even all the oxygen we breath has come from bacteria. I also never really thought about the microbes that are constantly around us and even on me, or how many you are ""seeding"" to the world. That""every person aerosolises 37 million bacteria per hour"". And, if that isn't crazy enough, how about ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars"". To me, learning all of this was just simply incredible-the effortless symbiosis of microbes with the environment and with ourselves. I could go on and on about this book-so I will end with is, this is hands down one of my favorite science books. The ""science"" wasn't intimidating to read, as the author didn't assume you were already an expert on the subject. It wasn't dry either, and a few parts made me laugh. This book would be great for anyone who is interested in learning about the unseen world going on all around them. "
37,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a fascinating book about the microbes inside all of us, and inside other animals as well. Now, it is often said that there are ten times as many bacteria in our bodies as there are cells. This, it turns out, is probably an over-estimate; the number of bacteria is probably in the same ballpark as the number of cells. But still, that is a lot!This book goes into detail about the amazing partnerships--the symbioses--between microbes and large organisms, mostly animals and humans. Microbes are essential to digestion, to our immune systems, and many other functions.Every person has his own population of microbes, which can be different between individuals. And we spread our microbes around; every day we deposit 30 million of them by breathing, touching things, and by excretions.Most microbes are not harmful to humans. But the distinction between harmful and not harmful and helpful is not always crystal clear. Microbes in our guts help digestion, but if they escape into the blood stream they can be deadly. I really enjoyed learning how dengue can be prevented by infecting mosquitos with a common bacterium called Wolbachia.I learned all sorts of great things. For example, probiotic foods and supplements have not been proven to be effective. Also, toilets that are cleaned too often are more likely to be covered in bacteria. And, hospital rooms with closed windows contain more deadly microbes than the fresh air outside. Some scientists believe that microbes are responsible for obesity, and even for high blood pressure.This book is actually fun to read, filled with subtle humor, and extremely informative. This book is so well written, I must recommend it to everyone."
38,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84916113-somebunny-reads-phoenix,5,"I am Legion.  So, apparently human beings (and all beings in general) are just bags of bacteria and other microorganisms, and these fascinating fellas have always dominated the Earth, from the birth of life to present days: there are more bacteria in our guts than starts in our galaxy. Interesting, uh? I would say a wonderful topic for a wonderful book! I loved this book and found it extremely interesting for many reasons. First, because it was very well-written, and second because it opened my mind to the fascinating field of microbiology, which I'd never think it would be for interest for me (a linguist). This book literally opened a new door for me, and since starting this read I watched documentaries and collected all kinds of information on bacteria, virus, and microorganisms in general. For example, did you know that our body contains so many bacteria that there are roughly the same amount of human cells and bacteria cells inside it? Or that sponges are such simple animals and yet full of microbes that sometimes, if you look at a sponge under a microscope, you will barely be able to see the animal for the microbes that cover it? Or that there is such a thing as a poop transplant (Faecal Microbiota Transplant, or FMT), in which stool samples from one healthy individual are inserted into someone else's intestines to re-create a healthy microbe environment and thus fighting many digestion-related illnesses? This book was all extremely interesting, and I think it also contains two very important messages to always keep in mind: first (something that many people, but not all people, know), that not all microorganisms are bad, and some of them are not only fundamental to sustain life and normal functions of animals and plants, but can also be used to cure health conditions and preserve the environment. Our indiscriminate war against germs, overdoing with disinfectant and antibiotics, is both straightening bad bacteria and endangering good ones, with repercussions on our and our Planets's health. Second, that this field is one of the most futurist fields of science, and we'll probably see incredible developments in the future: the creation of medicines based on probiotics, bacteria artificially engineered to fight diseases; and, incidentally, we'll probably see a lot of this stuff in sci-fi. Of course, as the author himself points out, scientists always have the ambition to find a grand unified theory, a master equation which can elegantly explain our universe, and microbiology, with its recent discoveries on how our life on the Planet started (seriously, look it up or read about it in this book, it's fascinating), how microorganisms are intertwined with hosts in complex symbiotic relationships which can even affect genome, and how much we could potentially do/cure just using bacteria, is currently one of the most fashionable candidates. Without having to believe that bacteria is the solution to all our problems, from dying crops to saving the coral reef and solve both malnutrition and obesity, let alone eradicating lymphatic filariasis and dengue fever; we instead can and should try to educate ourselves more about the microcosm which thrives inside of us and inside the smallest of bugs, so that we can learn how to respect it and be aware of the danger those small little things can pose to us, but also us to them. Bacteria can get extinct too, and who knows how many good friends we used to have in our guts before we killed them and started getting irritable bowls! Save your friendly neighbour bacterium!!! "

This is especially true of our warm moist bodies - which are covered inside and out with microorganisms....and this is a good thing.Bacteria are on and in our bodiesIn fact our bodies are really an indivisible aggregate of 'our' tissues and organs....and the microbial world that makes its home there. Moreover this is true for every multicellular organism on Earth. The totality of microorganisms (and their parts) in/on our bodies is called our 'microbiome', and it's composed of myriad kinds of bacteria, viruses, archaea, snippets of microbial DNA, and other miniscule microbial fragments. This microbiome helps digest our food, produces vitamins and minerals, breaks down toxins and dangerous chemicals, guides our embryonic development, assists our immune system, probably influences our behavior, and so on. There are many kinds of microbes in the worldIn this entertaining and illuminating book, Yong touches on the evolution of microbes; the history of microbiology; symbiotic relationships among microbes; symbiosis between microbes and higher organisms; dysbiosis (unbalanced microbiomes that harm their hosts); how scientists study and identify microbiomes; research studies aimed at seeding hospitals and buildings with 'good microbes'; and much more.Symbiotic microbes provide nutrients for plantsHospitals are covered with microorganisms. Seeding hospitals with 'good microbes' might prevent 'bad microbes' from growing.Most people probably associate microbes with disease, and Yong provides some examples of pathogenic organisms. The vast majority of microbes are beneficial though, and I was fascinated to read about their varied roles in the world of living things. I've had a rather varied career and in a galaxy far away and long ago I got a degree in microbiology.....but this book has a lot of new and exciting information. I'll give examples of a few intriguing factoids gleaned from the book:1. We can improve our health by nurturing 'helpful' bacteria in our digestive system. Since fiber-loving bacteria are supposed to boost the immune system I added a LOT of fiber to my diet.....and I think I feel healthier already!! We need 'good microbes' in our stomach 2. Newborns are bathed in good microbes during vaginal delivery. Thus, infants born by caesarean section - lacking this initial 'seeding' - develop different microbiomes than vaginal babies. Breast-feeding also provides babies with an initial dose of beneficial microbes. 3. It's good for kids to have a dog because the pooch brings outdoor microbes into the home. Being exposed to a larger variety of microorganisms reduces the likelihood of getting allergies. 4. The author, Ed Yong, really likes the Hawaiian bobtail squid, which contains large colonies of luminous bacteria. Whenever Yong mentions this critter he calls it 'adorable.' (ha ha ha)Bacteria make squids luminous This tome covers a fascinating array of topics in an understandable - and sometimes humorous - fashion. I love this book and would recommend it to everyone.

40,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"Recently I've been hearing reports of miracle cures of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by use of fecal matter transplants. Also I've heard that some autoimmune diseases may be caused by environments that are too clean. Upon hearing these things the question that comes to my mind is, why this new found enthusiasm for microorganisms? We've known about bacteria since Louis Pasteur. So why all this new information about microbes as if it was something new? (Actually we learn in this book that Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered the prevalence of bacteria on all sorts of surfaces in the 1680s, but for unexplained reasons his findings were pretty much ignored for 200 years.) What I learned from this book is that the new technologies of gene sequencing and genomics has changed everything. Before gene sequencing careful study of microbes was limited to those that could be grown on a culture medium. With current tools it is possible to sequence every single gene in a sample from a skin flake, stream bed, or any environmental or body surface. Suddenly researchers were able to provide detailed descriptions of myriad microbiota (This book uses the term microbiome.)What scientists are learning is that the number, variety and prevalence of microorganisms exceeded all expectations. Combined with our understanding of evolution we now know that all of life has co-evolved within close contact with microbes. Consequently many functions of animal life are either dependent on, or aided and regulated by, microorganisms. Food digestion is a leading example of this. This book warns that current science is in the early phases of understanding microbiomes and that we shouldn't become too excited about spectacular claims made by probiotic manufacturers. However, I believe that the wording used by this book in some cases hypes things a bit too much. In particular I'm don't like the way this book makes the statement that, ""The majority of cells in our body are not human, they're microbes."" Technically that statement is true, but it is misleading. The statement is true regarding the number of cells, but not mass (i.e. weight). Only about 1 to 3 percent of the human body weight is from microbes located mostly in the gut. The reason for this disparity between mass and numbers of cells is that most human cells (e.g. muscle, fat, & blood cells) are larger and more massive than bacterial cells. The information I've explained above about the mass of human cells and bacterial cells is not explained in this book. The book simply makes the statement regarding the number of cells which I'm sure will lead some people to make the declarative statement, ""Did you know that most of the human body is made of bugs?""The book explains why we should think of bacteria and viruses as companions, not enemies. Our efforts at being antibacterial—killing all microbial growth—can sometimes provide an environment in which pathogens can proliferate. But there is one quotation in the book by a doctor that provided another perspective to consider. ""I've never seen anybody die from getting antibiotics, but I've seen some die from the lack of them.""Also, our immune system evolved in an environment of mild background contamination. Thus, our modern clean living environments may be a contributor to increased occurrences of some autoimmune ailments. But of course we all know that contaminated environments can cause disease. Perhaps, as we learn more about microbiomes we'll learn to get the level of contamination just right. This book provides a good overall discussion of the expanding knowledge and understanding of microbes.The following is a link to an excerpt from the book about ""when Leeuwenhoek discovered Microorganisms:http://www.delanceyplace.com/view-arc..."
41,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"I liked this book so I am giving it three stars. It is common knowledge today that everything and all of us are covered with microbes - that some are good and some are bad. Their number can be debated. We have in the past been fixated on getting rid of them. This has been to our detriment. It is clear we have gone too far. Antibiotics are good and necessary, but at the same time they must be used with care. In heedlessly wiping out microbes, we have created an environment where pathogens proliferate. This book is about the symbiosis we have with the microbes living on and in our bodies and in our environment. It is about our need to develop a harmonious relationship between us and them. The book begins with a rather long introduction. I wanted the book to get going; what we were being told was all too general. The introduction is followed by a chapter which focuses on the history of bacteriology, beginning with the Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's (1632 - 1723) development of the microscope. He was the first to observe and describe single celled organisms. The growth of microbiology is reviewed through a discussion of the discoveries of scientists such as Louis Pasteur, Élie Metchnikoff, Theodor Rosebury, René Dubos and others. Microbiologists one has heard of and others less well-known. After the historical review, the remainder of the book contains fascinating information on more contemporary studies, but there is no real structure to the presentation. First of all, the titles of the chapters do not clearly indicate what the chapter will be about. Here are four titles so you can see what I mean:-The Long Waltz-Mutually Assured Success-Allegro in E Major -Microbes à la CarteOn completion of a chapter I had learned a smattering of information, all of which I had found interesting, but what exactly that particular chapter was focused upon most often eluded me. Topics brought up in one chapter come up again in another. For me, when reading a non-fiction book on a topic where my own knowledge is weak, I need structure. There is a heavy use of acronyms and scientific abbreviations, which are explained once, but most often just once. The same is true of the scientific terms used for particular experimental procedures, chemical compounds and pathogens. You can read this book without in-depth previous knowledge, but the more you know before you pick it up the easier it will be to understand. It definitely helped me to have recently read The Gene: An Intimate History. Today scientists are sequencing the genes of the microbes around us. Bacteria readily swap genes, something which humans do not do, but our cells can integrate foreign genetic material from bacteria. It is important to stress that we are today only beginning to understand the symbiotic relationship between our cells and the microbes living in, on and around us. This book does not give definitive answers but indicates where the future may take us. Numerous studies are cited. Here follow examples of topics discussed - fecal transplants, probiotics, studies on the bacteria feeding sugars in breast milk, the beneficial qualities of vaginal microbes for babies’ health and gut microbes in preventing obesity and autoimmune diseases, the value of dogs in increasing the microbe diversity in our homes, the decimation of coral reefs, squid with luminous bacteria. The topics are many and not only about humans, but other flora and fauna too. The book provides a lot of really interesting information, but I wanted a better structure to it all.The audiobook is very well narrated by Charlie Anson. Clear and easy to follow. The narration I have given four stars."

""Every time we touch an object, we leave a microbial imprint upon it. Every time we walk, talk, scratch, shuffle, or sneeze, we cast a personalised cloud of microbes into space.

46,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Yong explores the microbiome, not just in humans but in many creatures. He reveals the amazing variety of ways that microorganisms influence their multicellular counterparts. A properly balanced microbiome is not only critical to health, but can be essential to proper development, reproduction and survival. In essence we are one system with the many trillions of foreign organisms in our bodies. We rely on each other. Not that there is a clear cut line between beneficial and pathogenic, a single organism can be both depending on the circumstances. As Yong notes, the immune system is not just a defense against disease causing organisms, it is a manager of our microbiome, ideally operating to maximize its benefits and minimize its dangers.Yong offers numerous examples of the codependence of microbes and animals including humans. One example we can easily relate to concerns a mother’s milk. In human milk there are sugars called human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), over 200 different ones, yet infants are not able to digest them. However, there is a bacteria that eats it all up, Bifidobacterium longum infantis. In return it feeds short-chain fatty acids to the gut cells. B. infantis also helps these cells generate an adhesive to fill gaps between them and it promotes the cells’ manufacture of anti-inflammatory compounds. Not only that, B. infantis helps infant brains grow by producing the sialic acid they need. And there is more. B. infantis attracts some pathogens acting as a decoy preventing them from invading gut cells. This microbe earns its keep.We are familiar with the term symbiosis which applies to the relationship between the microbiome and humans. Endosymbiosis is a more exact description of that relationship since the microbes live in and on us. Yong uses the term dysbiosis to describe when that relationship goes awry, when there is a loss of balance between the microbiome and the immune system. Such an imbalance can contribute to illness and conditions such as nutritional deficiency, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, and many, many more. Unfortunately pinning down the exact constituents of the microbiome responsible is very difficult. Typically there is not one bad actor, but varying mixes of microbes that cause trouble and then only in people with particular genetics or circumstances. Think of your body as an ecosystem. One piece may go astray, but real trouble doesn’t show up until many pieces have been affected, making it exceedingly problematic to understand how the imbalance begins.Biologist Lynn Margulis, persevering in the face of intense criticism, became famous for making the evolutionary role of endosymbiosis credible. Today it is a widely accepted explanation for the mitochondria in our cells which came from a captured bacterium. She also came up with the word holobiant to describe a community of species that stay together throughout their lives including us and our microbiome. This concept can also be applied to genes. Biologists such as Richard Dawkins consider animals and other life forms to be vehicles for genes. Evolution operates to select genes. Their vehicles can change as needed. The genes in our microbiome directly influence our well-being and behavior. Shouldn’t they be considered a part of the set of genes being selected for in our evolution? In other words, the genes of the holobiant together determine the evolutionary vehicle. Consider the example Yong offers of two “species” of closely related flies. They were thought to be separate species. They never mated and they contained different microbiomes. But give them antibiotics and they will successfully mate. Microbes can change an animal’s smell and other factors that can determine mating preference. Eventually these two fly communities with different microbiomes will become distinct species if they never mate. Just as with these flies, it is our hologenome that may be deciding our future.Yong explores the therapeutic potential of changing our microbiome. We make a stab at this today with prebiotics, probiotics and fecal transplants. But to reliably tackle most conditions will require cocktails of bacteria properly proportioned to individual needs. These would require testing for efficacy and safety as would any medicine. We also need to think carefully about how antibiotics and antimicrobials affect the microbiome and the bacteria we encounter. As we begin the age of gene therapy, we can consider not only manipulating the bacteria in our microbiomes but their genes as well. Microbes can be much more easily engineered with genes than can animal cells. Bacteria exchange genes through horizontal transfer. They don’t have to inherit them but can readily pick them up from their neighbors. Thus genes from transient bacteria can get into your microbiome. Astounding, however, is the increasing evidence of bacterial gene horizontal transfer into animal cells. This is particularly true of insects which often have very intimate relationships with bacteria. How this happens needs to be explored. Throughout the book Yong relates example after example of the codependence of animals and bacteria. Bacteria can shape organ development, not only determine sex but change sex after it is established, stop or enable reproduction, stop or enable parasites, provide or block essential nutrients, eradicate or promote a species, decimate or protect a crop, alter the environment and much, much more. Yong makes the case that we need to consider our relationship with bacteria particularly our hologenome if we are to understand our health, our behavior and our future. We are at the beginning of a new appreciation of the role bacteria play in the world, what it means to be human, and new approaches to tackle disease as well as shape our minds and bodies."
47,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49847688-emily,5,"A NEW NONFICTION FAVORITE!!! I'M SO HAPPY.This is absolutely fabulous scientific nonfiction. I think at times, scienctific nonfiction swings one of two ways--over simplified, or overly pendantic. This book truly hit the sweet spot. It's accessible, gorgeously written, and incredibly informative and well-researched.In particular, I liked that Yong doesn't shy away from differing schools of thought. Microbiology as we know it today is still a relatively new science, and as such there are a LOT of different opinions. Yong engages with all of the these. The level of nuance within this book is astounding, and truly elevates it.I also REALLY appreciated that Yong doesn't assume you miraculously remembered every detail from earlier chapters. He would repeat meanings behind acronyms, descriptions of bacteria and cell functions, and a whole lot of other things. However, this never feels repetitive. He's succinct, but also recognizes that his readers might, by chapter 8, forget a line or two from chapter 1. I definitely recommend this!"
48,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50066399-diane-in-australia,4,"I did enjoy this book, but it didn't 'wow' me as much as some of the other reviewers. In fact, I started it awhile ago, and just got distracted by other books, and put it down ... which never happens, if I'm enthralled by a book. When I finally came back to it, I did learn a few things, and read a few things aloud to hubby, so, all-in-all I suppose it was a 'good read'.4 Stars = Outstanding. It definitely held my interest."
49,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17746077-joshua-buhs,4,"A fascinating topic poorly served by the conventions of popular science writing.Ed Yong's book is about microbes--bacteria, mostly, but also viruses and few other extremely small creatures--and how they live with other organisms--humans for the most part, with plenty of other animals, too, though no plants.It has Darwinian ambitions, announced in its subtitle: ""A Grander View of Life"" evokes Darwin's famous phrase closing the first edition of ""On the Origin of Species"": ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.""And it is there in the basic organizing principle of the book. Darwin followed the recommendation of the philosopher of science William Whewell that a good scientific theory account for a range of facts--he called this the ""consilience of induction."" Yong is out to conciliate some inducting, too--so to speak--setting out a view of the interactions between animals and microbes that is extensive.For the past one hundred and fifty or so years, microbes have been mostly seen in the light of germ theory: that is, they have been either classed ad pathological or of little interest. In the last four decades (or so), a new view has taken shape: that microbes are neither good nor bad. But they are ubiquitous. And they are *integral* to multicellular life. Some are pathological. Some perform vital functions. They form an entire ecosystem, one upon which life depends, but one that has been mostly ignored, mostly invisible.As I say, this is a great story, with very important repercussions. The details are fascinating, and Yong is great at explaining the complex interplay between microbes and multicellular organisms in easy to understand ways--that usually do not feel condescending. (I could've used a little less forced humor: de gustibus and all that, though.) Just dipping into the various chapters and reading the sections involves one in some remarkable bits of biology. The book, on the level of the sections, is genuinely fun.There are, of course, important sequelae to this line of thought. One set concerns how we are to live in the world when we know its expanded dimension. Food choices, medicine choices, standard questions about environmental protection--all become more complicated when we have to take microbiology into account. This ""grander view"" of life also calls into question traditional boundaries--between the self and the environment, between humans and other organisms. If bacteria help to build your immune system, what does that mean for ideas about the integrity of the body? If moods and behaviors are effected by gut flora, what does that mean about human will and determinism?Darwin's book was arranged unusually--though brilliantly, in its way. (Waiting twenty years to publish gives certain advantages!) He started with artificial selection, as something most people would understand. Then, in the next two chapters, showed how the elements of artificial selection were inherent in nature, too: one chapter explored natural variety, the other natural competition. Chapter four then tied these various strands together, showing how natural selection worked in nature as an analogue of artificial selection. The remainder of the book--to simplify matters--gathers together a host of facts that can all be explained by natural selection, from the geological record to what we would now call genetics.Yong's book does not work quite so well on the level of chapters. It's fine, but not quite as elegant. There are basically three introductory chapters: one is a prologue, which situates Yong at a zoo watching a scientist investigate the microbial flora on the body of a pangolin. He then moves to another introductory chapter which sets out some guidelines, though these are not consistently used through the book to justify their presence here. He notes that humans are, in effect, islands, homes to vast swarms of bacteria, which can be characterized as neither good nor bad, but as essential to life as we know it. He also introduces the idea that geological time is very long--he's definitely influenced by Darwin and evolutionary biologists, and wants to root the book in its tropes, though they are not really necessary.The second body chapter then introduces us to the idea that various people have looked at microbes over the centuries, to differing ends. He starts with Leeuwenhoek, who was probably the first human to see microbes. But his research into bacteria and similar creatures was never really transformative. He then jumps to the nineteenth century when Pasteur and Koch and the rest put germ theory in place. This was the beginning of what remains the dominant way of looking at microbes.The rest of the chapter then introduces us to the more recent view, which he dates back to the late 1960s with the discovery of a whole new branch of life, the archaebacteria, and then expands to the surveys of microbial life that took off after that. There's a sense that microbiology of the 197os was a lot like American vertebrate biology of the 1900s-1920s, with intensive surveys to characterize most of the major groups and define their geological distribution.This is also the section when Yong could have made a stake for a particular kind of order to the rest of the book, but opted against it. Given that there is a generational element to the story, Yong could have characterized the various schools of microbiology that took shape during this time and given an overview of the people who were involved. Something like what William Leach did with ""The Butterfly People."" If nothing else, it would have helped to make sense of the on-coming chapters, with its huge cast of characters, some recurring, some connected, but the network never quite clear.Instead, what he wants to do is offer a history of ideas--which could work. That's what Darwin did, after all, showing the various ideas that fall under the overarching umbrella, and how they connect. And it is possible to see this, though it is never quite laid out clearly. Part of that is because, for all the introductory matter, the book is never introduced in any but the most general terms. Part of the reason is because the chapter titles are jokey, and so not quite explanatory.Here, though, is a précis of the argument. (It's worth noting that Darwin had expanded chapter explanations in his table of contents, effectively working as a rudimentary index.)Chapter 3. Microbes help build body. Vital functions have been outsourced because microbes are so ubiquitous.Chapter 4. Reintroduces the idea that microbes are neither inherently good nor bad, and even pathological effects can result from certain conditions--in the same way that landscapes can support different kinds of living communities, depending upon their conditions.Chapter 5. Sickness, in people, other organisms, and entire ecosystems, can result from disruptions in the microbial flora. Chapter 6. Animals and their microbes co-evolved.Chapter 7. Because microbes can do so many functions, their coming together with certain organisms allows those organisms to expand into new niches relatively easily. Chapter 8. Genes can be transferred horizontally, from organism to organism.Chapters 9 and 10. The future, and the possibility of microbial engineering.The real reason, though, that it is so difficult to parse out the overall narrative arc is that Yong is in love with the smaller-scale stories. He has been a blogger and writer of magazine articles for many years now, and this experience shows here--to the detriment of the book, I think. With the exception of a few, the chapters do not really lay out a cohesive arguments, but are divided by stories. Again and again, just as Yong is building up to a point, he will take a break and start a new story--with new characters and new creatures.In short, the ideas that are supposed to be driving the story are pushed aside for the story of people. And in the end, the narrative falls between two stools, neither fully the laying out of an idea, nor a group biography, but something in between, and fractured.Apart from making it hard to develop much momentum and to see the forest for the trees, this fragmenting of the book ends up bringing up a whole host of questions that Yong can never really address. Does it matter that one researcher is far from home when she meets with him? Why is another's son hitting Yong in the rear end? Does it matter when World War II was? Talk about conditions leading to (or foreclosing) disease ties into alternative notions of medicine--how does this change in view of microbes relate? Why do Westerners live in an environment that promotes inflammation? Aren't there neo-colonialist concerns with researchers sampling poop from malnourished children? What are the implications of engineering the microbial flora--haven't we learned from big ecological engineering projects?Popular science writing likes to emphasize the humans involved in the science, the work they do, the ideas they have, their personalities and quirks. I get it. But I think the tendency makes it harder to see what Yong is trying to say here. The book is not equipped to answer these questions, and the stories tend to obscure Yong's Darwinian ambitions.Still, he makes some valuable caveats and interventions. As anyone who only half pays attention to debates over nutrition will know, microbes are a big deal--probiotics make lots of money, people are all into feeding the right bugs, and one part of the whole fascination over gluten-free diets is concerns over leaky guts and microbes slipping into the bloodstream. Yong shows how limited the evidence for this talk is, though--particularly probiotics--and as soon as someone starts telling you the exact composition of microbe you need, you should be very wary.And, really, the stories are still fascinating. This last part is what most reviewers I've noticed have focused on, and they are not wrong. Yong got gold of a great subject, and hunted down a huge number of really interesting stories that fit the project. The amount of work that went into the book must have been immense.And, really, when you think of all those accomplishments, it seems churlish to complain that Yong wasn't Darwin also."

Inside our bodies and in our cells, we have even more interesting little microscopic monsters. Plus, we share these little bugs with everyone we meet, especially the people we live with. If you have a dog, the volume of bacteria in your home increases exponentially. If, gentle reader, you are now scratching and twitching, may I suggest getting a copy of 'I Contain Multitudes' so at least you will know how bacteria function, and why we have them in us, on us, and everywhere else. Author Ed Yong writes for the general reader, explaining that the majority of bacteria are helpful. Good thing, eh? My skin is still crawling. Literally. Anybody else feel like hitting the shower for a good scrub?Author Ed Yong humorously explores the microbiological universe we live in. Several chapters explain that bacteria were the first forms of life on Earth, at least as far as we know, by describing the historical record scientists have sussed out through DNA research. He delves into how some of the more interesting bacteria were discovered, and how scientists are currently exploring how bacteria can be used to improve health. Reader, it is obvious after finishing this book being a hypochondriac is an exercise in futility. If it makes you feel any better, most bacteria are our friends. The Earth would be just rock, water and gas fumes without 'em. So. Learn to love your little invisible pets. They certainly love you. You truly are never alone.'I Contain Multitudes' has an extensive Bibliography and an Index. I read the Kindle ebook, which collected the included photos in the back."
51,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"This book is jam-packed with tons of information about the recently uncovered world of microbes. Considering how many books about microbes are popping up, I was skeptical at first, but it quickly became apparent that this book was based on nothing but the best science available on the subject. Just like the Sonnenburgs' book Gut, I contain Multitudes focused on what we know about microbes and was very clear about the lack of evidence when speculating. The researchers cited by Yong are the best in their field. Who Yong *does not cite* is very telling. If you look for an author in Yong's citations (or in the Sonneburgs' citations) and that author is not there, do not trust their book at face value. You will notice that not one reputable microbe researcher and/or book author cites Grain Brain's Perlmutter, whose entire book is made up of misconceptions, sensational claims, and pseudoscience. Some of the most interesting parts of this book include: - Yong's very favorite microbe, Wolbachia, is a fairly magical creature. It is too big to fit into sperm and be passed down through the generations. It can only be carried in eggs. So what is Wolbachia to do if it wants to survive and pass down its genes? Well, it must ensure that as many females as possible survive to carry on its line. Accordingly, it controls the sex of many species as possible (especially arthropods). It either kills the males or alters them in some way to help itself spread through the population. Wolbachia stop female wasps from mating with males. When infected with Wolbachia, the females choose to clone instead. But, if you give the females an antibiotic to wipe out Wolbachia, they begin having sex with males again.In woodlice, Wolbachia interfere with the production of male hormones, ensuring that all woodlice are female or that male woodlice transformed into females. In Blue Moon butterflies Wolbachia kill male embryos, resulting in females outnumbering males by 100 to 1.In other species still, Wolbachia alter sperm in males so that they can only fertilize eggs infected with Wolbachia. (brilliant)Wolbachia is insanely successful, with infections rates often at 100% of the population. The majority of living creatures are arthropods, and 40% of arthropods are infected.- Once it was thought that no microbes could survive conditions at deep ocean vents. However, researchers found myriad forms of life at the vents. There is a worm that has no mouth or anus. To take in nutrients and expel waste products, these worms use the microbes that fill up their bodies. The microbes turn sulfur into the energy (what amazing alchemists!) that maintain the life of the worms, who live without the direct energy of sunlight. - Breastmilk is not for babies. It is to feed the microbes inside babies that are essential for baby's wellbeing and feed the viruses inside babies (the very viruses that make baby sick). - There are no good or bad microbes (this part was simply fantastic). In one species a microbe can be helpful and ""bad"" in another species who it harms. Even in the same individual, microbes are not good or bad. For example, gut bacteria is great.... in the gut. But if it travels to the blood, you have sepsis and die. The bacteria that caused the sepsis isn't ""bad."" It is simply in the wrong place to do its job. When in the blood, it does the same job it does in the intestine, but that is good for the functioning of the gut (and the parts of the body governed by gut microbes) is bad for the bloodstream. Sprinkled throughout the book was the message that, in nature, moderation is key. When is it good to wipe out all microbes? When is it not? How can we know what types of microbes (and at what concentration) are good for which circumstances. - Herbivores have the highest diversity of gut microbes, omnivores had second highest, and carnivores the lowest. Why should this be? Shouldn't animals that eat both plants and animals have more diverse microbes than an animal that only eats plants? Animals that eat only plants need the greatest variety of microbes because it takes tons of enzymes to break down plants but not nearly as much to break down animals. Plants have lot of cellulose and carbs, which are hard to break down. So plant eaters need microbes in great diversity and abundance to accomplish that task.It's funny, but you can think of herbivores as actual mouths. They do the eating of the plant. Their superior microbes break down the plants (just as a mouth and teeth break down food so you can swallow and digest it). Another animal, an omnivore or carnivore, comes along and eats what has essentially already been chewed and broken down. When the omnivore or carnivore eat the herbivore, they have saved themselves the work of breaking down the food. It's done for them. They merely chew it up some more to break it into small enough pieces so their intestine, which has far fewer microbes, can relax and just finish the job of digesting the plants (which hold the sun's energy!) that the herbivore and its microbes already did the hard work of breaking down. Yong gave many excellent examples of various strategies different animals species used for helping guts and microbes work in tandem to digest food. "

Billions and billions of them. There are the odd rogue ones, but most of them are useful and make up an essential element of our being. Without them we could not live. They help us in countless ways, sculpting our organs, protecting us from disease and feeding and nourishing us; our gut contains a complete ecosystem that ensure that we extract all the energy we need.Microbes work equal miracles in other animals too, providing the ethereal light that disguises a squid as they hunt, ensuring that koalas are able to digest the unpalatable eucalyptus leaves and the weevil that uses bacteria to make its shell before killing them. The modern worldview of eliminating all microbes is causing as much harm as it is good; people nowdays have a revulsion of all things bacterial, hence the raft of cleaning products that are designed to scour all surfaces and hands clean of these unwanted intruders. However, as Yong successfully argues in this book that not only we might be missing a trick, but our bacterial ecosystem is essential for our survival. A good example of this is in hospitals; the modern view is that all windows have to be locked shut to keep rogue microbes out, but the effect of this is that patients sit in their beds stewing in a lethal mix of micro-organisms. This hazardous situation can be simply solved by opening a window, this allows the dispersal and dilution of the potentially lethal ones. Simple, but very effective.It is a fascinating account of the unseen creatures that live within and all around us. Yong takes us on this journey through the microscope to discover the most recent research from scientists all round the world and tell us of the secrets that are being discovered about microbes. Some of the treatments being developed have the potential to make people’s so lives much better; one example is RePOOpulate – as unappealing as it sounds! However, this treatment has worked miracles with a 94% success rate and no side effects, a success rate not seen in many other cures. Yong writes with an engaging and eloquent style and makes the science in here really accessible. Well worth reading. 4.5 stars."
53,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"Ed Yong is a London-based science writer for The Atlantic and is part of National Geographic’s blogging network. I had trouble believing that I Contain Multitudes is his first book; it’s so fluent and engaging that it immediately draws you into the microbial world and keeps you marveling at its strange yet fascinating workings. Yong writes like a journalist rather than a scientist, and that’s a good thing: with an eye to the average reader, he uses a variety of examples and metaphors, intersperses personal anecdotes of visiting researchers at their labs or in the field, and is careful to recap important facts in a lucid way.The book opens with a visit to San Diego Zoo (see the exclusive extract following my review), where we meet Baba the pangolin. But “Baba is not just a pangolin. He is also a teeming mass of microbes,” Yong explains. “Some of them live inside him, mostly in his gut. Others live on the surface of his face, belly, paws, claws, and scales.” Believe it or not, but we are roughly half and half human cells and microbial cells, making each of us – like all creatures – more of an ecosystem (another term is “holobiont”) than a single entity.Microbes vary between species but also within species, so each individual’s microbiome in some ways reflects a unique mixture of genes and experiences. This is why people’s underarms smell subtly different, and how hyenas use their scent glands to convey messages. The microbiome may well be tailored to different creatures’ functions, so researchers at San Diego Zoo are testing swabs from their animals to see if there could be discernible signatures for burrowing or flying activities, or for disease. I was struck by the breadth of species considered here: not just mammals, but also invertebrates like beetles, cicadas, and squid – my entomologist husband would surely be proud. The “Us” in the subtitle is thus used very inclusively to speak of the way that microbes live in symbiosis with all living things.If I were to boil down Yong’s book to one message, it’s that microbes are not simply “bad” or “good” but have different roles depending on the context and the host. You can hardly dismiss all bacteria as germs that must be eradicated when there are thousands of benign species in your gut (versus fewer than 100 kinds that cause infectious diseases). If it weren’t for the microbes passed on to us at birth, we wouldn’t be able to digest the complex sugars in our mothers’ milk. Other creatures rely on bacteria to help them develop to adulthood, like the tube worms that thrive on Navy ship hulls at Pearl Harbor.Yet Yong feels too little attention is given to beneficial microbes, and in many cases we continue the campaign to rid ourselves of them through overuse of antibiotics and taking cleanliness to unhelpful extremes. “We have been tilting at microbes for too long, and created a world that’s hostile to the ones we need,” he asserts.The book is full of lines like that one that combine a nice turn of phrase and a clever literary allusion. In the title alone, after all, you have references to Walt Whitman (“I contain multitudes” is from his “Song of Myself”) and Charles Darwin (“there is grandeur in this view of life” is part of the closing sentence in his On the Origin of Species). Yong also sets up helpful analogies, comparing the immune system to a thermostat and antibiotics to “shock-and-awe weapons … like nuking a city to deal with a rat.”History and future are also brought together very effectively, with the narrative looking backwards to Leeuwenhoek’s early microscope work and Pasteur and Koch’s germ theory, but also forwards to the prospects that current research into microbes might enable: eliminating elephantiasis, protecting frogs from deadly fungi via probiotics in the soil, fecal microbiota transplants to cure C. diff infections, and so on.The possibilities seem endless, and this is a book that will keep you shaking your head in amazement. I’d liken Yong’s style to David Quammen’s or Rebecca Skloot’s. His clear and intriguing science writing succeeds in inspiring wonder at the natural world and at the bodies that carry us through it.I participated in the official Wellcome Book Prize 2017 blog tour. See my blog review at Bookish Beck for an exclusive extract from the book."
54,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"I Contain Multitudes is science writing at its best: Ed Yong is curious and energetic, and his enthusiasm for bacteria (and wordplay) runneth over in this wide-ranging look at microbiomes within and without. The Whitman-inspired title is apt: we drift through a world teeming with bacteria. Our nonhuman bacterial denizens number in the trillions, and like Pigpen from Peanuts we exude a cloud of our own making, aerosolizing some 37 million bacteria per hour. Yong is quick to dispel the oft-cited back-of-the-napkin calculation that bacterial cells outnumber human cells 10-to-1. The best recent estimates render that split more evenly: roughly 39 trillion microbial cells to 30 trillion [significantly larger] human cells. Still, the point remains that we are hybrid creatures. If there is one takeaway message, it is that bacteria have gotten a bad rap due to our fixation on pathogens. Fewer than 100 bacterial species cause infectious disease in humans, compared to thousands of species [in our guts alone] that range from harmless to essential. If bacteria were to suddenly disappear, life would come to a quick and crashing halt. We need bacteria to digest, to supplement nutrients, to fight infection, and to offload hosts of other responsibilities we are evolved to depend upon.While the book is chock full of interesting factoids (your right hand shares just a sixth of its microbial species with your left hand!) and canvasses the history of human discovery of the microscopic world, most information comes in the form of Yong's interactions with researchers. We learn about connections between bacteria and immunity, and potential developmental connections to autism and schizophrenia. We look at the ever-raging battle between farmers and parasites, and how bacteria can be wielded by aggressor and defender alike. There's a lot of information on the bacteria we inherit from our mothers as we pass through the birth canal, as well as the purpose of milk for a developing child (it feeds important bacteria as well as the baby). We witness tests with bacteria-free mice, swabbed zoo animals, gene sequencing, computer simulations, and various other methods of isolating the causes and effects of bacterial strains. We learn about commercial products that do and do not help (for example, probiotics make sense in theory, but the popular brands do either nothing at all or very little). We are shown the dangerous effects of overusing antibacterial products (themselves bi-products of bacterial warfare) and our misguided attempts to sanitize our environments [read: hospitals] completely. We learn the power of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to both explain much of evolutionary history, to blur the lines between species and genomes, and to give us a potential leg up against parasites. Yong chronicles some successful examples of engineering (such as infecting mosquitos with neutral Wolbachia to combat Dengue fever, or applying transplanted rumen to help Austalian livestock eat Leucaena without consequence), but also some of the ongoing problems like pine beetle forest destruction. We hold our noses while applauding the remarkable promise of fecal transplantation, especially for C-diff, and the ongoing work to address other conditions like IBS and colitis.Yong shares leading theories, discredited theories, promising research, ongoing debates, and a lot of the nuance you don't always get from popular science writing. He's a gifted communicator, and can't resist side commentary with a lot of juicy science and good sense. With each discovery, it becomes readily apparent that we've barely scratched the surface and that quick assumptions and preliminary results almost always mislead, giving way to deeper understanding with ongoing research. Further investigation into the bacterial world will result in exciting advancements in health, materials, food, and a variety of other fields. I hope many people read this and are inspired to join in on the discovery."

56,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32913415-laura,5," When Orson Welles said ""We're born alone, we live alone, we die alone"", he was mistaken. Even when we are alone, we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis--a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. Some animals are colonized by microbes while they are still unfertilized eggs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then proceed through our lives in their presence. When we eat, so do they. When we travel, they come along. When we die, they consume us. Every one of us is a zoo in our own right--a colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collective. An entire world. ~~microscopic view of bacteria on the human tongueEd Yong takes us into an absolutely fascinating world--the unseen world of microscopic life. These tiny life forms were first glimpsed by a Dutchman, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, who thought to look at a drop of water through his handmade lens in the 1660's. He went on to publish detailed drawings of his findings. They garnered him intense attention and fame, and he went on to become a Fellow of the Royal Society. However, he never taught anyone else how to make his superior lenses, and when he died...and his collection went missing...interest waned. But then came the late 1700's and Louis Pasteur. He, along with Robert Koch, did meticulous work showing that bacteria are responsible for diseases formerly attributed to ""bad air"". So microbes permanently entered the lime light, but have been cast, almost exclusively, as a villein. ""It didn't help that just before this wave of discoveries, in 1859, one Charles Darwin had published  On the Origin of Species . 'Through this historical accident, the germ theory of disease developed during the gory phase of Darwinism, where the interplay between living things was regarded as a struggle for survival, when one had to be friend or foe, with no quarter given,' wrote microbiologist Rene Dubos. 'This attitude molded, from the beginning, all later attempts to control microbial diseases. It led to a kind of aggressive warfare against the microbes, aimed at their elimination from the sick individual and the community."" I am, as a registered nurse, a product of this culture. We in modern medicine are proud of the largely successful warfare that we have waged against infectious disease. We've come a VERY long ways from the days in which surgeons, covered in gore, wiped their saw on their apron, and then moved on to their next victim/patient. We maintain meticulous sterile fields. We ""foam in/foam out"" to kill all microbes on our hands before touching patients. We autoclave equipment and sanitize hospital rooms. We prescribe antibiotics for true bacterial infections...and many infections that don't require these weapons. In short, we've solved giant disease and pestilence problems, prolonging human life by decades in the process, but created other issues. We're only now acknowledging the seriousness of these new issues, and the science behind why eradicating bacteria might not be such a good idea.Ed Yong, while not taking sides per se, nevertheless presents a plethora of evidence supporting the beneficial aspects of bacterial life. Yes, infectious disease is still a menace. Yes, antibiotics still save lives every day. However, most bacteria do not cause diseases (except in profoundly immunocompromised hosts), but they crowd out harmful pathogens on surfaces--kitchen counters as well as our skin, toilet seats as well as our guts. Overuse of antibacterial products not only promotes resistant strands of bacteria, it also kills the non-pathogenic organisms...leaving a vacuum that is filled by the most aggressive micro-organisms. But bacteria do far more than simply live on surfaces. They digest food that we can't digest ourselves, they allow squid to glow, they protect insects from predators, they provide the scent in glands which many different animals use to communicate, and they can block the malaria parasite from infecting mosquitoes. In fact, there is compelling evidence that chloroplasts and mitochondria are domesticated bacteria which now cannot live outside plant/animal cells. It would seem that the fate of animal/plant life and bacteria are entwined, for better or for worse. Yong shows ""the long waltz"" that our species have engaged in. Through natural selection bacteria evolve to better serve their hosts, and we (plants/animals) evolve to depend more and more on our bacterial companions. But while the four eukaryotic kingdoms (protists, fungi, plants, and animals) evolve at a rate that isn't particularly noticeable until many generations, bacteria can evolve at an amazingly rapid pace. They can evolve to allow rodents to eat plants that would otherwise be poisonous to them for example. This aspect of bacteria is fascinating to those in the biomed field--where researchers are hoping to discover new ways of combating diseases such as ulcerative colitis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. Far from being the enemy, many bacteria actually have the potential to save us.  My two cents : My above rambling review has barely scratched the surface how mind-blowing Yong's book is. Read this offering to see how complex and down right amazing our world is. Given 5 stars or a rating of ""Perfect"". Highly, highly recommended!!  Further Reading:  Here's a very good article from the National Institutes of Health on beneficial microbes--https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...~~Here's a fascinating look at the newest kingdom, Archaea, from the University of California, Berkley --https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/archaea/arc...~~A link to the University of Utah's page on the evolution of the cell...and an emerging theory of the origins of chloroplasts/mitochondria--https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/conte...~~Finally, H.G. Wells incorporated bacteria into the plot of his novel The War of the Worlds over 100 years ago. I *loved* his ending. But now, the part of me who finds sci-fi interesting has to ask, after reading  I Contain Multitudes , what if we (meaning plants/animals) have evolved to serve as walking vessels for bacteria? What if we serve them instead of the other way around? It's *ahem* food for thought. After all, new research shows that food cravings might be caused by the bacteria in our gut!"

58,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"“Forget Orson Welles, and heed Walt Whitman: “I am large, I contain multitudes.”“'Each animal is an ecosystem with legs,' says John Rawls.""“As palaeontologist Andrew Knoll once said, 'Animals might be evolution's icing, but bacteria are really the cake.'""Yep, Ed Yong knows how to salt and pepper his writing with some good quotes. He also pens some wonderful great-for-quoting prose himself: ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars.""“Within 24 hours of moving into a new place we overwrite it with our own microbes, turning it into a reflection of ourselves.”Yong is a great storyteller and gracefully covers a whole, er, host of topics. This is a broad-ranging book that still manages to go to fantastic depths (at which, by the way, there are many micro-organisms. Exremophiles in particular know how to go where no human has gone before, though we seem to be improving our methods of travel...)Imagine being the first person (known) to look at pond water through a microscope. You see critters moving all around and you think you're seeing things. You try again and again and star looking at all sorts of stuff. Anything you can think of. And almost everywhere you look, these little beings are zipping around. All of a sudden you realize there is a world of activity, an unknown world (or worlds) that has been there all along and their influence and importance is likely on a grand scale. It is kind of a complement to the realization that the earth revolves around the sun (i.e. it's not all about us) and that our solar system is just a few small dots in a vast network of galaxies.Yong follows the first known microscopist (to see microorganisms) into wonder and awe, and then death, and when he dies, Yong follows him back into obscurity (for one or two-hundred years?). And he brings us to the next wave of scientists studying these organisms. He talks of the theories over hundreds or thousands of years used to try to explain the work of microorganisms that was, at that point, invisible, and then brings us closer and closer to the present, as our understanding that microbes affect us grows and yet our comprehension of their intelligence, complexity and range of activity and influence often lags behind. Knowledge is anything but forward moving. There are people who lived thousands of years ago who knew much more about science than many people today. Mostly because people let inflexible (and in my experience, often dangerous) assumptions and ideologies get in the way of processes of learning and, perhaps more importantly, unlearning. For, in order to learn something new, to see something, even if is highy visible and evidence of it is incontrovertible, we often must let go of previously held notions. Yong's book is a testament to all the ways humans are wrong about things, and the endless specificity and self-importance of our vision that makes more omniscient forms of knowledge and wisdom impossible. We are always struggling to understand the world we live in, and we are often failing to see how powerful we are and yet how fallible, vulnerable and small. I wish I could write a better, more thorough review. I listened to this book on audio and I didn't take notes. Or, if I did, I cannot find them. But one of my favorite sections of the book was about worms. The work they do in the soil (and the long-term productivity of organic farming that works in collaboration with them), the revolutionary potential for use of worms to make waste management much more sustainable. And there was an interesting section on the microbiome/microbial communities in houses and hospitals as well as in the body. How trying to kill microbes is much more dangerous than trying to find a healthy balance of them. So much cool stuff in this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in illness and health (of self and community), in building balanced healthy ecosystems rather than trying to solve our problems by eradicating and flattening the communities of microbes in our midst. “Much of modern medicine is built upon the foundations that antibiotics provide, and those foundations are now crumbling.” Here is the list of chapters to give you a bit more of a sense of the trajectory:Living Islands (evolution of eukaryotes, a brief history of biological time)The People Who Thought To Look (Antony van Leeuwenhoek--early microscopists) Body Builders (and he's not talking about gyms.)Terms and Conditions Apply (our love affair with friendly microbes is not the kind of love that is unconditional. It is a lot of work to sustain healthy balances.)In Sickness And In HealthThe Long Waltz (how do symbiotic partnerships begin? How do they evolve?)Mutually Assured SuccessAllegro in E Major (microbes influence on the genome of other animals)Microbes A La Carte (trying to work with the microbiome to fight illness and create healthier body ecosystems)Tomorrow the World"
59,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"First of all, kudos for an excellent title, referencing the poetry of Walt Whitman’s Song of Myself. It is not the only literary reference and I truly appreciate that in a science writer.Yong gives the feeling of being on a safari, observing exotic wildlife. He makes single-celled organisms as interesting as wildebeest and lions. We have come a long way in understanding this part of the ecosystem, and we have miles to go before we perfect that knowledge.The microorganisms were here first. All of the multicellular animals & plants have evolved in concert with them and it should come as no surprise that we have vast colonies of microbes on us & in us. In fact, they are essential to our proper function—witness the microbe-free mice that researchers have created to experiment with these ideas. Their guts and immune systems don’t function properly and the animals don’t behave like normal animals either. Before reading this book, I had a much too simplistic view of the human microbiome. Now I know a number of the factors that can influence it (diet & antibiotics are only two of a long list) and that “good” bacteria can do bad things if the system is out of whack (dysbiosis, my new word for the month).Not to mention cool things like using bacterial infections to control mosquito-bourne diseases!Recommended reading."

Carol Anne Freeling was certainly right when she said, “They’re hee-ur,” well maybe not enraged spirits, but there are certainly plenty of entities present to which we have paid insufficient attention. Maybe Regan MacNeil was closer to the mark in proclaiming “We are legion.” 
 When Orson Welles said “We’re born alone, we live alone, we die alone,” he was mistaken. Even when we are alone, we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis—a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. Some animals are colonized by microbes while they are still unfertilized eggs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then proceed through our lives in their presence.

Trying to map what it is to be a physical human being, in something like the  Human Genome Project, is a daunting task. But our genes tell only part of our story, like a novel with a beginning and ending but no middle. That middle is taken up by the vast array of other life that exists within our bodies. While the guests we harbor may not necessarily be in league with Satan, they are a mixed lot. They mean us no harm, particularly, and we have evolved very workable symbiotic relationships with them, but they are not necessarily our friends either. They took up residence for their own benefit and will stick around and provide benefits to us only as long as we provide what they need, like that girl/boy friend you remember with gritted teeth.I won’t say this book will blow your mind, but this is your brainAnd it’s not even Mardi Gras – from the Brain Association of MississippiThis is your brain after reading this bookShame about that haircut[In the interest of full disclosure, it should be known that every day when my wife was reading this book, she would walk in the door and tell me of yet another thing she had read that had totally blown her mind.

I only steal from the best. ]I Contain Multitudes will change how you understand not only the human body, but all the biota on the planet, hell, the universe. It will help you understand how it can happen that diseases like the flu can adapt so quickly to our latest attempts to stamp them out. It will help you understand why coral reefs are dying. It will give you some new words that help keep the new knowledge manageable. (My favorite is dysbiosis which is what it sounds like, a biological parallel to dystopia, with a hint of enforced disorganization.) It will expand your appreciation for how microbial biology works within people and in the world. It will offer you hope that there can be a future in which many of our maladies will not only be diagnosable, but will be treatable with the introduction of the right, specific probiotic. It will do your dishes and massage your feet. Well, ok, not the last two, but KABOOM, big new look-at-the-world stuff. Ok, you biologist types, pre-med, med, post med, anti-med, wearers of white lab coats, whatever the length, you know this stuff, at least I hope you do. But for most of the rest of us it is indeed a big change, a new layer of reality, well maybe not entirely new, but new enough to go KABOOM!Our intro to the world of which Yong writes, antibiotics, is probably akin to the one WW II bombadiers had through their bombsites. Amazing invention/discovery, antibiotics. They do a great job of wiping out pathogens, the nasties that make us ill, well, some of them anyway. Other harmful microbial types, the viral ones, roll their eyes at incoming antibiotics and keep on with what they are up to. However, as with items dropped from passing aircraft, the use of antibiotics entails considerable collateral damage, as the human body is a container for a vast array of microbial life. One might well envision millions of non-pathogenic residents shaking their fists as the incomings not only wipe out the harmful bugs, but vast numbers of the helpful ones as well. Ed Yong offers a more on-the-ground look, filling us in on what is actually going on inside, and how this part of what’s inside relates to that other part.If these folks can have an entire civilization inside a locker, just imagine what might develop in your liver or large intestine.If you don’t know who Ed Yong is, it’s a good bet that you will before too long. Yong is a popular science guy, a Neal DeGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Mary Roach, Jacques Cousteau, David Attenborough, Carl Sagan sort, a person who can take the wild, wonderful and fascinating things that are going on in the world of science and distill them all down for public consumption without making viewers’ or readers’ eyes glaze over, or listeners’ ears suddenly clog, without making you feel like an ill-educated dolt, and he accomplishes this with enough humor to produce a fair number of smiles and an occasional LOL. (Not in Mary Roach’s league for humor, but hey, who is?) He is an award-winning science writer at The Atlantic, whose work has appeared in a wide range of publications, from The New York Times to Nature, from The Guardian to Wired, from Slate to Scientific American, and on and on. He splits his time between London and DC, and I would not be at all surprised if he dashes back and forth in a TARDIS. I have provided links in EXTRA STUFF that will lead you down rabbit holes of fun material from Yong that may take you a while to leave.Ed Yong - From SpeakerpediaAmong the many surprises you will encounter here are a squid with its own high-beams, the microbial advantage of vaginal birth, the impact of gut microbes on mood, why a third of human milk is set aside for our guests (protection payments?), the relationship between the US Navy and mucus, why no man may be an island, but we may be archipelagos, and vats more. There is serious consideration given to how our relationships with this invisible world evolved:
…animals emerged in a world that had already been teeming with microbes for billions of years. They were the rulers of the planet long before we arrived. And when we did arrive, of course we evolved ways of interacting with the microbes around us. It would be absurd not to, like moving into a new city wearing a blindfold, earplugs, and a muzzle. Besides, microbes weren’t just unavoidable: they were useful. They fed the pioneering animals. Their presence also provided valuable cues to areas rich in nutrients, to temperatures conducive to life, or flat surfaces upon which to settle. By sensing these cues, pioneering animals gained valuable information about the world around them…hints of those ancient interactions still abound today.
 “It all depends.” As if life wasn’t complicated enough. Don’t you just love it when you are looking for help and the person you are asking responds with “It all depends.” And it really does, and it really will. What will be different, though, will be that your caregiver will have a much better idea than most caregivers can possibly have today. They will be able to look at a profile from a type of blood test and match potential solutions to the bacteria living in your gut, or wherever else in your two-legged bacteria condo might pertain. This knowledge is still in its infancy – at least a broad knowledge, but it is coming, and has the potential to make meaningful improvements in our health.
As microbiologist Patrice Cani told me, “The future will be a la carte.”And in this a la carte future, we won’t have to stop at picking the right bacteria for the job. Some scientists are picking the right genes for the job, and combining them into artisanal bacteria. Rather than just recruiting species with the right abilities, they are tinkering with the microbes themselves to endow them with new skills. 
Balance – from Explainxkcd.comThis raises some concerns, although they do not get a lot of attention here. If scientists can develop designer probiota to ameliorate suffering, there will always be evil-doers eager to use new technology to make designer biota intended to act as pathogens. In fact that is pretty much my sole gripe about this book. I wish more space had been devoted to the potential dangers of this advancing treatment modality. Just ask yourself, What would ISIS do?The title of Ed Yong’s book may not be up there with The Selfish Gene, Silent Spring, or Guns, Germs and Steel but what it lacks in snappy-ness it more than makes up for in content.

It made everything really accessible and easy to understand without sacrificing on providing details or explanations. It provides a lot of citations so I can go look up the specific research papers and experiments mentioned that are of most interest to me, which I did. It also just connected research to larger ideas and theories for why things work the way they do. I think the whole point of science and the interest in it has to do with its ability to provide insight and answers into the why of things, at least for me. I also think Yong was really good about explaining the limitations of the research while also making the reader excited about where things could potentially go. Like I think it can be quite hard to straddle that line between talking about the exciting potential of something while also being clear that it might not go anywhere and that there's a lot of complexity and limitation in science. Also he mentioned one of my favorite books of all time, The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life, at the beginning so that automatically made me like the author a lot more. Anyways I really enjoyed this, I know I've been reading a lot of non-fiction so far this year, and this has definitely been one of the best ones so fat this year."
62,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,5,"For my entire hospital career I have worked in oncology, where I have been part of teams taking care of people with cancer. Frequently patients have “neutropenic fevers,” a condition considered to be potentially harmful and almost always requiring admission to the hospital. Neutrophils are those brave little white blood cells that go out into our bodies and do battle with all the nasty things our bodies are exposed to every day. Neutropenia means the patient has none of those cells to speak of (and this is why herd immunity and vaccines are important). We culture blood and urine, scan lungs, treat with antibiotics, and monitor for a few days to see if any microbes grow out in cultures. We teach people to fastidiously handwash, and avoid people who are sick. We make them wear masks in the hallways, in order to filter out airborne viruses. Their rooms have special filtration systems. We encourage them to make safe food choices, avoiding foods that can’t be washed or scrubbed clean, or might be undercooked. And you want to know the kicker? If these patients are infected, it’s usually because of microbes in their own body have run amok and caused infection.You know what else is in the hospital? Microbes. Tons of antibiotic-resistant microbes, hanging out in patient bodies and everywhere else. Once someone is cultured positive for these microbes, they stay on “isolation” for the duration of the visit--and sometimes for life in the case of microbes resistant to all antibiotics--in the (vain) hopes that staff, visitors and patients won’t go moving those resistant microbes around the hospital. A shift where I don’t where a yellow isolation gown to go into these rooms is pretty unusual.Yong made my little grey cells stretch and reach, and now I have yet more ways to think about microbes, and I dearly wish he would re-write this book–maybe in magazine form–every couple years so I can keep up with all the interesting research. Like David Quammen, Yong doesn’t just stick to one branch of research science; he wanders around many fields as he explores the impact microbes have made on us. He’ll first have you thinking about their sheer evolutionary weight (literally and figuratively), reminding us that we evolved in context of a microbe landscape, not the other way round (and some thought apes were a stretch). Like living on a planet where most of the water is saltwater, it makes sense that microbes would impact the evolution of life.Yong walks the reader through some of the science that show how animals evolved to use microbes (and perhaps vice versa?). Some are evolutionary, some genetic, some macro. There’s a lovely experiment where a glowing squid developed a sequestered area for those microbes–can’t set them free in the body, of course, so you have to create a special compartment.In other words, I highly recommend this book. It’s quite well researched and documented, with extensive citations. There’s a bibliography and index, for those that want to delve further or pick and choose. As a further note, I’ll say that I always appreciate researchers/writers who express appreciation for those they interview and follow, without being fawning, and Yong does a nice job with that as well. There are parts I really liked, parts I liked less, parts where someone should have trimmed his descriptive writing just a tad, but any book that keeps me thinking about it months later is a five star read.I’m going to put my detailed book report below page break at my wordpress site ( https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2019/...) with notes heavily on the medical and the ocean science. There’s also some interesting stuff about insects, for those who might lean that way, and trees."
63,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"Inner values get, in this context, wholly new, trillion of dimensions.Like so many prejudices, those against microorganisms are stupid and shortsighted. The first associations are not symbiosis and better health but infection and disease because the negative image is over-represented. Hygiene and health are essential, but the benefits of invisible companions are far too rarely highlighted and the beneficial minis outweigh the pests by far. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms is necessary for good health, built on a microorganism friendly diet.Without a symbiosis with a few pounds of microorganisms that are spread over and through the whole body, human life would not be possible, metabolic processes would stop death would be inevitable. A co-evolution has made all higher living beings dependent on the colonizers because they defend humans against enemy invaders which could harm their host. Of course, they also assist with bodily functions because they bring benefits to them so that the motivation for the defense help is not purely altruistic. They form a second front against attackers and it are often the human eaters themselves who are to blame when they wreck their microflora and lose the second shield because of permanently unhealthy nom nom.The coevolution of higher life with invisible helpers is long and has usually developed into a symbiosis. Much has happened since the first bacterium settled in a higher being while it was itself being altered by a virus etc.The ever more severe human intervention in this cycle has led to problems within less than 75 years. Since the advent of antibiotics and serial mass production of drugs, allergies, food sensitivities, autoimmune diseases, multidrug-resistant germs, lifestyle diseases, etc. are on the rise. How much of this is related to the destruction of the natural balance in the body, can be difficult to estimate due to a lack of studies. A one-sided diet with an excessive intake of antibiotics in addition to various other drugs is an essential factor that turns the symbiosis into a dysbiosis.Many drugs include, as a side effect, a mass extinction combined with a collapse of the miniaturized social order, civil wars and a lengthy reconstruction of it. With medicine and hygiene, much money can be made and as a result, super-pathogens grow in hospitals, while chemical gangs in the body of the patients decimate the defense forces of the body.Therapies with alternative and gentler drugs would be a new competitive and biological disinfectant and more expensive than artificial chemicals in the short term without including long-time costs. The patients pay for this with their health and sometimes life.The potential market with tailor-made probiotics and the manipulation and improvement of microfauna with genetically modified organisms is a future-oriented industry. As soon as enough bucks are made with conventional medicine, the Big Players will enter it. Until then it will be vilified and kept down.Actually the effort, according to the standards of medical economics, would not be responsible. Individualized medicine would have to first check the patients for potential vulnerabilities in their microbiome and then create a tailored therapy for them. A great alternative for rich people, but all others continue to receive the standard procedure of conventional treatment that kills friend and foe alike.If one eats microbe-hostile, one gets problems because a healthy, natural and balanced diet ensures a stable and robust micro-environment. Industrially highly processed and unhealthy food kills many of the little helpers and in their places settle less species-rich constellations, sometimes almost monocultures of dodgy creaturs. These not only damage health in addition to the unhealthy diet but also ensure that the desire for excessive and destructive gluttony with junk food never breaks off in the brain. Their interest in a steady supply is justified. A dietary change to fresh, low-fat, salt-reduced and sugar-free diets could significantly reduce their intake. Everyone has to make a choice themselves. Fit and peaceful armies that have lived and protected us for eons or, alternatively, mercenary junkie armies with dubious loyalty, prone to excesses and arson. One willingly lets them move around in the heartland until one loses control over them or they desert and begin dismantling oneself from within. Many times, a supposed protective power has in retrospect proved to be the worst enemy.The brain partakes at every meal and accordingly, the performance can be expanded or reduced. Not only the body feels sluggish after too much food, but the gray cells are overwhelmed too. It is not so much the energy used in digestion or the inertia that sets in with permanent overeating. Much more the fuel of the brain is of poor quality. In the car or an expensive machine, one would not pour substandard gasoline or cheap oil. This mentality does not apply to one's own body. From one-sided nutrition with inferior food of low quality less valuable substances can be extracted, which would be necessary for optimal brain function. One eats oneself dumb.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiota"
64,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten,5,"”The latest estimates suggest that we have around 30 trillion human cells and 39 trillion microbial ones – a roughly even split. Even these numbers are inexact, but that does not really matter: by any reckoning, we contain multitudes.”“Perhaps it is less that I contain multitudes and more that I am multitudes.”I realized, as I was reading this book, that I have not had antibiotics in over twenty-five years. When I shared that information with my friends, the reactions were anywhere from “Wow” to “that is impossible.” Those reactions indicated to me how overly reliant we have become on antibiotics to fight what we perceive to be bad microbes. Of course, antibiotics are indiscriminate in what they kill. They are definitely a kill-them-all-and-let-Odin-sort-them-out kind of killer. ”But antibiotics are shock-and-awe weapons. They kill the bacteria we want as well as those we don’t – an approach that’s like nuking a city to deal with a rat. We don’t even need to see the rat to begin the massacre: many antibiotics are prescribed needlessly to treat viral infections they have no hope of countering.”I don’t get sick very often, and when I do, I seem to get sick to a lesser extent than do other people who are suffering from the same malady. Lucky genetics or maybe I’ve got a well balanced microbiome. I grew up on a farm and was exposed to a lot of microbes, more than the average person. In fact, one of the problems that is plaguing the first world is the fact that a greater percentage of people are not exposed to animals, a great source of useful microbes, or even just the outdoors, where we encounter microbes, bad and good, that help us format a diverse microbiome. They live in concrete worlds that are beneficial to health in the short term, but bad for health in the long term. They don’t run a gauntlet of infectious diseases that actually make them more resilient to illnesses. Their immune systems lack experience and become jumpy, overreacting to allergies and other minor threats. I think we may discover that microbes hold the key to all of our health issues. Big Brother might be watching us go about our daily lives, but what about the control imposed by the Orwellian, brainless, single-cell organisms inside of us? What we eat may not always be our idea. I’ve always been a bit wary of being manipulated by my own hormones, but what if I’m being manipulated by the microbes in my digestive tract as to what foods I like? ”Different microbes fare better on certain diets. Some are peerless at digesting plant fibres. Others thrive on fats. When you choose your meals, you are also choosing which bacteria get fed, and which get an advantage over their peers. But they don’t have to sit there and graciously await your decision. As we have seen, bacteria have ways of hacking into the nervous system. If they released dopamine, a chemical involved in feelings of pleasure and reward, when you ate the ‘right’ things, could they potentially train you to choose certain foods over others? Do they get a say in your menu picks?”So lean people have different levels of certain microbes in their digestive tract than overweight people. They tend to have a more balanced diet, heavy in veggies and fruits. Wonderful news, right? So to lose weight, all we have to do is take microbes from lean people and put them in overweight people. If only it were that easy. The problem is, those lean, mean producing microbes need to eat, so if the overweight person doesn’t change his diet and feed those microbes what they want to eat, they starve. This is, of course, an oversimplification of all the issues that go into trying to improve or change a microbiome, but the possibilities, with further research, are encouraging. I know we all want the magic pill that doesn’t require us to change our lifestyle or food choices, but what if your food preferences are being dictated by a microbe that has hijacked your nervous system to manipulate you into feeding it what it wants? That to me is sort of like being possessed by a demon. “‘America is a constipated nation,’ he said, indelicately. ‘If you pass small stools, you have big hospitals.’” If I miss a day not passing a bowel movement, I get annoyed. I like it when my intestinal tract is working like a well-oiled machine. I want the outgoing to keep up with the incoming. Nothing makes me feel less healthy than to think of BM hanging out in my intestinal tract any longer than it has to. When my digestive tract is working the way I want it to, it is operating to the theme song of Rawhide.
”Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'RawhideShe rollin', rollin', rollin'Though the streams are swollenKeep them doggies rollin', rawhideThrough rain an' wind an' weatherHellbent for leatherMove 'em on, head 'em upHead 'em up, move 'em onMove 'em on, head 'em upRawhide.”
 We are coming out of an era where we were convinced that any microbe was a bad microbe and finally are starting to embrace the idea that some microbes are not only good for us but essential. We pick up microbes from the people around us, and some of those microbes get added to our microbiome. I was reading this article, titled Your Partner could affect Your Microbiome, about a study conducted on heterosexual couples to see how much influence each had on the other’s microbiome. ”After testing the samples, the researchers noted that microbes had been swapped between couples to a significant enough extent that computer algorithms were able to link a person to their partner with an accuracy of 86 percent.” Makes me wonder about the 14%: so how much interaction do you have with your partner? The next thought, of course, is to think about the fact that your partner also brings with her the microbes received from past partners, and now those microbes have been shared with you. *Shudder* It is probably best not to think about it. I came away from reading this book thinking that microbes might provide solutions to many health issues that have plagued us for generations, such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and autoimmune disorders. Microbes have the ability to adapt and borrow from other microbes and change their makeup and purpose. The possibilities are, therefore, endless for us to find elusive cures hidden right in the microscopic multitudes within us. We have used microbes to dengue-fever proof mosquitoes and to save skin infected frogs from Amphibiageddon. My question is, can we use some of those breakthroughs to save the bees and potentially even the human race? The sky's the limit, and only with the very recent change in mindset about microbes have we begun to explore the potential. We have one great advantage…we know microbes exist! So take care of your microbiome, and start by reading this fascinating book. You will look at the world you can’t see with microscopic eyes.

65,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,0,"Update: Antibiotics and obesity. It is routine in the US (although banned in the UK and Canada) to give cows, pigs, chickens etc low doses of antibiotics in order to fatten them up. No one knows why the antibiotics make them gain weight on the same amount of food, but they do. There is no reason to suppose that we are any different. The mechanism has to do with altering the biome, the microbes in the body, but how long the effect lasts isn't known, it might be a lifetime thing.Antibiotics and resistance. We are told that we are overprescribed antibiotics and that is causing resistance, but the amount of antibiotics any individual gets is absolutely minor compared to the amount that we consume. Not only consume from meat, but since animal droppings are used for fertilizer, perhaps from our bread and vegetables and water too. It reminds me of recycling and the emphasis on all of us individuals doing it. However, 98% of all waste is industrial, retail and from restaurants. Go to many supermarkets and they charge you for a plastic bag (if they even have them), go to a 'green' supermarket like Whole Foods and they give a paper one. Then look at the produce, it's packed in plastic, the meat is in styrofoam, the deli salads in plastic, the knife and fork you got to eat them with are plastic, the coffe cup (recyclable!) has a plastic lid, the bottle of juice is probably plastic but the straw is paper. Plastic is cheap and convenient, clean, easy to store and keeps things fresh. Why change if you can make people feel they are the problem and that you are helping them to do the right thing? It's just clever marketing. They are the 98% of the problem and until they address the issues of pollution and climate change in their own industries and stores, no matter how hard we try, we will only make ... 2% of a difference.____________________Schizophrenia used to be blamed on cold mothers, autism likewise, it was the mother's fault. We've moved on now to proving it is the mother getting flu or measles (why didn't she get vaccinated, oh how could she do this and risk inflicting her child.... dadadada. Oh no she couldnt' get vaccinated because that causes.... dadadada).   ""Patterson had read that pregnant women who incur serious infections, like flu or measles, are more likely to have kids with autism and schizophrenia. He thought that a mother's immune responses might somehow affect the development of her baby's brain. He just didn't know how."".......... ""And they realised that Patterson's mice had gut problems in common with actual autistic children: both were likely to have diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal disorders, and both harboured unusual comunities of gut bicrobes. Perhaps, the duo reasoned, fixing those gut problems might also lead to changes in behaviour."" And so it goes on, these male scientists keen to prove that these links to lab mice proved the mother caused autism in her babies. Until, science writer, a woman, Emily Willingham points out that, 
""Mice don't have autism, which is a human neurobiological construct shaped in part by social and cultural perceptions of what is considered normal. Is a mouse repeatedly burying a marble really like a child rocking back and forth? Is a lower frequency of squeaks the same as being unable to talk to other people? If you squint just so, the similarities jump out . Look again and and you might see parallels with other conditions. 
Then the killer - the lab mice used were originally bred to model schizophrenia. So you have scientists saying that the bacteria in the guts of autistic babies and schizophrenic mice who cannot possibly be bred in any way to be autistic proves that it is the mother is responsible, it's just more time is needed to find the proof, the microbes responsible.It's scientific confirmation bias. It's akin to a scientific conspiracy theory. One way or another the mother must be blamed. And say, as the woman science writer says, that all these gut problems can be seen as not just similarities but absolute parallels to other conditions, not autism ."
66,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40898015-jamie,5,"Well, I will never think of bacteria and archaea the same. I certainly have a newfound understanding of just how vital it is to every part of life. That microbes and bacteria have helped shape our planet for billions of years, down to every single flora and fauna; even all the oxygen we breath has come from bacteria. I also never really thought about the microbes that are constantly around us and even on me, or how many you are ""seeding"" to the world. That""every person aerosolises 37 million bacteria per hour"". And, if that isn't crazy enough, how about ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars"". To me, learning all of this was just simply incredible-the effortless symbiosis of microbes with the environment and with ourselves. I could go on and on about this book-so I will end with is, this is hands down one of my favorite science books. The ""science"" wasn't intimidating to read, as the author didn't assume you were already an expert on the subject. It wasn't dry either, and a few parts made me laugh. This book would be great for anyone who is interested in learning about the unseen world going on all around them. "
67,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a fascinating book about the microbes inside all of us, and inside other animals as well. Now, it is often said that there are ten times as many bacteria in our bodies as there are cells. This, it turns out, is probably an over-estimate; the number of bacteria is probably in the same ballpark as the number of cells. But still, that is a lot!This book goes into detail about the amazing partnerships--the symbioses--between microbes and large organisms, mostly animals and humans. Microbes are essential to digestion, to our immune systems, and many other functions.Every person has his own population of microbes, which can be different between individuals. And we spread our microbes around; every day we deposit 30 million of them by breathing, touching things, and by excretions.Most microbes are not harmful to humans. But the distinction between harmful and not harmful and helpful is not always crystal clear. Microbes in our guts help digestion, but if they escape into the blood stream they can be deadly. I really enjoyed learning how dengue can be prevented by infecting mosquitos with a common bacterium called Wolbachia.I learned all sorts of great things. For example, probiotic foods and supplements have not been proven to be effective. Also, toilets that are cleaned too often are more likely to be covered in bacteria. And, hospital rooms with closed windows contain more deadly microbes than the fresh air outside. Some scientists believe that microbes are responsible for obesity, and even for high blood pressure.This book is actually fun to read, filled with subtle humor, and extremely informative. This book is so well written, I must recommend it to everyone."
68,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84916113-somebunny-reads-phoenix,5,"I am Legion.  So, apparently human beings (and all beings in general) are just bags of bacteria and other microorganisms, and these fascinating fellas have always dominated the Earth, from the birth of life to present days: there are more bacteria in our guts than starts in our galaxy. Interesting, uh? I would say a wonderful topic for a wonderful book! I loved this book and found it extremely interesting for many reasons. First, because it was very well-written, and second because it opened my mind to the fascinating field of microbiology, which I'd never think it would be for interest for me (a linguist). This book literally opened a new door for me, and since starting this read I watched documentaries and collected all kinds of information on bacteria, virus, and microorganisms in general. For example, did you know that our body contains so many bacteria that there are roughly the same amount of human cells and bacteria cells inside it? Or that sponges are such simple animals and yet full of microbes that sometimes, if you look at a sponge under a microscope, you will barely be able to see the animal for the microbes that cover it? Or that there is such a thing as a poop transplant (Faecal Microbiota Transplant, or FMT), in which stool samples from one healthy individual are inserted into someone else's intestines to re-create a healthy microbe environment and thus fighting many digestion-related illnesses? This book was all extremely interesting, and I think it also contains two very important messages to always keep in mind: first (something that many people, but not all people, know), that not all microorganisms are bad, and some of them are not only fundamental to sustain life and normal functions of animals and plants, but can also be used to cure health conditions and preserve the environment. Our indiscriminate war against germs, overdoing with disinfectant and antibiotics, is both straightening bad bacteria and endangering good ones, with repercussions on our and our Planets's health. Second, that this field is one of the most futurist fields of science, and we'll probably see incredible developments in the future: the creation of medicines based on probiotics, bacteria artificially engineered to fight diseases; and, incidentally, we'll probably see a lot of this stuff in sci-fi. Of course, as the author himself points out, scientists always have the ambition to find a grand unified theory, a master equation which can elegantly explain our universe, and microbiology, with its recent discoveries on how our life on the Planet started (seriously, look it up or read about it in this book, it's fascinating), how microorganisms are intertwined with hosts in complex symbiotic relationships which can even affect genome, and how much we could potentially do/cure just using bacteria, is currently one of the most fashionable candidates. Without having to believe that bacteria is the solution to all our problems, from dying crops to saving the coral reef and solve both malnutrition and obesity, let alone eradicating lymphatic filariasis and dengue fever; we instead can and should try to educate ourselves more about the microcosm which thrives inside of us and inside the smallest of bugs, so that we can learn how to respect it and be aware of the danger those small little things can pose to us, but also us to them. Bacteria can get extinct too, and who knows how many good friends we used to have in our guts before we killed them and started getting irritable bowls! Save your friendly neighbour bacterium!!! "
69,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,5,"Though we might lather our skin with antibacterial soap, clean our hands with alcohol sanitizers, gargle with mouthwash, scrub our kitchen surfaces, disinfect our bathrooms, spray Lysol all over the house, take antibiotics, etc., there are - and always will be - microbes everywhere. This is especially true of our warm moist bodies - which are covered inside and out with microorganisms....and this is a good thing.Bacteria are on and in our bodiesIn fact our bodies are really an indivisible aggregate of 'our' tissues and organs....and the microbial world that makes its home there. Moreover this is true for every multicellular organism on Earth. The totality of microorganisms (and their parts) in/on our bodies is called our 'microbiome', and it's composed of myriad kinds of bacteria, viruses, archaea, snippets of microbial DNA, and other miniscule microbial fragments. This microbiome helps digest our food, produces vitamins and minerals, breaks down toxins and dangerous chemicals, guides our embryonic development, assists our immune system, probably influences our behavior, and so on. There are many kinds of microbes in the worldIn this entertaining and illuminating book, Yong touches on the evolution of microbes; the history of microbiology; symbiotic relationships among microbes; symbiosis between microbes and higher organisms; dysbiosis (unbalanced microbiomes that harm their hosts); how scientists study and identify microbiomes; research studies aimed at seeding hospitals and buildings with 'good microbes'; and much more.Symbiotic microbes provide nutrients for plantsHospitals are covered with microorganisms. Seeding hospitals with 'good microbes' might prevent 'bad microbes' from growing.Most people probably associate microbes with disease, and Yong provides some examples of pathogenic organisms. The vast majority of microbes are beneficial though, and I was fascinated to read about their varied roles in the world of living things. I've had a rather varied career and in a galaxy far away and long ago I got a degree in microbiology.....but this book has a lot of new and exciting information. I'll give examples of a few intriguing factoids gleaned from the book:1. We can improve our health by nurturing 'helpful' bacteria in our digestive system. Since fiber-loving bacteria are supposed to boost the immune system I added a LOT of fiber to my diet.....and I think I feel healthier already!! We need 'good microbes' in our stomach 2. Newborns are bathed in good microbes during vaginal delivery. Thus, infants born by caesarean section - lacking this initial 'seeding' - develop different microbiomes than vaginal babies. Breast-feeding also provides babies with an initial dose of beneficial microbes. 3. It's good for kids to have a dog because the pooch brings outdoor microbes into the home. Being exposed to a larger variety of microorganisms reduces the likelihood of getting allergies. 4. The author, Ed Yong, really likes the Hawaiian bobtail squid, which contains large colonies of luminous bacteria. Whenever Yong mentions this critter he calls it 'adorable.' (ha ha ha)Bacteria make squids luminous This tome covers a fascinating array of topics in an understandable - and sometimes humorous - fashion. I love this book and would recommend it to everyone.

70,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"Recently I've been hearing reports of miracle cures of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by use of fecal matter transplants. Also I've heard that some autoimmune diseases may be caused by environments that are too clean. Upon hearing these things the question that comes to my mind is, why this new found enthusiasm for microorganisms? We've known about bacteria since Louis Pasteur. So why all this new information about microbes as if it was something new? (Actually we learn in this book that Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered the prevalence of bacteria on all sorts of surfaces in the 1680s, but for unexplained reasons his findings were pretty much ignored for 200 years.) What I learned from this book is that the new technologies of gene sequencing and genomics has changed everything. Before gene sequencing careful study of microbes was limited to those that could be grown on a culture medium. With current tools it is possible to sequence every single gene in a sample from a skin flake, stream bed, or any environmental or body surface. Suddenly researchers were able to provide detailed descriptions of myriad microbiota (This book uses the term microbiome.)What scientists are learning is that the number, variety and prevalence of microorganisms exceeded all expectations. Combined with our understanding of evolution we now know that all of life has co-evolved within close contact with microbes. Consequently many functions of animal life are either dependent on, or aided and regulated by, microorganisms. Food digestion is a leading example of this. This book warns that current science is in the early phases of understanding microbiomes and that we shouldn't become too excited about spectacular claims made by probiotic manufacturers. However, I believe that the wording used by this book in some cases hypes things a bit too much. In particular I'm don't like the way this book makes the statement that, ""The majority of cells in our body are not human, they're microbes."" Technically that statement is true, but it is misleading. The statement is true regarding the number of cells, but not mass (i.e. weight). Only about 1 to 3 percent of the human body weight is from microbes located mostly in the gut. The reason for this disparity between mass and numbers of cells is that most human cells (e.g. muscle, fat, & blood cells) are larger and more massive than bacterial cells. The information I've explained above about the mass of human cells and bacterial cells is not explained in this book. The book simply makes the statement regarding the number of cells which I'm sure will lead some people to make the declarative statement, ""Did you know that most of the human body is made of bugs?""The book explains why we should think of bacteria and viruses as companions, not enemies. Our efforts at being antibacterial—killing all microbial growth—can sometimes provide an environment in which pathogens can proliferate. But there is one quotation in the book by a doctor that provided another perspective to consider. ""I've never seen anybody die from getting antibiotics, but I've seen some die from the lack of them.""Also, our immune system evolved in an environment of mild background contamination. Thus, our modern clean living environments may be a contributor to increased occurrences of some autoimmune ailments. But of course we all know that contaminated environments can cause disease. Perhaps, as we learn more about microbiomes we'll learn to get the level of contamination just right. This book provides a good overall discussion of the expanding knowledge and understanding of microbes.The following is a link to an excerpt from the book about ""when Leeuwenhoek discovered Microorganisms:http://www.delanceyplace.com/view-arc..."
71,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"I liked this book so I am giving it three stars. It is common knowledge today that everything and all of us are covered with microbes - that some are good and some are bad. Their number can be debated. We have in the past been fixated on getting rid of them. This has been to our detriment. It is clear we have gone too far. Antibiotics are good and necessary, but at the same time they must be used with care. In heedlessly wiping out microbes, we have created an environment where pathogens proliferate. This book is about the symbiosis we have with the microbes living on and in our bodies and in our environment. It is about our need to develop a harmonious relationship between us and them. The book begins with a rather long introduction. I wanted the book to get going; what we were being told was all too general. The introduction is followed by a chapter which focuses on the history of bacteriology, beginning with the Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's (1632 - 1723) development of the microscope. He was the first to observe and describe single celled organisms. The growth of microbiology is reviewed through a discussion of the discoveries of scientists such as Louis Pasteur, Élie Metchnikoff, Theodor Rosebury, René Dubos and others. Microbiologists one has heard of and others less well-known. After the historical review, the remainder of the book contains fascinating information on more contemporary studies, but there is no real structure to the presentation. First of all, the titles of the chapters do not clearly indicate what the chapter will be about. Here are four titles so you can see what I mean:-The Long Waltz-Mutually Assured Success-Allegro in E Major -Microbes à la CarteOn completion of a chapter I had learned a smattering of information, all of which I had found interesting, but what exactly that particular chapter was focused upon most often eluded me. Topics brought up in one chapter come up again in another. For me, when reading a non-fiction book on a topic where my own knowledge is weak, I need structure. There is a heavy use of acronyms and scientific abbreviations, which are explained once, but most often just once. The same is true of the scientific terms used for particular experimental procedures, chemical compounds and pathogens. You can read this book without in-depth previous knowledge, but the more you know before you pick it up the easier it will be to understand. It definitely helped me to have recently read The Gene: An Intimate History. Today scientists are sequencing the genes of the microbes around us. Bacteria readily swap genes, something which humans do not do, but our cells can integrate foreign genetic material from bacteria. It is important to stress that we are today only beginning to understand the symbiotic relationship between our cells and the microbes living in, on and around us. This book does not give definitive answers but indicates where the future may take us. Numerous studies are cited. Here follow examples of topics discussed - fecal transplants, probiotics, studies on the bacteria feeding sugars in breast milk, the beneficial qualities of vaginal microbes for babies’ health and gut microbes in preventing obesity and autoimmune diseases, the value of dogs in increasing the microbe diversity in our homes, the decimation of coral reefs, squid with luminous bacteria. The topics are many and not only about humans, but other flora and fauna too. The book provides a lot of really interesting information, but I wanted a better structure to it all.The audiobook is very well narrated by Charlie Anson. Clear and easy to follow. The narration I have given four stars."

""Every time we touch an object, we leave a microbial imprint upon it. Every time we walk, talk, scratch, shuffle, or sneeze, we cast a personalised cloud of microbes into space. Every person aerosolises around 37 million bacteria per hour. This means that our microbiome isn't confined to our bodies. It perpetually reaches out into our environment."""

74,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated all the information in this book. Might change how you look at yourself, think of yourself and the world around you."

76,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Yong explores the microbiome, not just in humans but in many creatures. He reveals the amazing variety of ways that microorganisms influence their multicellular counterparts. A properly balanced microbiome is not only critical to health, but can be essential to proper development, reproduction and survival. In essence we are one system with the many trillions of foreign organisms in our bodies. We rely on each other. Not that there is a clear cut line between beneficial and pathogenic, a single organism can be both depending on the circumstances. As Yong notes, the immune system is not just a defense against disease causing organisms, it is a manager of our microbiome, ideally operating to maximize its benefits and minimize its dangers.Yong offers numerous examples of the codependence of microbes and animals including humans. One example we can easily relate to concerns a mother’s milk. In human milk there are sugars called human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), over 200 different ones, yet infants are not able to digest them. However, there is a bacteria that eats it all up, Bifidobacterium longum infantis. In return it feeds short-chain fatty acids to the gut cells. B. infantis also helps these cells generate an adhesive to fill gaps between them and it promotes the cells’ manufacture of anti-inflammatory compounds. Not only that, B. infantis helps infant brains grow by producing the sialic acid they need. And there is more. B. infantis attracts some pathogens acting as a decoy preventing them from invading gut cells. This microbe earns its keep.We are familiar with the term symbiosis which applies to the relationship between the microbiome and humans. Endosymbiosis is a more exact description of that relationship since the microbes live in and on us. Yong uses the term dysbiosis to describe when that relationship goes awry, when there is a loss of balance between the microbiome and the immune system. Such an imbalance can contribute to illness and conditions such as nutritional deficiency, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, and many, many more. Unfortunately pinning down the exact constituents of the microbiome responsible is very difficult. Typically there is not one bad actor, but varying mixes of microbes that cause trouble and then only in people with particular genetics or circumstances. Think of your body as an ecosystem. One piece may go astray, but real trouble doesn’t show up until many pieces have been affected, making it exceedingly problematic to understand how the imbalance begins.Biologist Lynn Margulis, persevering in the face of intense criticism, became famous for making the evolutionary role of endosymbiosis credible. Today it is a widely accepted explanation for the mitochondria in our cells which came from a captured bacterium. She also came up with the word holobiant to describe a community of species that stay together throughout their lives including us and our microbiome. This concept can also be applied to genes. Biologists such as Richard Dawkins consider animals and other life forms to be vehicles for genes. Evolution operates to select genes. Their vehicles can change as needed. The genes in our microbiome directly influence our well-being and behavior. Shouldn’t they be considered a part of the set of genes being selected for in our evolution? In other words, the genes of the holobiant together determine the evolutionary vehicle. Consider the example Yong offers of two “species” of closely related flies. They were thought to be separate species. They never mated and they contained different microbiomes. But give them antibiotics and they will successfully mate. Microbes can change an animal’s smell and other factors that can determine mating preference. Eventually these two fly communities with different microbiomes will become distinct species if they never mate. Just as with these flies, it is our hologenome that may be deciding our future.Yong explores the therapeutic potential of changing our microbiome. We make a stab at this today with prebiotics, probiotics and fecal transplants. But to reliably tackle most conditions will require cocktails of bacteria properly proportioned to individual needs. These would require testing for efficacy and safety as would any medicine. We also need to think carefully about how antibiotics and antimicrobials affect the microbiome and the bacteria we encounter. As we begin the age of gene therapy, we can consider not only manipulating the bacteria in our microbiomes but their genes as well. Microbes can be much more easily engineered with genes than can animal cells. Bacteria exchange genes through horizontal transfer. They don’t have to inherit them but can readily pick them up from their neighbors. Thus genes from transient bacteria can get into your microbiome. Astounding, however, is the increasing evidence of bacterial gene horizontal transfer into animal cells. This is particularly true of insects which often have very intimate relationships with bacteria. How this happens needs to be explored. Throughout the book Yong relates example after example of the codependence of animals and bacteria. Bacteria can shape organ development, not only determine sex but change sex after it is established, stop or enable reproduction, stop or enable parasites, provide or block essential nutrients, eradicate or promote a species, decimate or protect a crop, alter the environment and much, much more. Yong makes the case that we need to consider our relationship with bacteria particularly our hologenome if we are to understand our health, our behavior and our future. We are at the beginning of a new appreciation of the role bacteria play in the world, what it means to be human, and new approaches to tackle disease as well as shape our minds and bodies."
77,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49847688-emily,5,"A NEW NONFICTION FAVORITE!!! I'M SO HAPPY.This is absolutely fabulous scientific nonfiction. I think at times, scienctific nonfiction swings one of two ways--over simplified, or overly pendantic. This book truly hit the sweet spot. It's accessible, gorgeously written, and incredibly informative and well-researched.In particular, I liked that Yong doesn't shy away from differing schools of thought. Microbiology as we know it today is still a relatively new science, and as such there are a LOT of different opinions. Yong engages with all of the these. The level of nuance within this book is astounding, and truly elevates it.I also REALLY appreciated that Yong doesn't assume you miraculously remembered every detail from earlier chapters. He would repeat meanings behind acronyms, descriptions of bacteria and cell functions, and a whole lot of other things. However, this never feels repetitive. He's succinct, but also recognizes that his readers might, by chapter 8, forget a line or two from chapter 1. I definitely recommend this!"
78,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50066399-diane-in-australia,4,"I did enjoy this book, but it didn't 'wow' me as much as some of the other reviewers. In fact, I started it awhile ago, and just got distracted by other books, and put it down ... which never happens, if I'm enthralled by a book. When I finally came back to it, I did learn a few things, and read a few things aloud to hubby, so, all-in-all I suppose it was a 'good read'.4 Stars = Outstanding. It definitely held my interest."
79,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17746077-joshua-buhs,4,"A fascinating topic poorly served by the conventions of popular science writing.Ed Yong's book is about microbes--bacteria, mostly, but also viruses and few other extremely small creatures--and how they live with other organisms--humans for the most part, with plenty of other animals, too, though no plants.It has Darwinian ambitions, announced in its subtitle: ""A Grander View of Life"" evokes Darwin's famous phrase closing the first edition of ""On the Origin of Species"": ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.""And it is there in the basic organizing principle of the book. Darwin followed the recommendation of the philosopher of science William Whewell that a good scientific theory account for a range of facts--he called this the ""consilience of induction."" Yong is out to conciliate some inducting, too--so to speak--setting out a view of the interactions between animals and microbes that is extensive.For the past one hundred and fifty or so years, microbes have been mostly seen in the light of germ theory: that is, they have been either classed ad pathological or of little interest. In the last four decades (or so), a new view has taken shape: that microbes are neither good nor bad. But they are ubiquitous. And they are *integral* to multicellular life. Some are pathological. Some perform vital functions. They form an entire ecosystem, one upon which life depends, but one that has been mostly ignored, mostly invisible.As I say, this is a great story, with very important repercussions. The details are fascinating, and Yong is great at explaining the complex interplay between microbes and multicellular organisms in easy to understand ways--that usually do not feel condescending. (I could've used a little less forced humor: de gustibus and all that, though.) Just dipping into the various chapters and reading the sections involves one in some remarkable bits of biology. The book, on the level of the sections, is genuinely fun.There are, of course, important sequelae to this line of thought. One set concerns how we are to live in the world when we know its expanded dimension. Food choices, medicine choices, standard questions about environmental protection--all become more complicated when we have to take microbiology into account. This ""grander view"" of life also calls into question traditional boundaries--between the self and the environment, between humans and other organisms. If bacteria help to build your immune system, what does that mean for ideas about the integrity of the body? If moods and behaviors are effected by gut flora, what does that mean about human will and determinism?Darwin's book was arranged unusually--though brilliantly, in its way. (Waiting twenty years to publish gives certain advantages!) He started with artificial selection, as something most people would understand. Then, in the next two chapters, showed how the elements of artificial selection were inherent in nature, too: one chapter explored natural variety, the other natural competition. Chapter four then tied these various strands together, showing how natural selection worked in nature as an analogue of artificial selection. The remainder of the book--to simplify matters--gathers together a host of facts that can all be explained by natural selection, from the geological record to what we would now call genetics.Yong's book does not work quite so well on the level of chapters. It's fine, but not quite as elegant. There are basically three introductory chapters: one is a prologue, which situates Yong at a zoo watching a scientist investigate the microbial flora on the body of a pangolin. He then moves to another introductory chapter which sets out some guidelines, though these are not consistently used through the book to justify their presence here. He notes that humans are, in effect, islands, homes to vast swarms of bacteria, which can be characterized as neither good nor bad, but as essential to life as we know it. He also introduces the idea that geological time is very long--he's definitely influenced by Darwin and evolutionary biologists, and wants to root the book in its tropes, though they are not really necessary.The second body chapter then introduces us to the idea that various people have looked at microbes over the centuries, to differing ends. He starts with Leeuwenhoek, who was probably the first human to see microbes. But his research into bacteria and similar creatures was never really transformative. He then jumps to the nineteenth century when Pasteur and Koch and the rest put germ theory in place. This was the beginning of what remains the dominant way of looking at microbes.The rest of the chapter then introduces us to the more recent view, which he dates back to the late 1960s with the discovery of a whole new branch of life, the archaebacteria, and then expands to the surveys of microbial life that took off after that. There's a sense that microbiology of the 197os was a lot like American vertebrate biology of the 1900s-1920s, with intensive surveys to characterize most of the major groups and define their geological distribution.This is also the section when Yong could have made a stake for a particular kind of order to the rest of the book, but opted against it. Given that there is a generational element to the story, Yong could have characterized the various schools of microbiology that took shape during this time and given an overview of the people who were involved. Something like what William Leach did with ""The Butterfly People."" If nothing else, it would have helped to make sense of the on-coming chapters, with its huge cast of characters, some recurring, some connected, but the network never quite clear.Instead, what he wants to do is offer a history of ideas--which could work. That's what Darwin did, after all, showing the various ideas that fall under the overarching umbrella, and how they connect. And it is possible to see this, though it is never quite laid out clearly. Part of that is because, for all the introductory matter, the book is never introduced in any but the most general terms. Part of the reason is because the chapter titles are jokey, and so not quite explanatory.Here, though, is a précis of the argument. (It's worth noting that Darwin had expanded chapter explanations in his table of contents, effectively working as a rudimentary index.)Chapter 3. Microbes help build body. Vital functions have been outsourced because microbes are so ubiquitous.Chapter 4. Reintroduces the idea that microbes are neither inherently good nor bad, and even pathological effects can result from certain conditions--in the same way that landscapes can support different kinds of living communities, depending upon their conditions.Chapter 5. Sickness, in people, other organisms, and entire ecosystems, can result from disruptions in the microbial flora. Chapter 6. Animals and their microbes co-evolved.Chapter 7. Because microbes can do so many functions, their coming together with certain organisms allows those organisms to expand into new niches relatively easily. Chapter 8. Genes can be transferred horizontally, from organism to organism.Chapters 9 and 10. The future, and the possibility of microbial engineering.The real reason, though, that it is so difficult to parse out the overall narrative arc is that Yong is in love with the smaller-scale stories. He has been a blogger and writer of magazine articles for many years now, and this experience shows here--to the detriment of the book, I think. With the exception of a few, the chapters do not really lay out a cohesive arguments, but are divided by stories. Again and again, just as Yong is building up to a point, he will take a break and start a new story--with new characters and new creatures.In short, the ideas that are supposed to be driving the story are pushed aside for the story of people. And in the end, the narrative falls between two stools, neither fully the laying out of an idea, nor a group biography, but something in between, and fractured.Apart from making it hard to develop much momentum and to see the forest for the trees, this fragmenting of the book ends up bringing up a whole host of questions that Yong can never really address. Does it matter that one researcher is far from home when she meets with him? Why is another's son hitting Yong in the rear end? Does it matter when World War II was? Talk about conditions leading to (or foreclosing) disease ties into alternative notions of medicine--how does this change in view of microbes relate? Why do Westerners live in an environment that promotes inflammation? Aren't there neo-colonialist concerns with researchers sampling poop from malnourished children? What are the implications of engineering the microbial flora--haven't we learned from big ecological engineering projects?Popular science writing likes to emphasize the humans involved in the science, the work they do, the ideas they have, their personalities and quirks. I get it. But I think the tendency makes it harder to see what Yong is trying to say here. The book is not equipped to answer these questions, and the stories tend to obscure Yong's Darwinian ambitions.Still, he makes some valuable caveats and interventions. As anyone who only half pays attention to debates over nutrition will know, microbes are a big deal--probiotics make lots of money, people are all into feeding the right bugs, and one part of the whole fascination over gluten-free diets is concerns over leaky guts and microbes slipping into the bloodstream. Yong shows how limited the evidence for this talk is, though--particularly probiotics--and as soon as someone starts telling you the exact composition of microbe you need, you should be very wary.And, really, the stories are still fascinating. This last part is what most reviewers I've noticed have focused on, and they are not wrong. Yong got gold of a great subject, and hunted down a huge number of really interesting stories that fit the project. The amount of work that went into the book must have been immense.And, really, when you think of all those accomplishments, it seems churlish to complain that Yong wasn't Darwin also."

Inside our bodies and in our cells, we have even more interesting little microscopic monsters. Plus, we share these little bugs with everyone we meet, especially the people we live with. If you have a dog, the volume of bacteria in your home increases exponentially. If, gentle reader, you are now scratching and twitching, may I suggest getting a copy of 'I Contain Multitudes' so at least you will know how bacteria function, and why we have them in us, on us, and everywhere else. Author Ed Yong writes for the general reader, explaining that the majority of bacteria are helpful. Good thing, eh? My skin is still crawling. Literally. Anybody else feel like hitting the shower for a good scrub?Author Ed Yong humorously explores the microbiological universe we live in. Several chapters explain that bacteria were the first forms of life on Earth, at least as far as we know, by describing the historical record scientists have sussed out through DNA research. He delves into how some of the more interesting bacteria were discovered, and how scientists are currently exploring how bacteria can be used to improve health. Reader, it is obvious after finishing this book being a hypochondriac is an exercise in futility. If it makes you feel any better, most bacteria are our friends. The Earth would be just rock, water and gas fumes without 'em. So. Learn to love your little invisible pets. They certainly love you. You truly are never alone.'I Contain Multitudes' has an extensive Bibliography and an Index. I read the Kindle ebook, which collected the included photos in the back."
81,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"This book is jam-packed with tons of information about the recently uncovered world of microbes. Considering how many books about microbes are popping up, I was skeptical at first, but it quickly became apparent that this book was based on nothing but the best science available on the subject. Just like the Sonnenburgs' book Gut, I contain Multitudes focused on what we know about microbes and was very clear about the lack of evidence when speculating. The researchers cited by Yong are the best in their field. Who Yong *does not cite* is very telling. If you look for an author in Yong's citations (or in the Sonneburgs' citations) and that author is not there, do not trust their book at face value. You will notice that not one reputable microbe researcher and/or book author cites Grain Brain's Perlmutter, whose entire book is made up of misconceptions, sensational claims, and pseudoscience. Some of the most interesting parts of this book include: - Yong's very favorite microbe, Wolbachia, is a fairly magical creature. It is too big to fit into sperm and be passed down through the generations. It can only be carried in eggs. So what is Wolbachia to do if it wants to survive and pass down its genes? Well, it must ensure that as many females as possible survive to carry on its line. Accordingly, it controls the sex of many species as possible (especially arthropods). It either kills the males or alters them in some way to help itself spread through the population. Wolbachia stop female wasps from mating with males. When infected with Wolbachia, the females choose to clone instead. But, if you give the females an antibiotic to wipe out Wolbachia, they begin having sex with males again.In woodlice, Wolbachia interfere with the production of male hormones, ensuring that all woodlice are female or that male woodlice transformed into females. In Blue Moon butterflies Wolbachia kill male embryos, resulting in females outnumbering males by 100 to 1.In other species still, Wolbachia alter sperm in males so that they can only fertilize eggs infected with Wolbachia. (brilliant)Wolbachia is insanely successful, with infections rates often at 100% of the population. The majority of living creatures are arthropods, and 40% of arthropods are infected.- Once it was thought that no microbes could survive conditions at deep ocean vents. However, researchers found myriad forms of life at the vents. There is a worm that has no mouth or anus. To take in nutrients and expel waste products, these worms use the microbes that fill up their bodies. The microbes turn sulfur into the energy (what amazing alchemists!) that maintain the life of the worms, who live without the direct energy of sunlight. - Breastmilk is not for babies. It is to feed the microbes inside babies that are essential for baby's wellbeing and feed the viruses inside babies (the very viruses that make baby sick). - There are no good or bad microbes (this part was simply fantastic). In one species a microbe can be helpful and ""bad"" in another species who it harms. Even in the same individual, microbes are not good or bad. For example, gut bacteria is great.... in the gut. But if it travels to the blood, you have sepsis and die. The bacteria that caused the sepsis isn't ""bad."" It is simply in the wrong place to do its job. When in the blood, it does the same job it does in the intestine, but that is good for the functioning of the gut (and the parts of the body governed by gut microbes) is bad for the bloodstream. Sprinkled throughout the book was the message that, in nature, moderation is key. When is it good to wipe out all microbes? When is it not? How can we know what types of microbes (and at what concentration) are good for which circumstances. - Herbivores have the highest diversity of gut microbes, omnivores had second highest, and carnivores the lowest. Why should this be? Shouldn't animals that eat both plants and animals have more diverse microbes than an animal that only eats plants? Animals that eat only plants need the greatest variety of microbes because it takes tons of enzymes to break down plants but not nearly as much to break down animals. Plants have lot of cellulose and carbs, which are hard to break down. So plant eaters need microbes in great diversity and abundance to accomplish that task.It's funny, but you can think of herbivores as actual mouths. They do the eating of the plant. Their superior microbes break down the plants (just as a mouth and teeth break down food so you can swallow and digest it). Another animal, an omnivore or carnivore, comes along and eats what has essentially already been chewed and broken down. When the omnivore or carnivore eat the herbivore, they have saved themselves the work of breaking down the food. It's done for them. They merely chew it up some more to break it into small enough pieces so their intestine, which has far fewer microbes, can relax and just finish the job of digesting the plants (which hold the sun's energy!) that the herbivore and its microbes already did the hard work of breaking down. Yong gave many excellent examples of various strategies different animals species used for helping guts and microbes work in tandem to digest food. "
82,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"You may think that we are just made from muscles, blood cells, bones and a fair bit of DNA, but in between the gaps are microbes. Billions and billions of them. There are the odd rogue ones, but most of them are useful and make up an essential element of our being. Without them we could not live. They help us in countless ways, sculpting our organs, protecting us from disease and feeding and nourishing us; our gut contains a complete ecosystem that ensure that we extract all the energy we need.Microbes work equal miracles in other animals too, providing the ethereal light that disguises a squid as they hunt, ensuring that koalas are able to digest the unpalatable eucalyptus leaves and the weevil that uses bacteria to make its shell before killing them. The modern worldview of eliminating all microbes is causing as much harm as it is good; people nowdays have a revulsion of all things bacterial, hence the raft of cleaning products that are designed to scour all surfaces and hands clean of these unwanted intruders. However, as Yong successfully argues in this book that not only we might be missing a trick, but our bacterial ecosystem is essential for our survival. A good example of this is in hospitals; the modern view is that all windows have to be locked shut to keep rogue microbes out, but the effect of this is that patients sit in their beds stewing in a lethal mix of micro-organisms. This hazardous situation can be simply solved by opening a window, this allows the dispersal and dilution of the potentially lethal ones. Simple, but very effective.It is a fascinating account of the unseen creatures that live within and all around us. Yong takes us on this journey through the microscope to discover the most recent research from scientists all round the world and tell us of the secrets that are being discovered about microbes. Some of the treatments being developed have the potential to make people’s so lives much better; one example is RePOOpulate – as unappealing as it sounds! However, this treatment has worked miracles with a 94% success rate and no side effects, a success rate not seen in many other cures. Yong writes with an engaging and eloquent style and makes the science in here really accessible. Well worth reading. 4.5 stars."
83,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"Ed Yong is a London-based science writer for The Atlantic and is part of National Geographic’s blogging network. I had trouble believing that I Contain Multitudes is his first book; it’s so fluent and engaging that it immediately draws you into the microbial world and keeps you marveling at its strange yet fascinating workings. Yong writes like a journalist rather than a scientist, and that’s a good thing: with an eye to the average reader, he uses a variety of examples and metaphors, intersperses personal anecdotes of visiting researchers at their labs or in the field, and is careful to recap important facts in a lucid way.The book opens with a visit to San Diego Zoo (see the exclusive extract following my review), where we meet Baba the pangolin. But “Baba is not just a pangolin. He is also a teeming mass of microbes,” Yong explains. “Some of them live inside him, mostly in his gut. Others live on the surface of his face, belly, paws, claws, and scales.” Believe it or not, but we are roughly half and half human cells and microbial cells, making each of us – like all creatures – more of an ecosystem (another term is “holobiont”) than a single entity.Microbes vary between species but also within species, so each individual’s microbiome in some ways reflects a unique mixture of genes and experiences. This is why people’s underarms smell subtly different, and how hyenas use their scent glands to convey messages. The microbiome may well be tailored to different creatures’ functions, so researchers at San Diego Zoo are testing swabs from their animals to see if there could be discernible signatures for burrowing or flying activities, or for disease. I was struck by the breadth of species considered here: not just mammals, but also invertebrates like beetles, cicadas, and squid – my entomologist husband would surely be proud. The “Us” in the subtitle is thus used very inclusively to speak of the way that microbes live in symbiosis with all living things.If I were to boil down Yong’s book to one message, it’s that microbes are not simply “bad” or “good” but have different roles depending on the context and the host. You can hardly dismiss all bacteria as germs that must be eradicated when there are thousands of benign species in your gut (versus fewer than 100 kinds that cause infectious diseases). If it weren’t for the microbes passed on to us at birth, we wouldn’t be able to digest the complex sugars in our mothers’ milk. Other creatures rely on bacteria to help them develop to adulthood, like the tube worms that thrive on Navy ship hulls at Pearl Harbor.Yet Yong feels too little attention is given to beneficial microbes, and in many cases we continue the campaign to rid ourselves of them through overuse of antibiotics and taking cleanliness to unhelpful extremes. “We have been tilting at microbes for too long, and created a world that’s hostile to the ones we need,” he asserts.The book is full of lines like that one that combine a nice turn of phrase and a clever literary allusion. In the title alone, after all, you have references to Walt Whitman (“I contain multitudes” is from his “Song of Myself”) and Charles Darwin (“there is grandeur in this view of life” is part of the closing sentence in his On the Origin of Species). Yong also sets up helpful analogies, comparing the immune system to a thermostat and antibiotics to “shock-and-awe weapons … like nuking a city to deal with a rat.”History and future are also brought together very effectively, with the narrative looking backwards to Leeuwenhoek’s early microscope work and Pasteur and Koch’s germ theory, but also forwards to the prospects that current research into microbes might enable: eliminating elephantiasis, protecting frogs from deadly fungi via probiotics in the soil, fecal microbiota transplants to cure C. diff infections, and so on.The possibilities seem endless, and this is a book that will keep you shaking your head in amazement. I’d liken Yong’s style to David Quammen’s or Rebecca Skloot’s. His clear and intriguing science writing succeeds in inspiring wonder at the natural world and at the bodies that carry us through it.I participated in the official Wellcome Book Prize 2017 blog tour. See my blog review at Bookish Beck for an exclusive extract from the book."
84,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"I Contain Multitudes is science writing at its best: Ed Yong is curious and energetic, and his enthusiasm for bacteria (and wordplay) runneth over in this wide-ranging look at microbiomes within and without. The Whitman-inspired title is apt: we drift through a world teeming with bacteria. Our nonhuman bacterial denizens number in the trillions, and like Pigpen from Peanuts we exude a cloud of our own making, aerosolizing some 37 million bacteria per hour. Yong is quick to dispel the oft-cited back-of-the-napkin calculation that bacterial cells outnumber human cells 10-to-1. The best recent estimates render that split more evenly: roughly 39 trillion microbial cells to 30 trillion [significantly larger] human cells. Still, the point remains that we are hybrid creatures. If there is one takeaway message, it is that bacteria have gotten a bad rap due to our fixation on pathogens. Fewer than 100 bacterial species cause infectious disease in humans, compared to thousands of species [in our guts alone] that range from harmless to essential. If bacteria were to suddenly disappear, life would come to a quick and crashing halt. We need bacteria to digest, to supplement nutrients, to fight infection, and to offload hosts of other responsibilities we are evolved to depend upon.While the book is chock full of interesting factoids (your right hand shares just a sixth of its microbial species with your left hand!) and canvasses the history of human discovery of the microscopic world, most information comes in the form of Yong's interactions with researchers. We learn about connections between bacteria and immunity, and potential developmental connections to autism and schizophrenia. We look at the ever-raging battle between farmers and parasites, and how bacteria can be wielded by aggressor and defender alike. There's a lot of information on the bacteria we inherit from our mothers as we pass through the birth canal, as well as the purpose of milk for a developing child (it feeds important bacteria as well as the baby). We witness tests with bacteria-free mice, swabbed zoo animals, gene sequencing, computer simulations, and various other methods of isolating the causes and effects of bacterial strains. We learn about commercial products that do and do not help (for example, probiotics make sense in theory, but the popular brands do either nothing at all or very little). We are shown the dangerous effects of overusing antibacterial products (themselves bi-products of bacterial warfare) and our misguided attempts to sanitize our environments [read: hospitals] completely. We learn the power of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to both explain much of evolutionary history, to blur the lines between species and genomes, and to give us a potential leg up against parasites. Yong chronicles some successful examples of engineering (such as infecting mosquitos with neutral Wolbachia to combat Dengue fever, or applying transplanted rumen to help Austalian livestock eat Leucaena without consequence), but also some of the ongoing problems like pine beetle forest destruction. We hold our noses while applauding the remarkable promise of fecal transplantation, especially for C-diff, and the ongoing work to address other conditions like IBS and colitis.Yong shares leading theories, discredited theories, promising research, ongoing debates, and a lot of the nuance you don't always get from popular science writing. He's a gifted communicator, and can't resist side commentary with a lot of juicy science and good sense. With each discovery, it becomes readily apparent that we've barely scratched the surface and that quick assumptions and preliminary results almost always mislead, giving way to deeper understanding with ongoing research. Further investigation into the bacterial world will result in exciting advancements in health, materials, food, and a variety of other fields. I hope many people read this and are inspired to join in on the discovery."

86,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32913415-laura,5," When Orson Welles said ""We're born alone, we live alone, we die alone"", he was mistaken. Even when we are alone, we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis--a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. Some animals are colonized by microbes while they are still unfertilized eggs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then proceed through our lives in their presence. When we eat, so do they. When we travel, they come along. When we die, they consume us. Every one of us is a zoo in our own right--a colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collective. An entire world. ~~microscopic view of bacteria on the human tongueEd Yong takes us into an absolutely fascinating world--the unseen world of microscopic life. These tiny life forms were first glimpsed by a Dutchman, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, who thought to look at a drop of water through his handmade lens in the 1660's. He went on to publish detailed drawings of his findings. They garnered him intense attention and fame, and he went on to become a Fellow of the Royal Society. However, he never taught anyone else how to make his superior lenses, and when he died...and his collection went missing...interest waned. But then came the late 1700's and Louis Pasteur. He, along with Robert Koch, did meticulous work showing that bacteria are responsible for diseases formerly attributed to ""bad air"". So microbes permanently entered the lime light, but have been cast, almost exclusively, as a villein. ""It didn't help that just before this wave of discoveries, in 1859, one Charles Darwin had published  On the Origin of Species . 'Through this historical accident, the germ theory of disease developed during the gory phase of Darwinism, where the interplay between living things was regarded as a struggle for survival, when one had to be friend or foe, with no quarter given,' wrote microbiologist Rene Dubos. 'This attitude molded, from the beginning, all later attempts to control microbial diseases. It led to a kind of aggressive warfare against the microbes, aimed at their elimination from the sick individual and the community."" I am, as a registered nurse, a product of this culture. We in modern medicine are proud of the largely successful warfare that we have waged against infectious disease. We've come a VERY long ways from the days in which surgeons, covered in gore, wiped their saw on their apron, and then moved on to their next victim/patient. We maintain meticulous sterile fields. We ""foam in/foam out"" to kill all microbes on our hands before touching patients. We autoclave equipment and sanitize hospital rooms. We prescribe antibiotics for true bacterial infections...and many infections that don't require these weapons. In short, we've solved giant disease and pestilence problems, prolonging human life by decades in the process, but created other issues. We're only now acknowledging the seriousness of these new issues, and the science behind why eradicating bacteria might not be such a good idea.Ed Yong, while not taking sides per se, nevertheless presents a plethora of evidence supporting the beneficial aspects of bacterial life. Yes, infectious disease is still a menace. Yes, antibiotics still save lives every day. However, most bacteria do not cause diseases (except in profoundly immunocompromised hosts), but they crowd out harmful pathogens on surfaces--kitchen counters as well as our skin, toilet seats as well as our guts. Overuse of antibacterial products not only promotes resistant strands of bacteria, it also kills the non-pathogenic organisms...leaving a vacuum that is filled by the most aggressive micro-organisms. But bacteria do far more than simply live on surfaces. They digest food that we can't digest ourselves, they allow squid to glow, they protect insects from predators, they provide the scent in glands which many different animals use to communicate, and they can block the malaria parasite from infecting mosquitoes. In fact, there is compelling evidence that chloroplasts and mitochondria are domesticated bacteria which now cannot live outside plant/animal cells. It would seem that the fate of animal/plant life and bacteria are entwined, for better or for worse. Yong shows ""the long waltz"" that our species have engaged in. Through natural selection bacteria evolve to better serve their hosts, and we (plants/animals) evolve to depend more and more on our bacterial companions. But while the four eukaryotic kingdoms (protists, fungi, plants, and animals) evolve at a rate that isn't particularly noticeable until many generations, bacteria can evolve at an amazingly rapid pace. They can evolve to allow rodents to eat plants that would otherwise be poisonous to them for example. This aspect of bacteria is fascinating to those in the biomed field--where researchers are hoping to discover new ways of combating diseases such as ulcerative colitis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. Far from being the enemy, many bacteria actually have the potential to save us.  My two cents : My above rambling review has barely scratched the surface how mind-blowing Yong's book is. Read this offering to see how complex and down right amazing our world is. Given 5 stars or a rating of ""Perfect"". Highly, highly recommended!!  Further Reading:  Here's a very good article from the National Institutes of Health on beneficial microbes--https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...~~Here's a fascinating look at the newest kingdom, Archaea, from the University of California, Berkley --https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/archaea/arc...~~A link to the University of Utah's page on the evolution of the cell...and an emerging theory of the origins of chloroplasts/mitochondria--https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/conte...~~Finally, H.G. Wells incorporated bacteria into the plot of his novel The War of the Worlds over 100 years ago. I *loved* his ending. But now, the part of me who finds sci-fi interesting has to ask, after reading  I Contain Multitudes , what if we (meaning plants/animals) have evolved to serve as walking vessels for bacteria? What if we serve them instead of the other way around? It's *ahem* food for thought. After all, new research shows that food cravings might be caused by the bacteria in our gut!"

88,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"“Forget Orson Welles, and heed Walt Whitman: “I am large, I contain multitudes.”“'Each animal is an ecosystem with legs,' says John Rawls.""“As palaeontologist Andrew Knoll once said, 'Animals might be evolution's icing, but bacteria are really the cake.'""Yep, Ed Yong knows how to salt and pepper his writing with some good quotes. He also pens some wonderful great-for-quoting prose himself: ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars.""“Within 24 hours of moving into a new place we overwrite it with our own microbes, turning it into a reflection of ourselves.”Yong is a great storyteller and gracefully covers a whole, er, host of topics. This is a broad-ranging book that still manages to go to fantastic depths (at which, by the way, there are many micro-organisms. Exremophiles in particular know how to go where no human has gone before, though we seem to be improving our methods of travel...)Imagine being the first person (known) to look at pond water through a microscope. You see critters moving all around and you think you're seeing things. You try again and again and star looking at all sorts of stuff. Anything you can think of. And almost everywhere you look, these little beings are zipping around. All of a sudden you realize there is a world of activity, an unknown world (or worlds) that has been there all along and their influence and importance is likely on a grand scale. It is kind of a complement to the realization that the earth revolves around the sun (i.e. it's not all about us) and that our solar system is just a few small dots in a vast network of galaxies.Yong follows the first known microscopist (to see microorganisms) into wonder and awe, and then death, and when he dies, Yong follows him back into obscurity (for one or two-hundred years?). And he brings us to the next wave of scientists studying these organisms. He talks of the theories over hundreds or thousands of years used to try to explain the work of microorganisms that was, at that point, invisible, and then brings us closer and closer to the present, as our understanding that microbes affect us grows and yet our comprehension of their intelligence, complexity and range of activity and influence often lags behind. Knowledge is anything but forward moving. There are people who lived thousands of years ago who knew much more about science than many people today. Mostly because people let inflexible (and in my experience, often dangerous) assumptions and ideologies get in the way of processes of learning and, perhaps more importantly, unlearning. For, in order to learn something new, to see something, even if is highy visible and evidence of it is incontrovertible, we often must let go of previously held notions. Yong's book is a testament to all the ways humans are wrong about things, and the endless specificity and self-importance of our vision that makes more omniscient forms of knowledge and wisdom impossible. We are always struggling to understand the world we live in, and we are often failing to see how powerful we are and yet how fallible, vulnerable and small. I wish I could write a better, more thorough review. I listened to this book on audio and I didn't take notes. Or, if I did, I cannot find them. But one of my favorite sections of the book was about worms. The work they do in the soil (and the long-term productivity of organic farming that works in collaboration with them), the revolutionary potential for use of worms to make waste management much more sustainable. And there was an interesting section on the microbiome/microbial communities in houses and hospitals as well as in the body. How trying to kill microbes is much more dangerous than trying to find a healthy balance of them. So much cool stuff in this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in illness and health (of self and community), in building balanced healthy ecosystems rather than trying to solve our problems by eradicating and flattening the communities of microbes in our midst. “Much of modern medicine is built upon the foundations that antibiotics provide, and those foundations are now crumbling.” Here is the list of chapters to give you a bit more of a sense of the trajectory:Living Islands (evolution of eukaryotes, a brief history of biological time)The People Who Thought To Look (Antony van Leeuwenhoek--early microscopists) Body Builders (and he's not talking about gyms.)Terms and Conditions Apply (our love affair with friendly microbes is not the kind of love that is unconditional. It is a lot of work to sustain healthy balances.)In Sickness And In HealthThe Long Waltz (how do symbiotic partnerships begin? How do they evolve?)Mutually Assured SuccessAllegro in E Major (microbes influence on the genome of other animals)Microbes A La Carte (trying to work with the microbiome to fight illness and create healthier body ecosystems)Tomorrow the World"
89,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"First of all, kudos for an excellent title, referencing the poetry of Walt Whitman’s Song of Myself. It is not the only literary reference and I truly appreciate that in a science writer.Yong gives the feeling of being on a safari, observing exotic wildlife. He makes single-celled organisms as interesting as wildebeest and lions. We have come a long way in understanding this part of the ecosystem, and we have miles to go before we perfect that knowledge.The microorganisms were here first. All of the multicellular animals & plants have evolved in concert with them and it should come as no surprise that we have vast colonies of microbes on us & in us. In fact, they are essential to our proper function—witness the microbe-free mice that researchers have created to experiment with these ideas. Their guts and immune systems don’t function properly and the animals don’t behave like normal animals either. Before reading this book, I had a much too simplistic view of the human microbiome. Now I know a number of the factors that can influence it (diet & antibiotics are only two of a long list) and that “good” bacteria can do bad things if the system is out of whack (dysbiosis, my new word for the month).Not to mention cool things like using bacterial infections to control mosquito-bourne diseases!Recommended reading."
90,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"You’ve got company. Carol Anne Freeling was certainly right when she said, “They’re hee-ur,” well maybe not enraged spirits, but there are certainly plenty of entities present to which we have paid insufficient attention. Maybe Regan MacNeil was closer to the mark in proclaiming “We are legion.” 
 When Orson Welles said “We’re born alone, we live alone, we die alone,” he was mistaken. Even when we are alone, we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis—a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. Some animals are colonized by microbes while they are still unfertilized eggs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then proceed through our lives in their presence. When we eat, so do they. When we travel, they come along. When we die, they consume us. Every one of us is a zoo in our own right—a colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collection. An entire world. 
Trying to map what it is to be a physical human being, in something like the  Human Genome Project, is a daunting task. But our genes tell only part of our story, like a novel with a beginning and ending but no middle. That middle is taken up by the vast array of other life that exists within our bodies. While the guests we harbor may not necessarily be in league with Satan, they are a mixed lot. They mean us no harm, particularly, and we have evolved very workable symbiotic relationships with them, but they are not necessarily our friends either. They took up residence for their own benefit and will stick around and provide benefits to us only as long as we provide what they need, like that girl/boy friend you remember with gritted teeth.I won’t say this book will blow your mind, but this is your brainAnd it’s not even Mardi Gras – from the Brain Association of MississippiThis is your brain after reading this bookShame about that haircut[In the interest of full disclosure, it should be known that every day when my wife was reading this book, she would walk in the door and tell me of yet another thing she had read that had totally blown her mind. Not that my mind didn't go Ka-Boom when I read it. It certainly it. But hers was blown first. I only steal from the best. ]I Contain Multitudes will change how you understand not only the human body, but all the biota on the planet, hell, the universe. It will help you understand how it can happen that diseases like the flu can adapt so quickly to our latest attempts to stamp them out. It will help you understand why coral reefs are dying. It will give you some new words that help keep the new knowledge manageable. (My favorite is dysbiosis which is what it sounds like, a biological parallel to dystopia, with a hint of enforced disorganization.) It will expand your appreciation for how microbial biology works within people and in the world. It will offer you hope that there can be a future in which many of our maladies will not only be diagnosable, but will be treatable with the introduction of the right, specific probiotic. It will do your dishes and massage your feet. Well, ok, not the last two, but KABOOM, big new look-at-the-world stuff. Ok, you biologist types, pre-med, med, post med, anti-med, wearers of white lab coats, whatever the length, you know this stuff, at least I hope you do. But for most of the rest of us it is indeed a big change, a new layer of reality, well maybe not entirely new, but new enough to go KABOOM!Our intro to the world of which Yong writes, antibiotics, is probably akin to the one WW II bombadiers had through their bombsites. Amazing invention/discovery, antibiotics. They do a great job of wiping out pathogens, the nasties that make us ill, well, some of them anyway. Other harmful microbial types, the viral ones, roll their eyes at incoming antibiotics and keep on with what they are up to. However, as with items dropped from passing aircraft, the use of antibiotics entails considerable collateral damage, as the human body is a container for a vast array of microbial life. One might well envision millions of non-pathogenic residents shaking their fists as the incomings not only wipe out the harmful bugs, but vast numbers of the helpful ones as well. Ed Yong offers a more on-the-ground look, filling us in on what is actually going on inside, and how this part of what’s inside relates to that other part.If these folks can have an entire civilization inside a locker, just imagine what might develop in your liver or large intestine.If you don’t know who Ed Yong is, it’s a good bet that you will before too long. Yong is a popular science guy, a Neal DeGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Mary Roach, Jacques Cousteau, David Attenborough, Carl Sagan sort, a person who can take the wild, wonderful and fascinating things that are going on in the world of science and distill them all down for public consumption without making viewers’ or readers’ eyes glaze over, or listeners’ ears suddenly clog, without making you feel like an ill-educated dolt, and he accomplishes this with enough humor to produce a fair number of smiles and an occasional LOL. (Not in Mary Roach’s league for humor, but hey, who is?) He is an award-winning science writer at The Atlantic, whose work has appeared in a wide range of publications, from The New York Times to Nature, from The Guardian to Wired, from Slate to Scientific American, and on and on. He splits his time between London and DC, and I would not be at all surprised if he dashes back and forth in a TARDIS. I have provided links in EXTRA STUFF that will lead you down rabbit holes of fun material from Yong that may take you a while to leave.Ed Yong - From SpeakerpediaAmong the many surprises you will encounter here are a squid with its own high-beams, the microbial advantage of vaginal birth, the impact of gut microbes on mood, why a third of human milk is set aside for our guests (protection payments?), the relationship between the US Navy and mucus, why no man may be an island, but we may be archipelagos, and vats more. There is serious consideration given to how our relationships with this invisible world evolved:
…animals emerged in a world that had already been teeming with microbes for billions of years. They were the rulers of the planet long before we arrived. And when we did arrive, of course we evolved ways of interacting with the microbes around us. It would be absurd not to, like moving into a new city wearing a blindfold, earplugs, and a muzzle. Besides, microbes weren’t just unavoidable: they were useful. They fed the pioneering animals. Their presence also provided valuable cues to areas rich in nutrients, to temperatures conducive to life, or flat surfaces upon which to settle. By sensing these cues, pioneering animals gained valuable information about the world around them…hints of those ancient interactions still abound today.
 “It all depends.” As if life wasn’t complicated enough. Don’t you just love it when you are looking for help and the person you are asking responds with “It all depends.” And it really does, and it really will. What will be different, though, will be that your caregiver will have a much better idea than most caregivers can possibly have today. They will be able to look at a profile from a type of blood test and match potential solutions to the bacteria living in your gut, or wherever else in your two-legged bacteria condo might pertain. This knowledge is still in its infancy – at least a broad knowledge, but it is coming, and has the potential to make meaningful improvements in our health.
As microbiologist Patrice Cani told me, “The future will be a la carte.”And in this a la carte future, we won’t have to stop at picking the right bacteria for the job. Some scientists are picking the right genes for the job, and combining them into artisanal bacteria. Rather than just recruiting species with the right abilities, they are tinkering with the microbes themselves to endow them with new skills. 
Balance – from Explainxkcd.comThis raises some concerns, although they do not get a lot of attention here. If scientists can develop designer probiota to ameliorate suffering, there will always be evil-doers eager to use new technology to make designer biota intended to act as pathogens. In fact that is pretty much my sole gripe about this book. I wish more space had been devoted to the potential dangers of this advancing treatment modality. Just ask yourself, What would ISIS do?The title of Ed Yong’s book may not be up there with The Selfish Gene, Silent Spring, or Guns, Germs and Steel but what it lacks in snappy-ness it more than makes up for in content. This is a smart, readable explanation of one of the major ongoing scientific revolutions of our time. If you look deep inside yourself you will know that this is absolutely must-read material.

91,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"I feel like this book really exemplifies what I want from a science book written for a mass audience. It made everything really accessible and easy to understand without sacrificing on providing details or explanations. It provides a lot of citations so I can go look up the specific research papers and experiments mentioned that are of most interest to me, which I did. It also just connected research to larger ideas and theories for why things work the way they do. I think the whole point of science and the interest in it has to do with its ability to provide insight and answers into the why of things, at least for me. I also think Yong was really good about explaining the limitations of the research while also making the reader excited about where things could potentially go. Like I think it can be quite hard to straddle that line between talking about the exciting potential of something while also being clear that it might not go anywhere and that there's a lot of complexity and limitation in science. Also he mentioned one of my favorite books of all time, The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life, at the beginning so that automatically made me like the author a lot more. Anyways I really enjoyed this, I know I've been reading a lot of non-fiction so far this year, and this has definitely been one of the best ones so fat this year."
92,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,5,"For my entire hospital career I have worked in oncology, where I have been part of teams taking care of people with cancer. Frequently patients have “neutropenic fevers,” a condition considered to be potentially harmful and almost always requiring admission to the hospital. Neutrophils are those brave little white blood cells that go out into our bodies and do battle with all the nasty things our bodies are exposed to every day. Neutropenia means the patient has none of those cells to speak of (and this is why herd immunity and vaccines are important). We culture blood and urine, scan lungs, treat with antibiotics, and monitor for a few days to see if any microbes grow out in cultures. We teach people to fastidiously handwash, and avoid people who are sick. We make them wear masks in the hallways, in order to filter out airborne viruses. Their rooms have special filtration systems. We encourage them to make safe food choices, avoiding foods that can’t be washed or scrubbed clean, or might be undercooked. And you want to know the kicker? If these patients are infected, it’s usually because of microbes in their own body have run amok and caused infection.You know what else is in the hospital? Microbes. Tons of antibiotic-resistant microbes, hanging out in patient bodies and everywhere else. Once someone is cultured positive for these microbes, they stay on “isolation” for the duration of the visit--and sometimes for life in the case of microbes resistant to all antibiotics--in the (vain) hopes that staff, visitors and patients won’t go moving those resistant microbes around the hospital. A shift where I don’t where a yellow isolation gown to go into these rooms is pretty unusual.Yong made my little grey cells stretch and reach, and now I have yet more ways to think about microbes, and I dearly wish he would re-write this book–maybe in magazine form–every couple years so I can keep up with all the interesting research. Like David Quammen, Yong doesn’t just stick to one branch of research science; he wanders around many fields as he explores the impact microbes have made on us. He’ll first have you thinking about their sheer evolutionary weight (literally and figuratively), reminding us that we evolved in context of a microbe landscape, not the other way round (and some thought apes were a stretch). Like living on a planet where most of the water is saltwater, it makes sense that microbes would impact the evolution of life.Yong walks the reader through some of the science that show how animals evolved to use microbes (and perhaps vice versa?). Some are evolutionary, some genetic, some macro. There’s a lovely experiment where a glowing squid developed a sequestered area for those microbes–can’t set them free in the body, of course, so you have to create a special compartment.In other words, I highly recommend this book. It’s quite well researched and documented, with extensive citations. There’s a bibliography and index, for those that want to delve further or pick and choose. As a further note, I’ll say that I always appreciate researchers/writers who express appreciation for those they interview and follow, without being fawning, and Yong does a nice job with that as well. There are parts I really liked, parts I liked less, parts where someone should have trimmed his descriptive writing just a tad, but any book that keeps me thinking about it months later is a five star read.I’m going to put my detailed book report below page break at my wordpress site ( https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2019/...) with notes heavily on the medical and the ocean science. There’s also some interesting stuff about insects, for those who might lean that way, and trees."

The first associations are not symbiosis and better health but infection and disease because the negative image is over-represented. Hygiene and health are essential, but the benefits of invisible companions are far too rarely highlighted and the beneficial minis outweigh the pests by far. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms is necessary for good health, built on a microorganism friendly diet.Without a symbiosis with a few pounds of microorganisms that are spread over and through the whole body, human life would not be possible, metabolic processes would stop death would be inevitable. A co-evolution has made all higher living beings dependent on the colonizers because they defend humans against enemy invaders which could harm their host. Of course, they also assist with bodily functions because they bring benefits to them so that the motivation for the defense help is not purely altruistic. They form a second front against attackers and it are often the human eaters themselves who are to blame when they wreck their microflora and lose the second shield because of permanently unhealthy nom nom.The coevolution of higher life with invisible helpers is long and has usually developed into a symbiosis. Much has happened since the first bacterium settled in a higher being while it was itself being altered by a virus etc.The ever more severe human intervention in this cycle has led to problems within less than 75 years. Since the advent of antibiotics and serial mass production of drugs, allergies, food sensitivities, autoimmune diseases, multidrug-resistant germs, lifestyle diseases, etc. are on the rise. How much of this is related to the destruction of the natural balance in the body, can be difficult to estimate due to a lack of studies. A one-sided diet with an excessive intake of antibiotics in addition to various other drugs is an essential factor that turns the symbiosis into a dysbiosis.Many drugs include, as a side effect, a mass extinction combined with a collapse of the miniaturized social order, civil wars and a lengthy reconstruction of it. With medicine and hygiene, much money can be made and as a result, super-pathogens grow in hospitals, while chemical gangs in the body of the patients decimate the defense forces of the body.Therapies with alternative and gentler drugs would be a new competitive and biological disinfectant and more expensive than artificial chemicals in the short term without including long-time costs. The patients pay for this with their health and sometimes life.The potential market with tailor-made probiotics and the manipulation and improvement of microfauna with genetically modified organisms is a future-oriented industry. As soon as enough bucks are made with conventional medicine, the Big Players will enter it. Until then it will be vilified and kept down.Actually the effort, according to the standards of medical economics, would not be responsible. Individualized medicine would have to first check the patients for potential vulnerabilities in their microbiome and then create a tailored therapy for them. A great alternative for rich people, but all others continue to receive the standard procedure of conventional treatment that kills friend and foe alike.If one eats microbe-hostile, one gets problems because a healthy, natural and balanced diet ensures a stable and robust micro-environment. Industrially highly processed and unhealthy food kills many of the little helpers and in their places settle less species-rich constellations, sometimes almost monocultures of dodgy creaturs. These not only damage health in addition to the unhealthy diet but also ensure that the desire for excessive and destructive gluttony with junk food never breaks off in the brain. Their interest in a steady supply is justified. A dietary change to fresh, low-fat, salt-reduced and sugar-free diets could significantly reduce their intake. Everyone has to make a choice themselves. Fit and peaceful armies that have lived and protected us for eons or, alternatively, mercenary junkie armies with dubious loyalty, prone to excesses and arson. One willingly lets them move around in the heartland until one loses control over them or they desert and begin dismantling oneself from within. Many times, a supposed protective power has in retrospect proved to be the worst enemy.The brain partakes at every meal and accordingly, the performance can be expanded or reduced. Not only the body feels sluggish after too much food, but the gray cells are overwhelmed too. It is not so much the energy used in digestion or the inertia that sets in with permanent overeating. Much more the fuel of the brain is of poor quality. In the car or an expensive machine, one would not pour substandard gasoline or cheap oil. This mentality does not apply to one's own body. From one-sided nutrition with inferior food of low quality less valuable substances can be extracted, which would be necessary for optimal brain function. One eats oneself dumb.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiota"
94,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten,5,"”The latest estimates suggest that we have around 30 trillion human cells and 39 trillion microbial ones – a roughly even split. Even these numbers are inexact, but that does not really matter: by any reckoning, we contain multitudes.”“Perhaps it is less that I contain multitudes and more that I am multitudes.”I realized, as I was reading this book, that I have not had antibiotics in over twenty-five years. When I shared that information with my friends, the reactions were anywhere from “Wow” to “that is impossible.” Those reactions indicated to me how overly reliant we have become on antibiotics to fight what we perceive to be bad microbes. Of course, antibiotics are indiscriminate in what they kill. They are definitely a kill-them-all-and-let-Odin-sort-them-out kind of killer. ”But antibiotics are shock-and-awe weapons. They kill the bacteria we want as well as those we don’t – an approach that’s like nuking a city to deal with a rat. We don’t even need to see the rat to begin the massacre: many antibiotics are prescribed needlessly to treat viral infections they have no hope of countering.”I don’t get sick very often, and when I do, I seem to get sick to a lesser extent than do other people who are suffering from the same malady. Lucky genetics or maybe I’ve got a well balanced microbiome. I grew up on a farm and was exposed to a lot of microbes, more than the average person. In fact, one of the problems that is plaguing the first world is the fact that a greater percentage of people are not exposed to animals, a great source of useful microbes, or even just the outdoors, where we encounter microbes, bad and good, that help us format a diverse microbiome. They live in concrete worlds that are beneficial to health in the short term, but bad for health in the long term. They don’t run a gauntlet of infectious diseases that actually make them more resilient to illnesses. Their immune systems lack experience and become jumpy, overreacting to allergies and other minor threats. I think we may discover that microbes hold the key to all of our health issues. Big Brother might be watching us go about our daily lives, but what about the control imposed by the Orwellian, brainless, single-cell organisms inside of us? What we eat may not always be our idea. I’ve always been a bit wary of being manipulated by my own hormones, but what if I’m being manipulated by the microbes in my digestive tract as to what foods I like? ”Different microbes fare better on certain diets. Some are peerless at digesting plant fibres. Others thrive on fats. When you choose your meals, you are also choosing which bacteria get fed, and which get an advantage over their peers. But they don’t have to sit there and graciously await your decision. As we have seen, bacteria have ways of hacking into the nervous system. If they released dopamine, a chemical involved in feelings of pleasure and reward, when you ate the ‘right’ things, could they potentially train you to choose certain foods over others? Do they get a say in your menu picks?”So lean people have different levels of certain microbes in their digestive tract than overweight people. They tend to have a more balanced diet, heavy in veggies and fruits. Wonderful news, right? So to lose weight, all we have to do is take microbes from lean people and put them in overweight people. If only it were that easy. The problem is, those lean, mean producing microbes need to eat, so if the overweight person doesn’t change his diet and feed those microbes what they want to eat, they starve. This is, of course, an oversimplification of all the issues that go into trying to improve or change a microbiome, but the possibilities, with further research, are encouraging. I know we all want the magic pill that doesn’t require us to change our lifestyle or food choices, but what if your food preferences are being dictated by a microbe that has hijacked your nervous system to manipulate you into feeding it what it wants? That to me is sort of like being possessed by a demon. “‘America is a constipated nation,’ he said, indelicately. ‘If you pass small stools, you have big hospitals.’” If I miss a day not passing a bowel movement, I get annoyed. I like it when my intestinal tract is working like a well-oiled machine. I want the outgoing to keep up with the incoming. Nothing makes me feel less healthy than to think of BM hanging out in my intestinal tract any longer than it has to. When my digestive tract is working the way I want it to, it is operating to the theme song of Rawhide.
”Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'RawhideShe rollin', rollin', rollin'Though the streams are swollenKeep them doggies rollin', rawhideThrough rain an' wind an' weatherHellbent for leatherMove 'em on, head 'em upHead 'em up, move 'em onMove 'em on, head 'em upRawhide.”
 We are coming out of an era where we were convinced that any microbe was a bad microbe and finally are starting to embrace the idea that some microbes are not only good for us but essential. We pick up microbes from the people around us, and some of those microbes get added to our microbiome. I was reading this article, titled Your Partner could affect Your Microbiome, about a study conducted on heterosexual couples to see how much influence each had on the other’s microbiome. ”After testing the samples, the researchers noted that microbes had been swapped between couples to a significant enough extent that computer algorithms were able to link a person to their partner with an accuracy of 86 percent.” Makes me wonder about the 14%: so how much interaction do you have with your partner? The next thought, of course, is to think about the fact that your partner also brings with her the microbes received from past partners, and now those microbes have been shared with you. *Shudder* It is probably best not to think about it. I came away from reading this book thinking that microbes might provide solutions to many health issues that have plagued us for generations, such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and autoimmune disorders. Microbes have the ability to adapt and borrow from other microbes and change their makeup and purpose. The possibilities are, therefore, endless for us to find elusive cures hidden right in the microscopic multitudes within us. We have used microbes to dengue-fever proof mosquitoes and to save skin infected frogs from Amphibiageddon. My question is, can we use some of those breakthroughs to save the bees and potentially even the human race? The sky's the limit, and only with the very recent change in mindset about microbes have we begun to explore the potential. We have one great advantage…we know microbes exist! So take care of your microbiome, and start by reading this fascinating book. You will look at the world you can’t see with microscopic eyes.

95,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,0,"Update: Antibiotics and obesity. It is routine in the US (although banned in the UK and Canada) to give cows, pigs, chickens etc low doses of antibiotics in order to fatten them up. No one knows why the antibiotics make them gain weight on the same amount of food, but they do. There is no reason to suppose that we are any different. The mechanism has to do with altering the biome, the microbes in the body, but how long the effect lasts isn't known, it might be a lifetime thing.Antibiotics and resistance. We are told that we are overprescribed antibiotics and that is causing resistance, but the amount of antibiotics any individual gets is absolutely minor compared to the amount that we consume. Not only consume from meat, but since animal droppings are used for fertilizer, perhaps from our bread and vegetables and water too. It reminds me of recycling and the emphasis on all of us individuals doing it. However, 98% of all waste is industrial, retail and from restaurants. Go to many supermarkets and they charge you for a plastic bag (if they even have them), go to a 'green' supermarket like Whole Foods and they give a paper one. Then look at the produce, it's packed in plastic, the meat is in styrofoam, the deli salads in plastic, the knife and fork you got to eat them with are plastic, the coffe cup (recyclable!) has a plastic lid, the bottle of juice is probably plastic but the straw is paper. Plastic is cheap and convenient, clean, easy to store and keeps things fresh. Why change if you can make people feel they are the problem and that you are helping them to do the right thing? It's just clever marketing. They are the 98% of the problem and until they address the issues of pollution and climate change in their own industries and stores, no matter how hard we try, we will only make ... 2% of a difference.____________________Schizophrenia used to be blamed on cold mothers, autism likewise, it was the mother's fault. We've moved on now to proving it is the mother getting flu or measles (why didn't she get vaccinated, oh how could she do this and risk inflicting her child.... dadadada. Oh no she couldnt' get vaccinated because that causes.... dadadada).   ""Patterson had read that pregnant women who incur serious infections, like flu or measles, are more likely to have kids with autism and schizophrenia. He thought that a mother's immune responses might somehow affect the development of her baby's brain. He just didn't know how."".......... ""And they realised that Patterson's mice had gut problems in common with actual autistic children: both were likely to have diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal disorders, and both harboured unusual comunities of gut bicrobes. Perhaps, the duo reasoned, fixing those gut problems might also lead to changes in behaviour."" And so it goes on, these male scientists keen to prove that these links to lab mice proved the mother caused autism in her babies. Until, science writer, a woman, Emily Willingham points out that, 
""Mice don't have autism, which is a human neurobiological construct shaped in part by social and cultural perceptions of what is considered normal. Is a mouse repeatedly burying a marble really like a child rocking back and forth? Is a lower frequency of squeaks the same as being unable to talk to other people? If you squint just so, the similarities jump out . Look again and and you might see parallels with other conditions. 
Then the killer - the lab mice used were originally bred to model schizophrenia. So you have scientists saying that the bacteria in the guts of autistic babies and schizophrenic mice who cannot possibly be bred in any way to be autistic proves that it is the mother is responsible, it's just more time is needed to find the proof, the microbes responsible.It's scientific confirmation bias. It's akin to a scientific conspiracy theory. One way or another the mother must be blamed. And say, as the woman science writer says, that all these gut problems can be seen as not just similarities but absolute parallels to other conditions, not autism ."
96,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40898015-jamie,5,"Well, I will never think of bacteria and archaea the same. I certainly have a newfound understanding of just how vital it is to every part of life. That microbes and bacteria have helped shape our planet for billions of years, down to every single flora and fauna; even all the oxygen we breath has come from bacteria. I also never really thought about the microbes that are constantly around us and even on me, or how many you are ""seeding"" to the world. That""every person aerosolises 37 million bacteria per hour"". And, if that isn't crazy enough, how about ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars"". To me, learning all of this was just simply incredible-the effortless symbiosis of microbes with the environment and with ourselves. I could go on and on about this book-so I will end with is, this is hands down one of my favorite science books. The ""science"" wasn't intimidating to read, as the author didn't assume you were already an expert on the subject. It wasn't dry either, and a few parts made me laugh. This book would be great for anyone who is interested in learning about the unseen world going on all around them. "
97,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a fascinating book about the microbes inside all of us, and inside other animals as well. Now, it is often said that there are ten times as many bacteria in our bodies as there are cells. This, it turns out, is probably an over-estimate; the number of bacteria is probably in the same ballpark as the number of cells. But still, that is a lot!This book goes into detail about the amazing partnerships--the symbioses--between microbes and large organisms, mostly animals and humans. Microbes are essential to digestion, to our immune systems, and many other functions.Every person has his own population of microbes, which can be different between individuals. And we spread our microbes around; every day we deposit 30 million of them by breathing, touching things, and by excretions.Most microbes are not harmful to humans. But the distinction between harmful and not harmful and helpful is not always crystal clear. Microbes in our guts help digestion, but if they escape into the blood stream they can be deadly. I really enjoyed learning how dengue can be prevented by infecting mosquitos with a common bacterium called Wolbachia.I learned all sorts of great things. For example, probiotic foods and supplements have not been proven to be effective. Also, toilets that are cleaned too often are more likely to be covered in bacteria. And, hospital rooms with closed windows contain more deadly microbes than the fresh air outside. Some scientists believe that microbes are responsible for obesity, and even for high blood pressure.This book is actually fun to read, filled with subtle humor, and extremely informative. This book is so well written, I must recommend it to everyone."
98,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84916113-somebunny-reads-phoenix,5,"I am Legion.  So, apparently human beings (and all beings in general) are just bags of bacteria and other microorganisms, and these fascinating fellas have always dominated the Earth, from the birth of life to present days: there are more bacteria in our guts than starts in our galaxy. Interesting, uh? I would say a wonderful topic for a wonderful book! I loved this book and found it extremely interesting for many reasons. First, because it was very well-written, and second because it opened my mind to the fascinating field of microbiology, which I'd never think it would be for interest for me (a linguist). This book literally opened a new door for me, and since starting this read I watched documentaries and collected all kinds of information on bacteria, virus, and microorganisms in general. For example, did you know that our body contains so many bacteria that there are roughly the same amount of human cells and bacteria cells inside it? Or that sponges are such simple animals and yet full of microbes that sometimes, if you look at a sponge under a microscope, you will barely be able to see the animal for the microbes that cover it? Or that there is such a thing as a poop transplant (Faecal Microbiota Transplant, or FMT), in which stool samples from one healthy individual are inserted into someone else's intestines to re-create a healthy microbe environment and thus fighting many digestion-related illnesses? This book was all extremely interesting, and I think it also contains two very important messages to always keep in mind: first (something that many people, but not all people, know), that not all microorganisms are bad, and some of them are not only fundamental to sustain life and normal functions of animals and plants, but can also be used to cure health conditions and preserve the environment. Our indiscriminate war against germs, overdoing with disinfectant and antibiotics, is both straightening bad bacteria and endangering good ones, with repercussions on our and our Planets's health. Second, that this field is one of the most futurist fields of science, and we'll probably see incredible developments in the future: the creation of medicines based on probiotics, bacteria artificially engineered to fight diseases; and, incidentally, we'll probably see a lot of this stuff in sci-fi. Of course, as the author himself points out, scientists always have the ambition to find a grand unified theory, a master equation which can elegantly explain our universe, and microbiology, with its recent discoveries on how our life on the Planet started (seriously, look it up or read about it in this book, it's fascinating), how microorganisms are intertwined with hosts in complex symbiotic relationships which can even affect genome, and how much we could potentially do/cure just using bacteria, is currently one of the most fashionable candidates. Without having to believe that bacteria is the solution to all our problems, from dying crops to saving the coral reef and solve both malnutrition and obesity, let alone eradicating lymphatic filariasis and dengue fever; we instead can and should try to educate ourselves more about the microcosm which thrives inside of us and inside the smallest of bugs, so that we can learn how to respect it and be aware of the danger those small little things can pose to us, but also us to them. Bacteria can get extinct too, and who knows how many good friends we used to have in our guts before we killed them and started getting irritable bowls! Save your friendly neighbour bacterium!!! "

This is especially true of our warm moist bodies - which are covered inside and out with microorganisms....and this is a good thing.Bacteria are on and in our bodiesIn fact our bodies are really an indivisible aggregate of 'our' tissues and organs....and the microbial world that makes its home there. Moreover this is true for every multicellular organism on Earth. The totality of microorganisms (and their parts) in/on our bodies is called our 'microbiome', and it's composed of myriad kinds of bacteria, viruses, archaea, snippets of microbial DNA, and other miniscule microbial fragments. This microbiome helps digest our food, produces vitamins and minerals, breaks down toxins and dangerous chemicals, guides our embryonic development, assists our immune system, probably influences our behavior, and so on. There are many kinds of microbes in the worldIn this entertaining and illuminating book, Yong touches on the evolution of microbes; the history of microbiology; symbiotic relationships among microbes; symbiosis between microbes and higher organisms; dysbiosis (unbalanced microbiomes that harm their hosts); how scientists study and identify microbiomes; research studies aimed at seeding hospitals and buildings with 'good microbes'; and much more.Symbiotic microbes provide nutrients for plantsHospitals are covered with microorganisms. Seeding hospitals with 'good microbes' might prevent 'bad microbes' from growing.Most people probably associate microbes with disease, and Yong provides some examples of pathogenic organisms. The vast majority of microbes are beneficial though, and I was fascinated to read about their varied roles in the world of living things. I've had a rather varied career and in a galaxy far away and long ago I got a degree in microbiology.....but this book has a lot of new and exciting information. I'll give examples of a few intriguing factoids gleaned from the book:1. We can improve our health by nurturing 'helpful' bacteria in our digestive system. Since fiber-loving bacteria are supposed to boost the immune system I added a LOT of fiber to my diet.....and I think I feel healthier already!! We need 'good microbes' in our stomach 2. Newborns are bathed in good microbes during vaginal delivery. Thus, infants born by caesarean section - lacking this initial 'seeding' - develop different microbiomes than vaginal babies. Breast-feeding also provides babies with an initial dose of beneficial microbes. 3. It's good for kids to have a dog because the pooch brings outdoor microbes into the home. Being exposed to a larger variety of microorganisms reduces the likelihood of getting allergies. 4. The author, Ed Yong, really likes the Hawaiian bobtail squid, which contains large colonies of luminous bacteria. Whenever Yong mentions this critter he calls it 'adorable.' (ha ha ha)Bacteria make squids luminous This tome covers a fascinating array of topics in an understandable - and sometimes humorous - fashion. I love this book and would recommend it to everyone.

100,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"Recently I've been hearing reports of miracle cures of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by use of fecal matter transplants. Also I've heard that some autoimmune diseases may be caused by environments that are too clean. Upon hearing these things the question that comes to my mind is, why this new found enthusiasm for microorganisms? We've known about bacteria since Louis Pasteur. So why all this new information about microbes as if it was something new? (Actually we learn in this book that Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered the prevalence of bacteria on all sorts of surfaces in the 1680s, but for unexplained reasons his findings were pretty much ignored for 200 years.) What I learned from this book is that the new technologies of gene sequencing and genomics has changed everything. Before gene sequencing careful study of microbes was limited to those that could be grown on a culture medium. With current tools it is possible to sequence every single gene in a sample from a skin flake, stream bed, or any environmental or body surface. Suddenly researchers were able to provide detailed descriptions of myriad microbiota (This book uses the term microbiome.)What scientists are learning is that the number, variety and prevalence of microorganisms exceeded all expectations. Combined with our understanding of evolution we now know that all of life has co-evolved within close contact with microbes. Consequently many functions of animal life are either dependent on, or aided and regulated by, microorganisms. Food digestion is a leading example of this. This book warns that current science is in the early phases of understanding microbiomes and that we shouldn't become too excited about spectacular claims made by probiotic manufacturers. However, I believe that the wording used by this book in some cases hypes things a bit too much. In particular I'm don't like the way this book makes the statement that, ""The majority of cells in our body are not human, they're microbes."" Technically that statement is true, but it is misleading. The statement is true regarding the number of cells, but not mass (i.e. weight). Only about 1 to 3 percent of the human body weight is from microbes located mostly in the gut. The reason for this disparity between mass and numbers of cells is that most human cells (e.g. muscle, fat, & blood cells) are larger and more massive than bacterial cells. The information I've explained above about the mass of human cells and bacterial cells is not explained in this book. The book simply makes the statement regarding the number of cells which I'm sure will lead some people to make the declarative statement, ""Did you know that most of the human body is made of bugs?""The book explains why we should think of bacteria and viruses as companions, not enemies. Our efforts at being antibacterial—killing all microbial growth—can sometimes provide an environment in which pathogens can proliferate. But there is one quotation in the book by a doctor that provided another perspective to consider. ""I've never seen anybody die from getting antibiotics, but I've seen some die from the lack of them.""Also, our immune system evolved in an environment of mild background contamination. Thus, our modern clean living environments may be a contributor to increased occurrences of some autoimmune ailments. But of course we all know that contaminated environments can cause disease. Perhaps, as we learn more about microbiomes we'll learn to get the level of contamination just right. This book provides a good overall discussion of the expanding knowledge and understanding of microbes.The following is a link to an excerpt from the book about ""when Leeuwenhoek discovered Microorganisms:http://www.delanceyplace.com/view-arc..."
101,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"I liked this book so I am giving it three stars. It is common knowledge today that everything and all of us are covered with microbes - that some are good and some are bad. Their number can be debated. We have in the past been fixated on getting rid of them. This has been to our detriment. It is clear we have gone too far. Antibiotics are good and necessary, but at the same time they must be used with care. In heedlessly wiping out microbes, we have created an environment where pathogens proliferate. This book is about the symbiosis we have with the microbes living on and in our bodies and in our environment. It is about our need to develop a harmonious relationship between us and them. The book begins with a rather long introduction. I wanted the book to get going; what we were being told was all too general. The introduction is followed by a chapter which focuses on the history of bacteriology, beginning with the Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's (1632 - 1723) development of the microscope. He was the first to observe and describe single celled organisms. The growth of microbiology is reviewed through a discussion of the discoveries of scientists such as Louis Pasteur, Élie Metchnikoff, Theodor Rosebury, René Dubos and others. Microbiologists one has heard of and others less well-known. After the historical review, the remainder of the book contains fascinating information on more contemporary studies, but there is no real structure to the presentation. First of all, the titles of the chapters do not clearly indicate what the chapter will be about. Here are four titles so you can see what I mean:-The Long Waltz-Mutually Assured Success-Allegro in E Major -Microbes à la CarteOn completion of a chapter I had learned a smattering of information, all of which I had found interesting, but what exactly that particular chapter was focused upon most often eluded me. Topics brought up in one chapter come up again in another. For me, when reading a non-fiction book on a topic where my own knowledge is weak, I need structure. There is a heavy use of acronyms and scientific abbreviations, which are explained once, but most often just once. The same is true of the scientific terms used for particular experimental procedures, chemical compounds and pathogens. You can read this book without in-depth previous knowledge, but the more you know before you pick it up the easier it will be to understand. It definitely helped me to have recently read The Gene: An Intimate History. Today scientists are sequencing the genes of the microbes around us. Bacteria readily swap genes, something which humans do not do, but our cells can integrate foreign genetic material from bacteria. It is important to stress that we are today only beginning to understand the symbiotic relationship between our cells and the microbes living in, on and around us. This book does not give definitive answers but indicates where the future may take us. Numerous studies are cited. Here follow examples of topics discussed - fecal transplants, probiotics, studies on the bacteria feeding sugars in breast milk, the beneficial qualities of vaginal microbes for babies’ health and gut microbes in preventing obesity and autoimmune diseases, the value of dogs in increasing the microbe diversity in our homes, the decimation of coral reefs, squid with luminous bacteria. The topics are many and not only about humans, but other flora and fauna too. The book provides a lot of really interesting information, but I wanted a better structure to it all.The audiobook is very well narrated by Charlie Anson. Clear and easy to follow. The narration I have given four stars."

""Every time we touch an object, we leave a microbial imprint upon it. Every time we walk, talk, scratch, shuffle, or sneeze, we cast a personalised cloud of microbes into space. Every person aerosolises around 37 million bacteria per hour. This means that our microbiome isn't confined to our bodies. It perpetually reaches out into our environment."""

106,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Yong explores the microbiome, not just in humans but in many creatures. He reveals the amazing variety of ways that microorganisms influence their multicellular counterparts. A properly balanced microbiome is not only critical to health, but can be essential to proper development, reproduction and survival. In essence we are one system with the many trillions of foreign organisms in our bodies. We rely on each other. Not that there is a clear cut line between beneficial and pathogenic, a single organism can be both depending on the circumstances. As Yong notes, the immune system is not just a defense against disease causing organisms, it is a manager of our microbiome, ideally operating to maximize its benefits and minimize its dangers.Yong offers numerous examples of the codependence of microbes and animals including humans. One example we can easily relate to concerns a mother’s milk. In human milk there are sugars called human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), over 200 different ones, yet infants are not able to digest them. However, there is a bacteria that eats it all up, Bifidobacterium longum infantis. In return it feeds short-chain fatty acids to the gut cells. B. infantis also helps these cells generate an adhesive to fill gaps between them and it promotes the cells’ manufacture of anti-inflammatory compounds. Not only that, B. infantis helps infant brains grow by producing the sialic acid they need. And there is more. B. infantis attracts some pathogens acting as a decoy preventing them from invading gut cells. This microbe earns its keep.We are familiar with the term symbiosis which applies to the relationship between the microbiome and humans. Endosymbiosis is a more exact description of that relationship since the microbes live in and on us. Yong uses the term dysbiosis to describe when that relationship goes awry, when there is a loss of balance between the microbiome and the immune system. Such an imbalance can contribute to illness and conditions such as nutritional deficiency, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, and many, many more. Unfortunately pinning down the exact constituents of the microbiome responsible is very difficult. Typically there is not one bad actor, but varying mixes of microbes that cause trouble and then only in people with particular genetics or circumstances. Think of your body as an ecosystem. One piece may go astray, but real trouble doesn’t show up until many pieces have been affected, making it exceedingly problematic to understand how the imbalance begins.Biologist Lynn Margulis, persevering in the face of intense criticism, became famous for making the evolutionary role of endosymbiosis credible. Today it is a widely accepted explanation for the mitochondria in our cells which came from a captured bacterium. She also came up with the word holobiant to describe a community of species that stay together throughout their lives including us and our microbiome. This concept can also be applied to genes. Biologists such as Richard Dawkins consider animals and other life forms to be vehicles for genes. Evolution operates to select genes. Their vehicles can change as needed. The genes in our microbiome directly influence our well-being and behavior. Shouldn’t they be considered a part of the set of genes being selected for in our evolution? In other words, the genes of the holobiant together determine the evolutionary vehicle. Consider the example Yong offers of two “species” of closely related flies. They were thought to be separate species. They never mated and they contained different microbiomes. But give them antibiotics and they will successfully mate. Microbes can change an animal’s smell and other factors that can determine mating preference. Eventually these two fly communities with different microbiomes will become distinct species if they never mate. Just as with these flies, it is our hologenome that may be deciding our future.Yong explores the therapeutic potential of changing our microbiome. We make a stab at this today with prebiotics, probiotics and fecal transplants. But to reliably tackle most conditions will require cocktails of bacteria properly proportioned to individual needs. These would require testing for efficacy and safety as would any medicine. We also need to think carefully about how antibiotics and antimicrobials affect the microbiome and the bacteria we encounter. As we begin the age of gene therapy, we can consider not only manipulating the bacteria in our microbiomes but their genes as well. Microbes can be much more easily engineered with genes than can animal cells. Bacteria exchange genes through horizontal transfer. They don’t have to inherit them but can readily pick them up from their neighbors. Thus genes from transient bacteria can get into your microbiome. Astounding, however, is the increasing evidence of bacterial gene horizontal transfer into animal cells. This is particularly true of insects which often have very intimate relationships with bacteria. How this happens needs to be explored. Throughout the book Yong relates example after example of the codependence of animals and bacteria. Bacteria can shape organ development, not only determine sex but change sex after it is established, stop or enable reproduction, stop or enable parasites, provide or block essential nutrients, eradicate or promote a species, decimate or protect a crop, alter the environment and much, much more. Yong makes the case that we need to consider our relationship with bacteria particularly our hologenome if we are to understand our health, our behavior and our future. We are at the beginning of a new appreciation of the role bacteria play in the world, what it means to be human, and new approaches to tackle disease as well as shape our minds and bodies."
107,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49847688-emily,5,"A NEW NONFICTION FAVORITE!!! I'M SO HAPPY.This is absolutely fabulous scientific nonfiction. I think at times, scienctific nonfiction swings one of two ways--over simplified, or overly pendantic. This book truly hit the sweet spot. It's accessible, gorgeously written, and incredibly informative and well-researched.In particular, I liked that Yong doesn't shy away from differing schools of thought. Microbiology as we know it today is still a relatively new science, and as such there are a LOT of different opinions. Yong engages with all of the these. The level of nuance within this book is astounding, and truly elevates it.I also REALLY appreciated that Yong doesn't assume you miraculously remembered every detail from earlier chapters. He would repeat meanings behind acronyms, descriptions of bacteria and cell functions, and a whole lot of other things. However, this never feels repetitive. He's succinct, but also recognizes that his readers might, by chapter 8, forget a line or two from chapter 1. I definitely recommend this!"
108,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50066399-diane-in-australia,4,"I did enjoy this book, but it didn't 'wow' me as much as some of the other reviewers. In fact, I started it awhile ago, and just got distracted by other books, and put it down ... which never happens, if I'm enthralled by a book. When I finally came back to it, I did learn a few things, and read a few things aloud to hubby, so, all-in-all I suppose it was a 'good read'.4 Stars = Outstanding. It definitely held my interest."
109,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17746077-joshua-buhs,4,"A fascinating topic poorly served by the conventions of popular science writing.Ed Yong's book is about microbes--bacteria, mostly, but also viruses and few other extremely small creatures--and how they live with other organisms--humans for the most part, with plenty of other animals, too, though no plants.It has Darwinian ambitions, announced in its subtitle: ""A Grander View of Life"" evokes Darwin's famous phrase closing the first edition of ""On the Origin of Species"": ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.""And it is there in the basic organizing principle of the book. Darwin followed the recommendation of the philosopher of science William Whewell that a good scientific theory account for a range of facts--he called this the ""consilience of induction."" Yong is out to conciliate some inducting, too--so to speak--setting out a view of the interactions between animals and microbes that is extensive.For the past one hundred and fifty or so years, microbes have been mostly seen in the light of germ theory: that is, they have been either classed ad pathological or of little interest. In the last four decades (or so), a new view has taken shape: that microbes are neither good nor bad. But they are ubiquitous. And they are *integral* to multicellular life. Some are pathological. Some perform vital functions. They form an entire ecosystem, one upon which life depends, but one that has been mostly ignored, mostly invisible.As I say, this is a great story, with very important repercussions. The details are fascinating, and Yong is great at explaining the complex interplay between microbes and multicellular organisms in easy to understand ways--that usually do not feel condescending. (I could've used a little less forced humor: de gustibus and all that, though.) Just dipping into the various chapters and reading the sections involves one in some remarkable bits of biology. The book, on the level of the sections, is genuinely fun.There are, of course, important sequelae to this line of thought. One set concerns how we are to live in the world when we know its expanded dimension. Food choices, medicine choices, standard questions about environmental protection--all become more complicated when we have to take microbiology into account. This ""grander view"" of life also calls into question traditional boundaries--between the self and the environment, between humans and other organisms. If bacteria help to build your immune system, what does that mean for ideas about the integrity of the body? If moods and behaviors are effected by gut flora, what does that mean about human will and determinism?Darwin's book was arranged unusually--though brilliantly, in its way. (Waiting twenty years to publish gives certain advantages!) He started with artificial selection, as something most people would understand. Then, in the next two chapters, showed how the elements of artificial selection were inherent in nature, too: one chapter explored natural variety, the other natural competition. Chapter four then tied these various strands together, showing how natural selection worked in nature as an analogue of artificial selection. The remainder of the book--to simplify matters--gathers together a host of facts that can all be explained by natural selection, from the geological record to what we would now call genetics.Yong's book does not work quite so well on the level of chapters. It's fine, but not quite as elegant. There are basically three introductory chapters: one is a prologue, which situates Yong at a zoo watching a scientist investigate the microbial flora on the body of a pangolin. He then moves to another introductory chapter which sets out some guidelines, though these are not consistently used through the book to justify their presence here. He notes that humans are, in effect, islands, homes to vast swarms of bacteria, which can be characterized as neither good nor bad, but as essential to life as we know it. He also introduces the idea that geological time is very long--he's definitely influenced by Darwin and evolutionary biologists, and wants to root the book in its tropes, though they are not really necessary.The second body chapter then introduces us to the idea that various people have looked at microbes over the centuries, to differing ends. He starts with Leeuwenhoek, who was probably the first human to see microbes. But his research into bacteria and similar creatures was never really transformative. He then jumps to the nineteenth century when Pasteur and Koch and the rest put germ theory in place. This was the beginning of what remains the dominant way of looking at microbes.The rest of the chapter then introduces us to the more recent view, which he dates back to the late 1960s with the discovery of a whole new branch of life, the archaebacteria, and then expands to the surveys of microbial life that took off after that. There's a sense that microbiology of the 197os was a lot like American vertebrate biology of the 1900s-1920s, with intensive surveys to characterize most of the major groups and define their geological distribution.This is also the section when Yong could have made a stake for a particular kind of order to the rest of the book, but opted against it. Given that there is a generational element to the story, Yong could have characterized the various schools of microbiology that took shape during this time and given an overview of the people who were involved. Something like what William Leach did with ""The Butterfly People."" If nothing else, it would have helped to make sense of the on-coming chapters, with its huge cast of characters, some recurring, some connected, but the network never quite clear.Instead, what he wants to do is offer a history of ideas--which could work. That's what Darwin did, after all, showing the various ideas that fall under the overarching umbrella, and how they connect. And it is possible to see this, though it is never quite laid out clearly. Part of that is because, for all the introductory matter, the book is never introduced in any but the most general terms. Part of the reason is because the chapter titles are jokey, and so not quite explanatory.Here, though, is a précis of the argument. (It's worth noting that Darwin had expanded chapter explanations in his table of contents, effectively working as a rudimentary index.)Chapter 3. Microbes help build body. Vital functions have been outsourced because microbes are so ubiquitous.Chapter 4. Reintroduces the idea that microbes are neither inherently good nor bad, and even pathological effects can result from certain conditions--in the same way that landscapes can support different kinds of living communities, depending upon their conditions.Chapter 5. Sickness, in people, other organisms, and entire ecosystems, can result from disruptions in the microbial flora. Chapter 6. Animals and their microbes co-evolved.Chapter 7. Because microbes can do so many functions, their coming together with certain organisms allows those organisms to expand into new niches relatively easily. Chapter 8. Genes can be transferred horizontally, from organism to organism.Chapters 9 and 10. The future, and the possibility of microbial engineering.The real reason, though, that it is so difficult to parse out the overall narrative arc is that Yong is in love with the smaller-scale stories. He has been a blogger and writer of magazine articles for many years now, and this experience shows here--to the detriment of the book, I think. With the exception of a few, the chapters do not really lay out a cohesive arguments, but are divided by stories. Again and again, just as Yong is building up to a point, he will take a break and start a new story--with new characters and new creatures.In short, the ideas that are supposed to be driving the story are pushed aside for the story of people. And in the end, the narrative falls between two stools, neither fully the laying out of an idea, nor a group biography, but something in between, and fractured.Apart from making it hard to develop much momentum and to see the forest for the trees, this fragmenting of the book ends up bringing up a whole host of questions that Yong can never really address. Does it matter that one researcher is far from home when she meets with him? Why is another's son hitting Yong in the rear end? Does it matter when World War II was? Talk about conditions leading to (or foreclosing) disease ties into alternative notions of medicine--how does this change in view of microbes relate? Why do Westerners live in an environment that promotes inflammation? Aren't there neo-colonialist concerns with researchers sampling poop from malnourished children? What are the implications of engineering the microbial flora--haven't we learned from big ecological engineering projects?Popular science writing likes to emphasize the humans involved in the science, the work they do, the ideas they have, their personalities and quirks. I get it. But I think the tendency makes it harder to see what Yong is trying to say here. The book is not equipped to answer these questions, and the stories tend to obscure Yong's Darwinian ambitions.Still, he makes some valuable caveats and interventions. As anyone who only half pays attention to debates over nutrition will know, microbes are a big deal--probiotics make lots of money, people are all into feeding the right bugs, and one part of the whole fascination over gluten-free diets is concerns over leaky guts and microbes slipping into the bloodstream. Yong shows how limited the evidence for this talk is, though--particularly probiotics--and as soon as someone starts telling you the exact composition of microbe you need, you should be very wary.And, really, the stories are still fascinating. This last part is what most reviewers I've noticed have focused on, and they are not wrong. Yong got gold of a great subject, and hunted down a huge number of really interesting stories that fit the project. The amount of work that went into the book must have been immense.And, really, when you think of all those accomplishments, it seems churlish to complain that Yong wasn't Darwin also."

Inside our bodies and in our cells, we have even more interesting little microscopic monsters. Plus, we share these little bugs with everyone we meet, especially the people we live with. If you have a dog, the volume of bacteria in your home increases exponentially. If, gentle reader, you are now scratching and twitching, may I suggest getting a copy of 'I Contain Multitudes' so at least you will know how bacteria function, and why we have them in us, on us, and everywhere else. Author Ed Yong writes for the general reader, explaining that the majority of bacteria are helpful. Good thing, eh? My skin is still crawling. Literally. Anybody else feel like hitting the shower for a good scrub?Author Ed Yong humorously explores the microbiological universe we live in. Several chapters explain that bacteria were the first forms of life on Earth, at least as far as we know, by describing the historical record scientists have sussed out through DNA research. He delves into how some of the more interesting bacteria were discovered, and how scientists are currently exploring how bacteria can be used to improve health. Reader, it is obvious after finishing this book being a hypochondriac is an exercise in futility. If it makes you feel any better, most bacteria are our friends. The Earth would be just rock, water and gas fumes without 'em. So. Learn to love your little invisible pets. They certainly love you. You truly are never alone.'I Contain Multitudes' has an extensive Bibliography and an Index. I read the Kindle ebook, which collected the included photos in the back."
111,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"This book is jam-packed with tons of information about the recently uncovered world of microbes. Considering how many books about microbes are popping up, I was skeptical at first, but it quickly became apparent that this book was based on nothing but the best science available on the subject. Just like the Sonnenburgs' book Gut, I contain Multitudes focused on what we know about microbes and was very clear about the lack of evidence when speculating. The researchers cited by Yong are the best in their field. Who Yong *does not cite* is very telling. If you look for an author in Yong's citations (or in the Sonneburgs' citations) and that author is not there, do not trust their book at face value. You will notice that not one reputable microbe researcher and/or book author cites Grain Brain's Perlmutter, whose entire book is made up of misconceptions, sensational claims, and pseudoscience. Some of the most interesting parts of this book include: - Yong's very favorite microbe, Wolbachia, is a fairly magical creature. It is too big to fit into sperm and be passed down through the generations. It can only be carried in eggs. So what is Wolbachia to do if it wants to survive and pass down its genes? Well, it must ensure that as many females as possible survive to carry on its line. Accordingly, it controls the sex of many species as possible (especially arthropods). It either kills the males or alters them in some way to help itself spread through the population. Wolbachia stop female wasps from mating with males. When infected with Wolbachia, the females choose to clone instead. But, if you give the females an antibiotic to wipe out Wolbachia, they begin having sex with males again.In woodlice, Wolbachia interfere with the production of male hormones, ensuring that all woodlice are female or that male woodlice transformed into females. In Blue Moon butterflies Wolbachia kill male embryos, resulting in females outnumbering males by 100 to 1.In other species still, Wolbachia alter sperm in males so that they can only fertilize eggs infected with Wolbachia. (brilliant)Wolbachia is insanely successful, with infections rates often at 100% of the population. The majority of living creatures are arthropods, and 40% of arthropods are infected.- Once it was thought that no microbes could survive conditions at deep ocean vents. However, researchers found myriad forms of life at the vents. There is a worm that has no mouth or anus. To take in nutrients and expel waste products, these worms use the microbes that fill up their bodies. The microbes turn sulfur into the energy (what amazing alchemists!) that maintain the life of the worms, who live without the direct energy of sunlight. - Breastmilk is not for babies. It is to feed the microbes inside babies that are essential for baby's wellbeing and feed the viruses inside babies (the very viruses that make baby sick). - There are no good or bad microbes (this part was simply fantastic). In one species a microbe can be helpful and ""bad"" in another species who it harms. Even in the same individual, microbes are not good or bad. For example, gut bacteria is great.... in the gut. But if it travels to the blood, you have sepsis and die. The bacteria that caused the sepsis isn't ""bad."" It is simply in the wrong place to do its job. When in the blood, it does the same job it does in the intestine, but that is good for the functioning of the gut (and the parts of the body governed by gut microbes) is bad for the bloodstream. Sprinkled throughout the book was the message that, in nature, moderation is key. When is it good to wipe out all microbes? When is it not? How can we know what types of microbes (and at what concentration) are good for which circumstances. - Herbivores have the highest diversity of gut microbes, omnivores had second highest, and carnivores the lowest. Why should this be? Shouldn't animals that eat both plants and animals have more diverse microbes than an animal that only eats plants? Animals that eat only plants need the greatest variety of microbes because it takes tons of enzymes to break down plants but not nearly as much to break down animals. Plants have lot of cellulose and carbs, which are hard to break down. So plant eaters need microbes in great diversity and abundance to accomplish that task.It's funny, but you can think of herbivores as actual mouths. They do the eating of the plant. Their superior microbes break down the plants (just as a mouth and teeth break down food so you can swallow and digest it). Another animal, an omnivore or carnivore, comes along and eats what has essentially already been chewed and broken down. When the omnivore or carnivore eat the herbivore, they have saved themselves the work of breaking down the food. It's done for them. They merely chew it up some more to break it into small enough pieces so their intestine, which has far fewer microbes, can relax and just finish the job of digesting the plants (which hold the sun's energy!) that the herbivore and its microbes already did the hard work of breaking down. Yong gave many excellent examples of various strategies different animals species used for helping guts and microbes work in tandem to digest food. "
112,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"You may think that we are just made from muscles, blood cells, bones and a fair bit of DNA, but in between the gaps are microbes. Billions and billions of them. There are the odd rogue ones, but most of them are useful and make up an essential element of our being. Without them we could not live. They help us in countless ways, sculpting our organs, protecting us from disease and feeding and nourishing us; our gut contains a complete ecosystem that ensure that we extract all the energy we need.Microbes work equal miracles in other animals too, providing the ethereal light that disguises a squid as they hunt, ensuring that koalas are able to digest the unpalatable eucalyptus leaves and the weevil that uses bacteria to make its shell before killing them. The modern worldview of eliminating all microbes is causing as much harm as it is good; people nowdays have a revulsion of all things bacterial, hence the raft of cleaning products that are designed to scour all surfaces and hands clean of these unwanted intruders. However, as Yong successfully argues in this book that not only we might be missing a trick, but our bacterial ecosystem is essential for our survival. A good example of this is in hospitals; the modern view is that all windows have to be locked shut to keep rogue microbes out, but the effect of this is that patients sit in their beds stewing in a lethal mix of micro-organisms. This hazardous situation can be simply solved by opening a window, this allows the dispersal and dilution of the potentially lethal ones. Simple, but very effective.It is a fascinating account of the unseen creatures that live within and all around us. Yong takes us on this journey through the microscope to discover the most recent research from scientists all round the world and tell us of the secrets that are being discovered about microbes. Some of the treatments being developed have the potential to make people’s so lives much better; one example is RePOOpulate – as unappealing as it sounds! However, this treatment has worked miracles with a 94% success rate and no side effects, a success rate not seen in many other cures. Yong writes with an engaging and eloquent style and makes the science in here really accessible. Well worth reading. 4.5 stars."
113,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"Ed Yong is a London-based science writer for The Atlantic and is part of National Geographic’s blogging network. I had trouble believing that I Contain Multitudes is his first book; it’s so fluent and engaging that it immediately draws you into the microbial world and keeps you marveling at its strange yet fascinating workings. Yong writes like a journalist rather than a scientist, and that’s a good thing: with an eye to the average reader, he uses a variety of examples and metaphors, intersperses personal anecdotes of visiting researchers at their labs or in the field, and is careful to recap important facts in a lucid way.The book opens with a visit to San Diego Zoo (see the exclusive extract following my review), where we meet Baba the pangolin. But “Baba is not just a pangolin. He is also a teeming mass of microbes,” Yong explains. “Some of them live inside him, mostly in his gut. Others live on the surface of his face, belly, paws, claws, and scales.” Believe it or not, but we are roughly half and half human cells and microbial cells, making each of us – like all creatures – more of an ecosystem (another term is “holobiont”) than a single entity.Microbes vary between species but also within species, so each individual’s microbiome in some ways reflects a unique mixture of genes and experiences. This is why people’s underarms smell subtly different, and how hyenas use their scent glands to convey messages. The microbiome may well be tailored to different creatures’ functions, so researchers at San Diego Zoo are testing swabs from their animals to see if there could be discernible signatures for burrowing or flying activities, or for disease. I was struck by the breadth of species considered here: not just mammals, but also invertebrates like beetles, cicadas, and squid – my entomologist husband would surely be proud. The “Us” in the subtitle is thus used very inclusively to speak of the way that microbes live in symbiosis with all living things.If I were to boil down Yong’s book to one message, it’s that microbes are not simply “bad” or “good” but have different roles depending on the context and the host. You can hardly dismiss all bacteria as germs that must be eradicated when there are thousands of benign species in your gut (versus fewer than 100 kinds that cause infectious diseases). If it weren’t for the microbes passed on to us at birth, we wouldn’t be able to digest the complex sugars in our mothers’ milk. Other creatures rely on bacteria to help them develop to adulthood, like the tube worms that thrive on Navy ship hulls at Pearl Harbor.Yet Yong feels too little attention is given to beneficial microbes, and in many cases we continue the campaign to rid ourselves of them through overuse of antibiotics and taking cleanliness to unhelpful extremes. “We have been tilting at microbes for too long, and created a world that’s hostile to the ones we need,” he asserts.The book is full of lines like that one that combine a nice turn of phrase and a clever literary allusion. In the title alone, after all, you have references to Walt Whitman (“I contain multitudes” is from his “Song of Myself”) and Charles Darwin (“there is grandeur in this view of life” is part of the closing sentence in his On the Origin of Species). Yong also sets up helpful analogies, comparing the immune system to a thermostat and antibiotics to “shock-and-awe weapons … like nuking a city to deal with a rat.”History and future are also brought together very effectively, with the narrative looking backwards to Leeuwenhoek’s early microscope work and Pasteur and Koch’s germ theory, but also forwards to the prospects that current research into microbes might enable: eliminating elephantiasis, protecting frogs from deadly fungi via probiotics in the soil, fecal microbiota transplants to cure C. diff infections, and so on.The possibilities seem endless, and this is a book that will keep you shaking your head in amazement. I’d liken Yong’s style to David Quammen’s or Rebecca Skloot’s. His clear and intriguing science writing succeeds in inspiring wonder at the natural world and at the bodies that carry us through it.I participated in the official Wellcome Book Prize 2017 blog tour. See my blog review at Bookish Beck for an exclusive extract from the book."
114,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"I Contain Multitudes is science writing at its best: Ed Yong is curious and energetic, and his enthusiasm for bacteria (and wordplay) runneth over in this wide-ranging look at microbiomes within and without. The Whitman-inspired title is apt: we drift through a world teeming with bacteria. Our nonhuman bacterial denizens number in the trillions, and like Pigpen from Peanuts we exude a cloud of our own making, aerosolizing some 37 million bacteria per hour. Yong is quick to dispel the oft-cited back-of-the-napkin calculation that bacterial cells outnumber human cells 10-to-1. The best recent estimates render that split more evenly: roughly 39 trillion microbial cells to 30 trillion [significantly larger] human cells. Still, the point remains that we are hybrid creatures. If there is one takeaway message, it is that bacteria have gotten a bad rap due to our fixation on pathogens. Fewer than 100 bacterial species cause infectious disease in humans, compared to thousands of species [in our guts alone] that range from harmless to essential. If bacteria were to suddenly disappear, life would come to a quick and crashing halt. We need bacteria to digest, to supplement nutrients, to fight infection, and to offload hosts of other responsibilities we are evolved to depend upon.While the book is chock full of interesting factoids (your right hand shares just a sixth of its microbial species with your left hand!) and canvasses the history of human discovery of the microscopic world, most information comes in the form of Yong's interactions with researchers. We learn about connections between bacteria and immunity, and potential developmental connections to autism and schizophrenia. We look at the ever-raging battle between farmers and parasites, and how bacteria can be wielded by aggressor and defender alike. There's a lot of information on the bacteria we inherit from our mothers as we pass through the birth canal, as well as the purpose of milk for a developing child (it feeds important bacteria as well as the baby). We witness tests with bacteria-free mice, swabbed zoo animals, gene sequencing, computer simulations, and various other methods of isolating the causes and effects of bacterial strains. We learn about commercial products that do and do not help (for example, probiotics make sense in theory, but the popular brands do either nothing at all or very little). We are shown the dangerous effects of overusing antibacterial products (themselves bi-products of bacterial warfare) and our misguided attempts to sanitize our environments [read: hospitals] completely. We learn the power of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to both explain much of evolutionary history, to blur the lines between species and genomes, and to give us a potential leg up against parasites. Yong chronicles some successful examples of engineering (such as infecting mosquitos with neutral Wolbachia to combat Dengue fever, or applying transplanted rumen to help Austalian livestock eat Leucaena without consequence), but also some of the ongoing problems like pine beetle forest destruction. We hold our noses while applauding the remarkable promise of fecal transplantation, especially for C-diff, and the ongoing work to address other conditions like IBS and colitis.Yong shares leading theories, discredited theories, promising research, ongoing debates, and a lot of the nuance you don't always get from popular science writing. He's a gifted communicator, and can't resist side commentary with a lot of juicy science and good sense. With each discovery, it becomes readily apparent that we've barely scratched the surface and that quick assumptions and preliminary results almost always mislead, giving way to deeper understanding with ongoing research. Further investigation into the bacterial world will result in exciting advancements in health, materials, food, and a variety of other fields. I hope many people read this and are inspired to join in on the discovery."

116,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32913415-laura,5," When Orson Welles said ""We're born alone, we live alone, we die alone"", he was mistaken. Even when we are alone, we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis--a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. Some animals are colonized by microbes while they are still unfertilized eggs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then proceed through our lives in their presence. When we eat, so do they. When we travel, they come along. When we die, they consume us. Every one of us is a zoo in our own right--a colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collective. An entire world. ~~microscopic view of bacteria on the human tongueEd Yong takes us into an absolutely fascinating world--the unseen world of microscopic life. These tiny life forms were first glimpsed by a Dutchman, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, who thought to look at a drop of water through his handmade lens in the 1660's. He went on to publish detailed drawings of his findings. They garnered him intense attention and fame, and he went on to become a Fellow of the Royal Society. However, he never taught anyone else how to make his superior lenses, and when he died...and his collection went missing...interest waned. But then came the late 1700's and Louis Pasteur. He, along with Robert Koch, did meticulous work showing that bacteria are responsible for diseases formerly attributed to ""bad air"". So microbes permanently entered the lime light, but have been cast, almost exclusively, as a villein. ""It didn't help that just before this wave of discoveries, in 1859, one Charles Darwin had published  On the Origin of Species . 'Through this historical accident, the germ theory of disease developed during the gory phase of Darwinism, where the interplay between living things was regarded as a struggle for survival, when one had to be friend or foe, with no quarter given,' wrote microbiologist Rene Dubos. 'This attitude molded, from the beginning, all later attempts to control microbial diseases. It led to a kind of aggressive warfare against the microbes, aimed at their elimination from the sick individual and the community."" I am, as a registered nurse, a product of this culture. We in modern medicine are proud of the largely successful warfare that we have waged against infectious disease. We've come a VERY long ways from the days in which surgeons, covered in gore, wiped their saw on their apron, and then moved on to their next victim/patient. We maintain meticulous sterile fields. We ""foam in/foam out"" to kill all microbes on our hands before touching patients. We autoclave equipment and sanitize hospital rooms. We prescribe antibiotics for true bacterial infections...and many infections that don't require these weapons. In short, we've solved giant disease and pestilence problems, prolonging human life by decades in the process, but created other issues. We're only now acknowledging the seriousness of these new issues, and the science behind why eradicating bacteria might not be such a good idea.Ed Yong, while not taking sides per se, nevertheless presents a plethora of evidence supporting the beneficial aspects of bacterial life. Yes, infectious disease is still a menace. Yes, antibiotics still save lives every day. However, most bacteria do not cause diseases (except in profoundly immunocompromised hosts), but they crowd out harmful pathogens on surfaces--kitchen counters as well as our skin, toilet seats as well as our guts. Overuse of antibacterial products not only promotes resistant strands of bacteria, it also kills the non-pathogenic organisms...leaving a vacuum that is filled by the most aggressive micro-organisms. But bacteria do far more than simply live on surfaces. They digest food that we can't digest ourselves, they allow squid to glow, they protect insects from predators, they provide the scent in glands which many different animals use to communicate, and they can block the malaria parasite from infecting mosquitoes. In fact, there is compelling evidence that chloroplasts and mitochondria are domesticated bacteria which now cannot live outside plant/animal cells. It would seem that the fate of animal/plant life and bacteria are entwined, for better or for worse. Yong shows ""the long waltz"" that our species have engaged in. Through natural selection bacteria evolve to better serve their hosts, and we (plants/animals) evolve to depend more and more on our bacterial companions. But while the four eukaryotic kingdoms (protists, fungi, plants, and animals) evolve at a rate that isn't particularly noticeable until many generations, bacteria can evolve at an amazingly rapid pace. They can evolve to allow rodents to eat plants that would otherwise be poisonous to them for example. This aspect of bacteria is fascinating to those in the biomed field--where researchers are hoping to discover new ways of combating diseases such as ulcerative colitis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. Far from being the enemy, many bacteria actually have the potential to save us.  My two cents : My above rambling review has barely scratched the surface how mind-blowing Yong's book is. Read this offering to see how complex and down right amazing our world is. Given 5 stars or a rating of ""Perfect"". Highly, highly recommended!!  Further Reading:  Here's a very good article from the National Institutes of Health on beneficial microbes--https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...~~Here's a fascinating look at the newest kingdom, Archaea, from the University of California, Berkley --https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/archaea/arc...~~A link to the University of Utah's page on the evolution of the cell...and an emerging theory of the origins of chloroplasts/mitochondria--https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/conte...~~Finally, H.G. Wells incorporated bacteria into the plot of his novel The War of the Worlds over 100 years ago. I *loved* his ending. But now, the part of me who finds sci-fi interesting has to ask, after reading  I Contain Multitudes , what if we (meaning plants/animals) have evolved to serve as walking vessels for bacteria? What if we serve them instead of the other way around? It's *ahem* food for thought. After all, new research shows that food cravings might be caused by the bacteria in our gut!"

118,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"“Forget Orson Welles, and heed Walt Whitman: “I am large, I contain multitudes.”“'Each animal is an ecosystem with legs,' says John Rawls.""“As palaeontologist Andrew Knoll once said, 'Animals might be evolution's icing, but bacteria are really the cake.'""Yep, Ed Yong knows how to salt and pepper his writing with some good quotes. He also pens some wonderful great-for-quoting prose himself: ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars.""“Within 24 hours of moving into a new place we overwrite it with our own microbes, turning it into a reflection of ourselves.”Yong is a great storyteller and gracefully covers a whole, er, host of topics. This is a broad-ranging book that still manages to go to fantastic depths (at which, by the way, there are many micro-organisms. Exremophiles in particular know how to go where no human has gone before, though we seem to be improving our methods of travel...)Imagine being the first person (known) to look at pond water through a microscope. You see critters moving all around and you think you're seeing things. You try again and again and star looking at all sorts of stuff. Anything you can think of. And almost everywhere you look, these little beings are zipping around. All of a sudden you realize there is a world of activity, an unknown world (or worlds) that has been there all along and their influence and importance is likely on a grand scale. It is kind of a complement to the realization that the earth revolves around the sun (i.e. it's not all about us) and that our solar system is just a few small dots in a vast network of galaxies.Yong follows the first known microscopist (to see microorganisms) into wonder and awe, and then death, and when he dies, Yong follows him back into obscurity (for one or two-hundred years?). And he brings us to the next wave of scientists studying these organisms. He talks of the theories over hundreds or thousands of years used to try to explain the work of microorganisms that was, at that point, invisible, and then brings us closer and closer to the present, as our understanding that microbes affect us grows and yet our comprehension of their intelligence, complexity and range of activity and influence often lags behind. Knowledge is anything but forward moving. There are people who lived thousands of years ago who knew much more about science than many people today. Mostly because people let inflexible (and in my experience, often dangerous) assumptions and ideologies get in the way of processes of learning and, perhaps more importantly, unlearning. For, in order to learn something new, to see something, even if is highy visible and evidence of it is incontrovertible, we often must let go of previously held notions. Yong's book is a testament to all the ways humans are wrong about things, and the endless specificity and self-importance of our vision that makes more omniscient forms of knowledge and wisdom impossible. We are always struggling to understand the world we live in, and we are often failing to see how powerful we are and yet how fallible, vulnerable and small. I wish I could write a better, more thorough review. I listened to this book on audio and I didn't take notes. Or, if I did, I cannot find them. But one of my favorite sections of the book was about worms. The work they do in the soil (and the long-term productivity of organic farming that works in collaboration with them), the revolutionary potential for use of worms to make waste management much more sustainable. And there was an interesting section on the microbiome/microbial communities in houses and hospitals as well as in the body. How trying to kill microbes is much more dangerous than trying to find a healthy balance of them. So much cool stuff in this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in illness and health (of self and community), in building balanced healthy ecosystems rather than trying to solve our problems by eradicating and flattening the communities of microbes in our midst. “Much of modern medicine is built upon the foundations that antibiotics provide, and those foundations are now crumbling.” Here is the list of chapters to give you a bit more of a sense of the trajectory:Living Islands (evolution of eukaryotes, a brief history of biological time)The People Who Thought To Look (Antony van Leeuwenhoek--early microscopists) Body Builders (and he's not talking about gyms.)Terms and Conditions Apply (our love affair with friendly microbes is not the kind of love that is unconditional. It is a lot of work to sustain healthy balances.)In Sickness And In HealthThe Long Waltz (how do symbiotic partnerships begin? How do they evolve?)Mutually Assured SuccessAllegro in E Major (microbes influence on the genome of other animals)Microbes A La Carte (trying to work with the microbiome to fight illness and create healthier body ecosystems)Tomorrow the World"

It is not the only literary reference and I truly appreciate that in a science writer.Yong gives the feeling of being on a safari, observing exotic wildlife. He makes single-celled organisms as interesting as wildebeest and lions. We have come a long way in understanding this part of the ecosystem, and we have miles to go before we perfect that knowledge.The microorganisms were here first. All of the multicellular animals & plants have evolved in concert with them and it should come as no surprise that we have vast colonies of microbes on us & in us. In fact, they are essential to our proper function—witness the microbe-free mice that researchers have created to experiment with these ideas. Their guts and immune systems don’t function properly and the animals don’t behave like normal animals either. Before reading this book, I had a much too simplistic view of the human microbiome. Now I know a number of the factors that can influence it (diet & antibiotics are only two of a long list) and that “good” bacteria can do bad things if the system is out of whack (dysbiosis, my new word for the month).Not to mention cool things like using bacterial infections to control mosquito-bourne diseases!Recommended reading."
120,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"You’ve got company. Carol Anne Freeling was certainly right when she said, “They’re hee-ur,” well maybe not enraged spirits, but there are certainly plenty of entities present to which we have paid insufficient attention. Maybe Regan MacNeil was closer to the mark in proclaiming “We are legion.” 
 When Orson Welles said “We’re born alone, we live alone, we die alone,” he was mistaken. Even when we are alone, we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis—a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. Some animals are colonized by microbes while they are still unfertilized eggs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then proceed through our lives in their presence.

An entire world. 
Trying to map what it is to be a physical human being, in something like the  Human Genome Project, is a daunting task. But our genes tell only part of our story, like a novel with a beginning and ending but no middle. That middle is taken up by the vast array of other life that exists within our bodies. While the guests we harbor may not necessarily be in league with Satan, they are a mixed lot. They mean us no harm, particularly, and we have evolved very workable symbiotic relationships with them, but they are not necessarily our friends either. They took up residence for their own benefit and will stick around and provide benefits to us only as long as we provide what they need, like that girl/boy friend you remember with gritted teeth.I won’t say this book will blow your mind, but this is your brainAnd it’s not even Mardi Gras – from the Brain Association of MississippiThis is your brain after reading this bookShame about that haircut[In the interest of full disclosure, it should be known that every day when my wife was reading this book, she would walk in the door and tell me of yet another thing she had read that had totally blown her mind. Not that my mind didn't go Ka-Boom when I read it. It certainly it. But hers was blown first. I only steal from the best. ]I Contain Multitudes will change how you understand not only the human body, but all the biota on the planet, hell, the universe. It will help you understand how it can happen that diseases like the flu can adapt so quickly to our latest attempts to stamp them out. It will help you understand why coral reefs are dying. It will give you some new words that help keep the new knowledge manageable. (My favorite is dysbiosis which is what it sounds like, a biological parallel to dystopia, with a hint of enforced disorganization.) It will expand your appreciation for how microbial biology works within people and in the world. It will offer you hope that there can be a future in which many of our maladies will not only be diagnosable, but will be treatable with the introduction of the right, specific probiotic. It will do your dishes and massage your feet. Well, ok, not the last two, but KABOOM, big new look-at-the-world stuff. Ok, you biologist types, pre-med, med, post med, anti-med, wearers of white lab coats, whatever the length, you know this stuff, at least I hope you do. But for most of the rest of us it is indeed a big change, a new layer of reality, well maybe not entirely new, but new enough to go KABOOM!Our intro to the world of which Yong writes, antibiotics, is probably akin to the one WW II bombadiers had through their bombsites. Amazing invention/discovery, antibiotics. They do a great job of wiping out pathogens, the nasties that make us ill, well, some of them anyway. Other harmful microbial types, the viral ones, roll their eyes at incoming antibiotics and keep on with what they are up to. However, as with items dropped from passing aircraft, the use of antibiotics entails considerable collateral damage, as the human body is a container for a vast array of microbial life. One might well envision millions of non-pathogenic residents shaking their fists as the incomings not only wipe out the harmful bugs, but vast numbers of the helpful ones as well. Ed Yong offers a more on-the-ground look, filling us in on what is actually going on inside, and how this part of what’s inside relates to that other part.If these folks can have an entire civilization inside a locker, just imagine what might develop in your liver or large intestine.If you don’t know who Ed Yong is, it’s a good bet that you will before too long. Yong is a popular science guy, a Neal DeGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Mary Roach, Jacques Cousteau, David Attenborough, Carl Sagan sort, a person who can take the wild, wonderful and fascinating things that are going on in the world of science and distill them all down for public consumption without making viewers’ or readers’ eyes glaze over, or listeners’ ears suddenly clog, without making you feel like an ill-educated dolt, and he accomplishes this with enough humor to produce a fair number of smiles and an occasional LOL. (Not in Mary Roach’s league for humor, but hey, who is?) He is an award-winning science writer at The Atlantic, whose work has appeared in a wide range of publications, from The New York Times to Nature, from The Guardian to Wired, from Slate to Scientific American, and on and on. He splits his time between London and DC, and I would not be at all surprised if he dashes back and forth in a TARDIS. I have provided links in EXTRA STUFF that will lead you down rabbit holes of fun material from Yong that may take you a while to leave.Ed Yong - From SpeakerpediaAmong the many surprises you will encounter here are a squid with its own high-beams, the microbial advantage of vaginal birth, the impact of gut microbes on mood, why a third of human milk is set aside for our guests (protection payments?), the relationship between the US Navy and mucus, why no man may be an island, but we may be archipelagos, and vats more. There is serious consideration given to how our relationships with this invisible world evolved:
…animals emerged in a world that had already been teeming with microbes for billions of years. They were the rulers of the planet long before we arrived. And when we did arrive, of course we evolved ways of interacting with the microbes around us. It would be absurd not to, like moving into a new city wearing a blindfold, earplugs, and a muzzle. Besides, microbes weren’t just unavoidable: they were useful. They fed the pioneering animals. Their presence also provided valuable cues to areas rich in nutrients, to temperatures conducive to life, or flat surfaces upon which to settle. By sensing these cues, pioneering animals gained valuable information about the world around them…hints of those ancient interactions still abound today.
 “It all depends.” As if life wasn’t complicated enough. Don’t you just love it when you are looking for help and the person you are asking responds with “It all depends.” And it really does, and it really will. What will be different, though, will be that your caregiver will have a much better idea than most caregivers can possibly have today. They will be able to look at a profile from a type of blood test and match potential solutions to the bacteria living in your gut, or wherever else in your two-legged bacteria condo might pertain. This knowledge is still in its infancy – at least a broad knowledge, but it is coming, and has the potential to make meaningful improvements in our health.
As microbiologist Patrice Cani told me, “The future will be a la carte.”And in this a la carte future, we won’t have to stop at picking the right bacteria for the job. Some scientists are picking the right genes for the job, and combining them into artisanal bacteria. Rather than just recruiting species with the right abilities, they are tinkering with the microbes themselves to endow them with new skills. 
Balance – from Explainxkcd.comThis raises some concerns, although they do not get a lot of attention here. If scientists can develop designer probiota to ameliorate suffering, there will always be evil-doers eager to use new technology to make designer biota intended to act as pathogens. In fact that is pretty much my sole gripe about this book. I wish more space had been devoted to the potential dangers of this advancing treatment modality. Just ask yourself, What would ISIS do?The title of Ed Yong’s book may not be up there with The Selfish Gene, Silent Spring, or Guns, Germs and Steel but what it lacks in snappy-ness it more than makes up for in content. This is a smart, readable explanation of one of the major ongoing scientific revolutions of our time. If you look deep inside yourself you will know that this is absolutely must-read material.

121,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"I feel like this book really exemplifies what I want from a science book written for a mass audience. It made everything really accessible and easy to understand without sacrificing on providing details or explanations. It provides a lot of citations so I can go look up the specific research papers and experiments mentioned that are of most interest to me, which I did. It also just connected research to larger ideas and theories for why things work the way they do. I think the whole point of science and the interest in it has to do with its ability to provide insight and answers into the why of things, at least for me. I also think Yong was really good about explaining the limitations of the research while also making the reader excited about where things could potentially go. Like I think it can be quite hard to straddle that line between talking about the exciting potential of something while also being clear that it might not go anywhere and that there's a lot of complexity and limitation in science. Also he mentioned one of my favorite books of all time, The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life, at the beginning so that automatically made me like the author a lot more. Anyways I really enjoyed this, I know I've been reading a lot of non-fiction so far this year, and this has definitely been one of the best ones so fat this year."
122,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,5,"For my entire hospital career I have worked in oncology, where I have been part of teams taking care of people with cancer. Frequently patients have “neutropenic fevers,” a condition considered to be potentially harmful and almost always requiring admission to the hospital. Neutrophils are those brave little white blood cells that go out into our bodies and do battle with all the nasty things our bodies are exposed to every day. Neutropenia means the patient has none of those cells to speak of (and this is why herd immunity and vaccines are important). We culture blood and urine, scan lungs, treat with antibiotics, and monitor for a few days to see if any microbes grow out in cultures. We teach people to fastidiously handwash, and avoid people who are sick. We make them wear masks in the hallways, in order to filter out airborne viruses. Their rooms have special filtration systems. We encourage them to make safe food choices, avoiding foods that can’t be washed or scrubbed clean, or might be undercooked. And you want to know the kicker? If these patients are infected, it’s usually because of microbes in their own body have run amok and caused infection.You know what else is in the hospital? Microbes. Tons of antibiotic-resistant microbes, hanging out in patient bodies and everywhere else. Once someone is cultured positive for these microbes, they stay on “isolation” for the duration of the visit--and sometimes for life in the case of microbes resistant to all antibiotics--in the (vain) hopes that staff, visitors and patients won’t go moving those resistant microbes around the hospital. A shift where I don’t where a yellow isolation gown to go into these rooms is pretty unusual.Yong made my little grey cells stretch and reach, and now I have yet more ways to think about microbes, and I dearly wish he would re-write this book–maybe in magazine form–every couple years so I can keep up with all the interesting research. Like David Quammen, Yong doesn’t just stick to one branch of research science; he wanders around many fields as he explores the impact microbes have made on us. He’ll first have you thinking about their sheer evolutionary weight (literally and figuratively), reminding us that we evolved in context of a microbe landscape, not the other way round (and some thought apes were a stretch). Like living on a planet where most of the water is saltwater, it makes sense that microbes would impact the evolution of life.Yong walks the reader through some of the science that show how animals evolved to use microbes (and perhaps vice versa?). Some are evolutionary, some genetic, some macro. There’s a lovely experiment where a glowing squid developed a sequestered area for those microbes–can’t set them free in the body, of course, so you have to create a special compartment.In other words, I highly recommend this book. It’s quite well researched and documented, with extensive citations. There’s a bibliography and index, for those that want to delve further or pick and choose. As a further note, I’ll say that I always appreciate researchers/writers who express appreciation for those they interview and follow, without being fawning, and Yong does a nice job with that as well. There are parts I really liked, parts I liked less, parts where someone should have trimmed his descriptive writing just a tad, but any book that keeps me thinking about it months later is a five star read.I’m going to put my detailed book report below page break at my wordpress site ( https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2019/...) with notes heavily on the medical and the ocean science. There’s also some interesting stuff about insects, for those who might lean that way, and trees."

The first associations are not symbiosis and better health but infection and disease because the negative image is over-represented. Hygiene and health are essential, but the benefits of invisible companions are far too rarely highlighted and the beneficial minis outweigh the pests by far. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms is necessary for good health, built on a microorganism friendly diet.Without a symbiosis with a few pounds of microorganisms that are spread over and through the whole body, human life would not be possible, metabolic processes would stop death would be inevitable. A co-evolution has made all higher living beings dependent on the colonizers because they defend humans against enemy invaders which could harm their host. Of course, they also assist with bodily functions because they bring benefits to them so that the motivation for the defense help is not purely altruistic. They form a second front against attackers and it are often the human eaters themselves who are to blame when they wreck their microflora and lose the second shield because of permanently unhealthy nom nom.The coevolution of higher life with invisible helpers is long and has usually developed into a symbiosis. Much has happened since the first bacterium settled in a higher being while it was itself being altered by a virus etc.The ever more severe human intervention in this cycle has led to problems within less than 75 years. Since the advent of antibiotics and serial mass production of drugs, allergies, food sensitivities, autoimmune diseases, multidrug-resistant germs, lifestyle diseases, etc. are on the rise. How much of this is related to the destruction of the natural balance in the body, can be difficult to estimate due to a lack of studies. A one-sided diet with an excessive intake of antibiotics in addition to various other drugs is an essential factor that turns the symbiosis into a dysbiosis.Many drugs include, as a side effect, a mass extinction combined with a collapse of the miniaturized social order, civil wars and a lengthy reconstruction of it. With medicine and hygiene, much money can be made and as a result, super-pathogens grow in hospitals, while chemical gangs in the body of the patients decimate the defense forces of the body.Therapies with alternative and gentler drugs would be a new competitive and biological disinfectant and more expensive than artificial chemicals in the short term without including long-time costs. The patients pay for this with their health and sometimes life.The potential market with tailor-made probiotics and the manipulation and improvement of microfauna with genetically modified organisms is a future-oriented industry. As soon as enough bucks are made with conventional medicine, the Big Players will enter it. Until then it will be vilified and kept down.Actually the effort, according to the standards of medical economics, would not be responsible. Individualized medicine would have to first check the patients for potential vulnerabilities in their microbiome and then create a tailored therapy for them. A great alternative for rich people, but all others continue to receive the standard procedure of conventional treatment that kills friend and foe alike.If one eats microbe-hostile, one gets problems because a healthy, natural and balanced diet ensures a stable and robust micro-environment. Industrially highly processed and unhealthy food kills many of the little helpers and in their places settle less species-rich constellations, sometimes almost monocultures of dodgy creaturs. These not only damage health in addition to the unhealthy diet but also ensure that the desire for excessive and destructive gluttony with junk food never breaks off in the brain. Their interest in a steady supply is justified. A dietary change to fresh, low-fat, salt-reduced and sugar-free diets could significantly reduce their intake. Everyone has to make a choice themselves. Fit and peaceful armies that have lived and protected us for eons or, alternatively, mercenary junkie armies with dubious loyalty, prone to excesses and arson. One willingly lets them move around in the heartland until one loses control over them or they desert and begin dismantling oneself from within. Many times, a supposed protective power has in retrospect proved to be the worst enemy.The brain partakes at every meal and accordingly, the performance can be expanded or reduced. Not only the body feels sluggish after too much food, but the gray cells are overwhelmed too. It is not so much the energy used in digestion or the inertia that sets in with permanent overeating. Much more the fuel of the brain is of poor quality. In the car or an expensive machine, one would not pour substandard gasoline or cheap oil. This mentality does not apply to one's own body. From one-sided nutrition with inferior food of low quality less valuable substances can be extracted, which would be necessary for optimal brain function. One eats oneself dumb.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiota"
124,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten,5,"”The latest estimates suggest that we have around 30 trillion human cells and 39 trillion microbial ones – a roughly even split. Even these numbers are inexact, but that does not really matter: by any reckoning, we contain multitudes.”“Perhaps it is less that I contain multitudes and more that I am multitudes.”I realized, as I was reading this book, that I have not had antibiotics in over twenty-five years. When I shared that information with my friends, the reactions were anywhere from “Wow” to “that is impossible.” Those reactions indicated to me how overly reliant we have become on antibiotics to fight what we perceive to be bad microbes. Of course, antibiotics are indiscriminate in what they kill. They are definitely a kill-them-all-and-let-Odin-sort-them-out kind of killer. ”But antibiotics are shock-and-awe weapons. They kill the bacteria we want as well as those we don’t – an approach that’s like nuking a city to deal with a rat. We don’t even need to see the rat to begin the massacre: many antibiotics are prescribed needlessly to treat viral infections they have no hope of countering.”I don’t get sick very often, and when I do, I seem to get sick to a lesser extent than do other people who are suffering from the same malady. Lucky genetics or maybe I’ve got a well balanced microbiome. I grew up on a farm and was exposed to a lot of microbes, more than the average person. In fact, one of the problems that is plaguing the first world is the fact that a greater percentage of people are not exposed to animals, a great source of useful microbes, or even just the outdoors, where we encounter microbes, bad and good, that help us format a diverse microbiome. They live in concrete worlds that are beneficial to health in the short term, but bad for health in the long term. They don’t run a gauntlet of infectious diseases that actually make them more resilient to illnesses. Their immune systems lack experience and become jumpy, overreacting to allergies and other minor threats. I think we may discover that microbes hold the key to all of our health issues. Big Brother might be watching us go about our daily lives, but what about the control imposed by the Orwellian, brainless, single-cell organisms inside of us? What we eat may not always be our idea. I’ve always been a bit wary of being manipulated by my own hormones, but what if I’m being manipulated by the microbes in my digestive tract as to what foods I like? ”Different microbes fare better on certain diets. Some are peerless at digesting plant fibres. Others thrive on fats. When you choose your meals, you are also choosing which bacteria get fed, and which get an advantage over their peers. But they don’t have to sit there and graciously await your decision. As we have seen, bacteria have ways of hacking into the nervous system. If they released dopamine, a chemical involved in feelings of pleasure and reward, when you ate the ‘right’ things, could they potentially train you to choose certain foods over others? Do they get a say in your menu picks?”So lean people have different levels of certain microbes in their digestive tract than overweight people. They tend to have a more balanced diet, heavy in veggies and fruits. Wonderful news, right? So to lose weight, all we have to do is take microbes from lean people and put them in overweight people. If only it were that easy. The problem is, those lean, mean producing microbes need to eat, so if the overweight person doesn’t change his diet and feed those microbes what they want to eat, they starve. This is, of course, an oversimplification of all the issues that go into trying to improve or change a microbiome, but the possibilities, with further research, are encouraging. I know we all want the magic pill that doesn’t require us to change our lifestyle or food choices, but what if your food preferences are being dictated by a microbe that has hijacked your nervous system to manipulate you into feeding it what it wants? That to me is sort of like being possessed by a demon. “‘America is a constipated nation,’ he said, indelicately. ‘If you pass small stools, you have big hospitals.’” If I miss a day not passing a bowel movement, I get annoyed. I like it when my intestinal tract is working like a well-oiled machine. I want the outgoing to keep up with the incoming. Nothing makes me feel less healthy than to think of BM hanging out in my intestinal tract any longer than it has to. When my digestive tract is working the way I want it to, it is operating to the theme song of Rawhide.
”Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'RawhideShe rollin', rollin', rollin'Though the streams are swollenKeep them doggies rollin', rawhideThrough rain an' wind an' weatherHellbent for leatherMove 'em on, head 'em upHead 'em up, move 'em onMove 'em on, head 'em upRawhide.”
 We are coming out of an era where we were convinced that any microbe was a bad microbe and finally are starting to embrace the idea that some microbes are not only good for us but essential. We pick up microbes from the people around us, and some of those microbes get added to our microbiome. I was reading this article, titled Your Partner could affect Your Microbiome, about a study conducted on heterosexual couples to see how much influence each had on the other’s microbiome. ”After testing the samples, the researchers noted that microbes had been swapped between couples to a significant enough extent that computer algorithms were able to link a person to their partner with an accuracy of 86 percent.” Makes me wonder about the 14%: so how much interaction do you have with your partner? The next thought, of course, is to think about the fact that your partner also brings with her the microbes received from past partners, and now those microbes have been shared with you. *Shudder* It is probably best not to think about it. I came away from reading this book thinking that microbes might provide solutions to many health issues that have plagued us for generations, such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and autoimmune disorders. Microbes have the ability to adapt and borrow from other microbes and change their makeup and purpose. The possibilities are, therefore, endless for us to find elusive cures hidden right in the microscopic multitudes within us. We have used microbes to dengue-fever proof mosquitoes and to save skin infected frogs from Amphibiageddon. My question is, can we use some of those breakthroughs to save the bees and potentially even the human race? The sky's the limit, and only with the very recent change in mindset about microbes have we begun to explore the potential. We have one great advantage…we know microbes exist! So take care of your microbiome, and start by reading this fascinating book. You will look at the world you can’t see with microscopic eyes.

125,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,0,"Update: Antibiotics and obesity. It is routine in the US (although banned in the UK and Canada) to give cows, pigs, chickens etc low doses of antibiotics in order to fatten them up. No one knows why the antibiotics make them gain weight on the same amount of food, but they do. There is no reason to suppose that we are any different. The mechanism has to do with altering the biome, the microbes in the body, but how long the effect lasts isn't known, it might be a lifetime thing.Antibiotics and resistance. We are told that we are overprescribed antibiotics and that is causing resistance, but the amount of antibiotics any individual gets is absolutely minor compared to the amount that we consume. Not only consume from meat, but since animal droppings are used for fertilizer, perhaps from our bread and vegetables and water too. It reminds me of recycling and the emphasis on all of us individuals doing it. However, 98% of all waste is industrial, retail and from restaurants. Go to many supermarkets and they charge you for a plastic bag (if they even have them), go to a 'green' supermarket like Whole Foods and they give a paper one. Then look at the produce, it's packed in plastic, the meat is in styrofoam, the deli salads in plastic, the knife and fork you got to eat them with are plastic, the coffe cup (recyclable!) has a plastic lid, the bottle of juice is probably plastic but the straw is paper. Plastic is cheap and convenient, clean, easy to store and keeps things fresh. Why change if you can make people feel they are the problem and that you are helping them to do the right thing? It's just clever marketing. They are the 98% of the problem and until they address the issues of pollution and climate change in their own industries and stores, no matter how hard we try, we will only make ... 2% of a difference.____________________Schizophrenia used to be blamed on cold mothers, autism likewise, it was the mother's fault. We've moved on now to proving it is the mother getting flu or measles (why didn't she get vaccinated, oh how could she do this and risk inflicting her child.... dadadada. Oh no she couldnt' get vaccinated because that causes.... dadadada).   ""Patterson had read that pregnant women who incur serious infections, like flu or measles, are more likely to have kids with autism and schizophrenia. He thought that a mother's immune responses might somehow affect the development of her baby's brain. He just didn't know how."".......... ""And they realised that Patterson's mice had gut problems in common with actual autistic children: both were likely to have diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal disorders, and both harboured unusual comunities of gut bicrobes. Perhaps, the duo reasoned, fixing those gut problems might also lead to changes in behaviour."" And so it goes on, these male scientists keen to prove that these links to lab mice proved the mother caused autism in her babies. Until, science writer, a woman, Emily Willingham points out that, 
""Mice don't have autism, which is a human neurobiological construct shaped in part by social and cultural perceptions of what is considered normal. Is a mouse repeatedly burying a marble really like a child rocking back and forth? Is a lower frequency of squeaks the same as being unable to talk to other people? If you squint just so, the similarities jump out . Look again and and you might see parallels with other conditions. 
Then the killer - the lab mice used were originally bred to model schizophrenia. So you have scientists saying that the bacteria in the guts of autistic babies and schizophrenic mice who cannot possibly be bred in any way to be autistic proves that it is the mother is responsible, it's just more time is needed to find the proof, the microbes responsible.It's scientific confirmation bias. It's akin to a scientific conspiracy theory. One way or another the mother must be blamed. And say, as the woman science writer says, that all these gut problems can be seen as not just similarities but absolute parallels to other conditions, not autism ."
126,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40898015-jamie,5,"Well, I will never think of bacteria and archaea the same. I certainly have a newfound understanding of just how vital it is to every part of life. That microbes and bacteria have helped shape our planet for billions of years, down to every single flora and fauna; even all the oxygen we breath has come from bacteria. I also never really thought about the microbes that are constantly around us and even on me, or how many you are ""seeding"" to the world. That""every person aerosolises 37 million bacteria per hour"". And, if that isn't crazy enough, how about ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars"". To me, learning all of this was just simply incredible-the effortless symbiosis of microbes with the environment and with ourselves. I could go on and on about this book-so I will end with is, this is hands down one of my favorite science books. The ""science"" wasn't intimidating to read, as the author didn't assume you were already an expert on the subject. It wasn't dry either, and a few parts made me laugh. This book would be great for anyone who is interested in learning about the unseen world going on all around them. "
127,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a fascinating book about the microbes inside all of us, and inside other animals as well. Now, it is often said that there are ten times as many bacteria in our bodies as there are cells. This, it turns out, is probably an over-estimate; the number of bacteria is probably in the same ballpark as the number of cells. But still, that is a lot!This book goes into detail about the amazing partnerships--the symbioses--between microbes and large organisms, mostly animals and humans. Microbes are essential to digestion, to our immune systems, and many other functions.Every person has his own population of microbes, which can be different between individuals. And we spread our microbes around; every day we deposit 30 million of them by breathing, touching things, and by excretions.Most microbes are not harmful to humans. But the distinction between harmful and not harmful and helpful is not always crystal clear. Microbes in our guts help digestion, but if they escape into the blood stream they can be deadly. I really enjoyed learning how dengue can be prevented by infecting mosquitos with a common bacterium called Wolbachia.I learned all sorts of great things. For example, probiotic foods and supplements have not been proven to be effective. Also, toilets that are cleaned too often are more likely to be covered in bacteria. And, hospital rooms with closed windows contain more deadly microbes than the fresh air outside. Some scientists believe that microbes are responsible for obesity, and even for high blood pressure.This book is actually fun to read, filled with subtle humor, and extremely informative. This book is so well written, I must recommend it to everyone."
128,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84916113-somebunny-reads-phoenix,5,"I am Legion.  So, apparently human beings (and all beings in general) are just bags of bacteria and other microorganisms, and these fascinating fellas have always dominated the Earth, from the birth of life to present days: there are more bacteria in our guts than starts in our galaxy. Interesting, uh? I would say a wonderful topic for a wonderful book! I loved this book and found it extremely interesting for many reasons. First, because it was very well-written, and second because it opened my mind to the fascinating field of microbiology, which I'd never think it would be for interest for me (a linguist). This book literally opened a new door for me, and since starting this read I watched documentaries and collected all kinds of information on bacteria, virus, and microorganisms in general. For example, did you know that our body contains so many bacteria that there are roughly the same amount of human cells and bacteria cells inside it? Or that sponges are such simple animals and yet full of microbes that sometimes, if you look at a sponge under a microscope, you will barely be able to see the animal for the microbes that cover it? Or that there is such a thing as a poop transplant (Faecal Microbiota Transplant, or FMT), in which stool samples from one healthy individual are inserted into someone else's intestines to re-create a healthy microbe environment and thus fighting many digestion-related illnesses? This book was all extremely interesting, and I think it also contains two very important messages to always keep in mind: first (something that many people, but not all people, know), that not all microorganisms are bad, and some of them are not only fundamental to sustain life and normal functions of animals and plants, but can also be used to cure health conditions and preserve the environment. Our indiscriminate war against germs, overdoing with disinfectant and antibiotics, is both straightening bad bacteria and endangering good ones, with repercussions on our and our Planets's health. Second, that this field is one of the most futurist fields of science, and we'll probably see incredible developments in the future: the creation of medicines based on probiotics, bacteria artificially engineered to fight diseases; and, incidentally, we'll probably see a lot of this stuff in sci-fi. Of course, as the author himself points out, scientists always have the ambition to find a grand unified theory, a master equation which can elegantly explain our universe, and microbiology, with its recent discoveries on how our life on the Planet started (seriously, look it up or read about it in this book, it's fascinating), how microorganisms are intertwined with hosts in complex symbiotic relationships which can even affect genome, and how much we could potentially do/cure just using bacteria, is currently one of the most fashionable candidates. Without having to believe that bacteria is the solution to all our problems, from dying crops to saving the coral reef and solve both malnutrition and obesity, let alone eradicating lymphatic filariasis and dengue fever; we instead can and should try to educate ourselves more about the microcosm which thrives inside of us and inside the smallest of bugs, so that we can learn how to respect it and be aware of the danger those small little things can pose to us, but also us to them. Bacteria can get extinct too, and who knows how many good friends we used to have in our guts before we killed them and started getting irritable bowls! Save your friendly neighbour bacterium!!! "

This is especially true of our warm moist bodies - which are covered inside and out with microorganisms....and this is a good thing.Bacteria are on and in our bodiesIn fact our bodies are really an indivisible aggregate of 'our' tissues and organs....and the microbial world that makes its home there. Moreover this is true for every multicellular organism on Earth. The totality of microorganisms (and their parts) in/on our bodies is called our 'microbiome', and it's composed of myriad kinds of bacteria, viruses, archaea, snippets of microbial DNA, and other miniscule microbial fragments. This microbiome helps digest our food, produces vitamins and minerals, breaks down toxins and dangerous chemicals, guides our embryonic development, assists our immune system, probably influences our behavior, and so on. There are many kinds of microbes in the worldIn this entertaining and illuminating book, Yong touches on the evolution of microbes; the history of microbiology; symbiotic relationships among microbes; symbiosis between microbes and higher organisms; dysbiosis (unbalanced microbiomes that harm their hosts); how scientists study and identify microbiomes; research studies aimed at seeding hospitals and buildings with 'good microbes'; and much more.Symbiotic microbes provide nutrients for plantsHospitals are covered with microorganisms. Seeding hospitals with 'good microbes' might prevent 'bad microbes' from growing.Most people probably associate microbes with disease, and Yong provides some examples of pathogenic organisms. The vast majority of microbes are beneficial though, and I was fascinated to read about their varied roles in the world of living things. I've had a rather varied career and in a galaxy far away and long ago I got a degree in microbiology.....but this book has a lot of new and exciting information. I'll give examples of a few intriguing factoids gleaned from the book:1. We can improve our health by nurturing 'helpful' bacteria in our digestive system. Since fiber-loving bacteria are supposed to boost the immune system I added a LOT of fiber to my diet.....and I think I feel healthier already!! We need 'good microbes' in our stomach 2. Newborns are bathed in good microbes during vaginal delivery. Thus, infants born by caesarean section - lacking this initial 'seeding' - develop different microbiomes than vaginal babies. Breast-feeding also provides babies with an initial dose of beneficial microbes. 3. It's good for kids to have a dog because the pooch brings outdoor microbes into the home. Being exposed to a larger variety of microorganisms reduces the likelihood of getting allergies. 4. The author, Ed Yong, really likes the Hawaiian bobtail squid, which contains large colonies of luminous bacteria. Whenever Yong mentions this critter he calls it 'adorable.' (ha ha ha)Bacteria make squids luminous This tome covers a fascinating array of topics in an understandable - and sometimes humorous - fashion. I love this book and would recommend it to everyone.

130,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"Recently I've been hearing reports of miracle cures of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by use of fecal matter transplants. Also I've heard that some autoimmune diseases may be caused by environments that are too clean. Upon hearing these things the question that comes to my mind is, why this new found enthusiasm for microorganisms? We've known about bacteria since Louis Pasteur. So why all this new information about microbes as if it was something new? (Actually we learn in this book that Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered the prevalence of bacteria on all sorts of surfaces in the 1680s, but for unexplained reasons his findings were pretty much ignored for 200 years.) What I learned from this book is that the new technologies of gene sequencing and genomics has changed everything. Before gene sequencing careful study of microbes was limited to those that could be grown on a culture medium. With current tools it is possible to sequence every single gene in a sample from a skin flake, stream bed, or any environmental or body surface. Suddenly researchers were able to provide detailed descriptions of myriad microbiota (This book uses the term microbiome.)What scientists are learning is that the number, variety and prevalence of microorganisms exceeded all expectations. Combined with our understanding of evolution we now know that all of life has co-evolved within close contact with microbes. Consequently many functions of animal life are either dependent on, or aided and regulated by, microorganisms. Food digestion is a leading example of this. This book warns that current science is in the early phases of understanding microbiomes and that we shouldn't become too excited about spectacular claims made by probiotic manufacturers. However, I believe that the wording used by this book in some cases hypes things a bit too much. In particular I'm don't like the way this book makes the statement that, ""The majority of cells in our body are not human, they're microbes."" Technically that statement is true, but it is misleading. The statement is true regarding the number of cells, but not mass (i.e. weight). Only about 1 to 3 percent of the human body weight is from microbes located mostly in the gut. The reason for this disparity between mass and numbers of cells is that most human cells (e.g. muscle, fat, & blood cells) are larger and more massive than bacterial cells. The information I've explained above about the mass of human cells and bacterial cells is not explained in this book. The book simply makes the statement regarding the number of cells which I'm sure will lead some people to make the declarative statement, ""Did you know that most of the human body is made of bugs?""The book explains why we should think of bacteria and viruses as companions, not enemies. Our efforts at being antibacterial—killing all microbial growth—can sometimes provide an environment in which pathogens can proliferate. But there is one quotation in the book by a doctor that provided another perspective to consider. ""I've never seen anybody die from getting antibiotics, but I've seen some die from the lack of them.""Also, our immune system evolved in an environment of mild background contamination. Thus, our modern clean living environments may be a contributor to increased occurrences of some autoimmune ailments. But of course we all know that contaminated environments can cause disease. Perhaps, as we learn more about microbiomes we'll learn to get the level of contamination just right. This book provides a good overall discussion of the expanding knowledge and understanding of microbes.The following is a link to an excerpt from the book about ""when Leeuwenhoek discovered Microorganisms:http://www.delanceyplace.com/view-arc..."
131,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"I liked this book so I am giving it three stars. It is common knowledge today that everything and all of us are covered with microbes - that some are good and some are bad. Their number can be debated. We have in the past been fixated on getting rid of them. This has been to our detriment. It is clear we have gone too far. Antibiotics are good and necessary, but at the same time they must be used with care. In heedlessly wiping out microbes, we have created an environment where pathogens proliferate. This book is about the symbiosis we have with the microbes living on and in our bodies and in our environment. It is about our need to develop a harmonious relationship between us and them. The book begins with a rather long introduction. I wanted the book to get going; what we were being told was all too general. The introduction is followed by a chapter which focuses on the history of bacteriology, beginning with the Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's (1632 - 1723) development of the microscope. He was the first to observe and describe single celled organisms. The growth of microbiology is reviewed through a discussion of the discoveries of scientists such as Louis Pasteur, Élie Metchnikoff, Theodor Rosebury, René Dubos and others. Microbiologists one has heard of and others less well-known. After the historical review, the remainder of the book contains fascinating information on more contemporary studies, but there is no real structure to the presentation. First of all, the titles of the chapters do not clearly indicate what the chapter will be about. Here are four titles so you can see what I mean:-The Long Waltz-Mutually Assured Success-Allegro in E Major -Microbes à la CarteOn completion of a chapter I had learned a smattering of information, all of which I had found interesting, but what exactly that particular chapter was focused upon most often eluded me. Topics brought up in one chapter come up again in another. For me, when reading a non-fiction book on a topic where my own knowledge is weak, I need structure. There is a heavy use of acronyms and scientific abbreviations, which are explained once, but most often just once. The same is true of the scientific terms used for particular experimental procedures, chemical compounds and pathogens. You can read this book without in-depth previous knowledge, but the more you know before you pick it up the easier it will be to understand. It definitely helped me to have recently read The Gene: An Intimate History. Today scientists are sequencing the genes of the microbes around us. Bacteria readily swap genes, something which humans do not do, but our cells can integrate foreign genetic material from bacteria. It is important to stress that we are today only beginning to understand the symbiotic relationship between our cells and the microbes living in, on and around us. This book does not give definitive answers but indicates where the future may take us. Numerous studies are cited. Here follow examples of topics discussed - fecal transplants, probiotics, studies on the bacteria feeding sugars in breast milk, the beneficial qualities of vaginal microbes for babies’ health and gut microbes in preventing obesity and autoimmune diseases, the value of dogs in increasing the microbe diversity in our homes, the decimation of coral reefs, squid with luminous bacteria. The topics are many and not only about humans, but other flora and fauna too. The book provides a lot of really interesting information, but I wanted a better structure to it all.The audiobook is very well narrated by Charlie Anson. Clear and easy to follow. The narration I have given four stars."

He reveals the amazing variety of ways that microorganisms influence their multicellular counterparts. A properly balanced microbiome is not only critical to health, but can be essential to proper development, reproduction and survival. In essence we are one system with the many trillions of foreign organisms in our bodies. We rely on each other. Not that there is a clear cut line between beneficial and pathogenic, a single organism can be both depending on the circumstances. As Yong notes, the immune system is not just a defense against disease causing organisms, it is a manager of our microbiome, ideally operating to maximize its benefits and minimize its dangers.Yong offers numerous examples of the codependence of microbes and animals including humans. One example we can easily relate to concerns a mother’s milk. In human milk there are sugars called human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), over 200 different ones, yet infants are not able to digest them. However, there is a bacteria that eats it all up, Bifidobacterium longum infantis. In return it feeds short-chain fatty acids to the gut cells. B. infantis also helps these cells generate an adhesive to fill gaps between them and it promotes the cells’ manufacture of anti-inflammatory compounds. Not only that, B. infantis helps infant brains grow by producing the sialic acid they need. And there is more. B. infantis attracts some pathogens acting as a decoy preventing them from invading gut cells. This microbe earns its keep.We are familiar with the term symbiosis which applies to the relationship between the microbiome and humans. Endosymbiosis is a more exact description of that relationship since the microbes live in and on us. Yong uses the term dysbiosis to describe when that relationship goes awry, when there is a loss of balance between the microbiome and the immune system. Such an imbalance can contribute to illness and conditions such as nutritional deficiency, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, and many, many more. Unfortunately pinning down the exact constituents of the microbiome responsible is very difficult. Typically there is not one bad actor, but varying mixes of microbes that cause trouble and then only in people with particular genetics or circumstances. Think of your body as an ecosystem. One piece may go astray, but real trouble doesn’t show up until many pieces have been affected, making it exceedingly problematic to understand how the imbalance begins.Biologist Lynn Margulis, persevering in the face of intense criticism, became famous for making the evolutionary role of endosymbiosis credible. Today it is a widely accepted explanation for the mitochondria in our cells which came from a captured bacterium. She also came up with the word holobiant to describe a community of species that stay together throughout their lives including us and our microbiome. This concept can also be applied to genes. Biologists such as Richard Dawkins consider animals and other life forms to be vehicles for genes. Evolution operates to select genes. Their vehicles can change as needed. The genes in our microbiome directly influence our well-being and behavior. Shouldn’t they be considered a part of the set of genes being selected for in our evolution? In other words, the genes of the holobiant together determine the evolutionary vehicle. Consider the example Yong offers of two “species” of closely related flies. They were thought to be separate species. They never mated and they contained different microbiomes. But give them antibiotics and they will successfully mate. Microbes can change an animal’s smell and other factors that can determine mating preference. Eventually these two fly communities with different microbiomes will become distinct species if they never mate. Just as with these flies, it is our hologenome that may be deciding our future.Yong explores the therapeutic potential of changing our microbiome. We make a stab at this today with prebiotics, probiotics and fecal transplants. But to reliably tackle most conditions will require cocktails of bacteria properly proportioned to individual needs. These would require testing for efficacy and safety as would any medicine. We also need to think carefully about how antibiotics and antimicrobials affect the microbiome and the bacteria we encounter. As we begin the age of gene therapy, we can consider not only manipulating the bacteria in our microbiomes but their genes as well. Microbes can be much more easily engineered with genes than can animal cells. Bacteria exchange genes through horizontal transfer. They don’t have to inherit them but can readily pick them up from their neighbors. Thus genes from transient bacteria can get into your microbiome. Astounding, however, is the increasing evidence of bacterial gene horizontal transfer into animal cells. This is particularly true of insects which often have very intimate relationships with bacteria. How this happens needs to be explored. Throughout the book Yong relates example after example of the codependence of animals and bacteria. Bacteria can shape organ development, not only determine sex but change sex after it is established, stop or enable reproduction, stop or enable parasites, provide or block essential nutrients, eradicate or promote a species, decimate or protect a crop, alter the environment and much, much more. Yong makes the case that we need to consider our relationship with bacteria particularly our hologenome if we are to understand our health, our behavior and our future. We are at the beginning of a new appreciation of the role bacteria play in the world, what it means to be human, and new approaches to tackle disease as well as shape our minds and bodies."

I think at times, scienctific nonfiction swings one of two ways--over simplified, or overly pendantic. This book truly hit the sweet spot. It's accessible, gorgeously written, and incredibly informative and well-researched.In particular, I liked that Yong doesn't shy away from differing schools of thought. Microbiology as we know it today is still a relatively new science, and as such there are a LOT of different opinions. Yong engages with all of the these. The level of nuance within this book is astounding, and truly elevates it.I also REALLY appreciated that Yong doesn't assume you miraculously remembered every detail from earlier chapters. He would repeat meanings behind acronyms, descriptions of bacteria and cell functions, and a whole lot of other things. However, this never feels repetitive. He's succinct, but also recognizes that his readers might, by chapter 8, forget a line or two from chapter 1. I definitely recommend this!"
138,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50066399-diane-in-australia,4,"I did enjoy this book, but it didn't 'wow' me as much as some of the other reviewers. In fact, I started it awhile ago, and just got distracted by other books, and put it down ... which never happens, if I'm enthralled by a book. When I finally came back to it, I did learn a few things, and read a few things aloud to hubby, so, all-in-all I suppose it was a 'good read'.4 Stars = Outstanding. It definitely held my interest."
139,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17746077-joshua-buhs,4,"A fascinating topic poorly served by the conventions of popular science writing.Ed Yong's book is about microbes--bacteria, mostly, but also viruses and few other extremely small creatures--and how they live with other organisms--humans for the most part, with plenty of other animals, too, though no plants.It has Darwinian ambitions, announced in its subtitle: ""A Grander View of Life"" evokes Darwin's famous phrase closing the first edition of ""On the Origin of Species"": ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.""And it is there in the basic organizing principle of the book. Darwin followed the recommendation of the philosopher of science William Whewell that a good scientific theory account for a range of facts--he called this the ""consilience of induction."" Yong is out to conciliate some inducting, too--so to speak--setting out a view of the interactions between animals and microbes that is extensive.For the past one hundred and fifty or so years, microbes have been mostly seen in the light of germ theory: that is, they have been either classed ad pathological or of little interest. In the last four decades (or so), a new view has taken shape: that microbes are neither good nor bad. But they are ubiquitous. And they are *integral* to multicellular life. Some are pathological. Some perform vital functions. They form an entire ecosystem, one upon which life depends, but one that has been mostly ignored, mostly invisible.As I say, this is a great story, with very important repercussions. The details are fascinating, and Yong is great at explaining the complex interplay between microbes and multicellular organisms in easy to understand ways--that usually do not feel condescending. (I could've used a little less forced humor: de gustibus and all that, though.) Just dipping into the various chapters and reading the sections involves one in some remarkable bits of biology. The book, on the level of the sections, is genuinely fun.There are, of course, important sequelae to this line of thought. One set concerns how we are to live in the world when we know its expanded dimension. Food choices, medicine choices, standard questions about environmental protection--all become more complicated when we have to take microbiology into account. This ""grander view"" of life also calls into question traditional boundaries--between the self and the environment, between humans and other organisms. If bacteria help to build your immune system, what does that mean for ideas about the integrity of the body? If moods and behaviors are effected by gut flora, what does that mean about human will and determinism?Darwin's book was arranged unusually--though brilliantly, in its way. (Waiting twenty years to publish gives certain advantages!) He started with artificial selection, as something most people would understand. Then, in the next two chapters, showed how the elements of artificial selection were inherent in nature, too: one chapter explored natural variety, the other natural competition. Chapter four then tied these various strands together, showing how natural selection worked in nature as an analogue of artificial selection. The remainder of the book--to simplify matters--gathers together a host of facts that can all be explained by natural selection, from the geological record to what we would now call genetics.Yong's book does not work quite so well on the level of chapters. It's fine, but not quite as elegant. There are basically three introductory chapters: one is a prologue, which situates Yong at a zoo watching a scientist investigate the microbial flora on the body of a pangolin. He then moves to another introductory chapter which sets out some guidelines, though these are not consistently used through the book to justify their presence here. He notes that humans are, in effect, islands, homes to vast swarms of bacteria, which can be characterized as neither good nor bad, but as essential to life as we know it. He also introduces the idea that geological time is very long--he's definitely influenced by Darwin and evolutionary biologists, and wants to root the book in its tropes, though they are not really necessary.The second body chapter then introduces us to the idea that various people have looked at microbes over the centuries, to differing ends. He starts with Leeuwenhoek, who was probably the first human to see microbes. But his research into bacteria and similar creatures was never really transformative. He then jumps to the nineteenth century when Pasteur and Koch and the rest put germ theory in place. This was the beginning of what remains the dominant way of looking at microbes.The rest of the chapter then introduces us to the more recent view, which he dates back to the late 1960s with the discovery of a whole new branch of life, the archaebacteria, and then expands to the surveys of microbial life that took off after that. There's a sense that microbiology of the 197os was a lot like American vertebrate biology of the 1900s-1920s, with intensive surveys to characterize most of the major groups and define their geological distribution.This is also the section when Yong could have made a stake for a particular kind of order to the rest of the book, but opted against it. Given that there is a generational element to the story, Yong could have characterized the various schools of microbiology that took shape during this time and given an overview of the people who were involved. Something like what William Leach did with ""The Butterfly People."" If nothing else, it would have helped to make sense of the on-coming chapters, with its huge cast of characters, some recurring, some connected, but the network never quite clear.Instead, what he wants to do is offer a history of ideas--which could work. That's what Darwin did, after all, showing the various ideas that fall under the overarching umbrella, and how they connect. And it is possible to see this, though it is never quite laid out clearly. Part of that is because, for all the introductory matter, the book is never introduced in any but the most general terms. Part of the reason is because the chapter titles are jokey, and so not quite explanatory.Here, though, is a précis of the argument. (It's worth noting that Darwin had expanded chapter explanations in his table of contents, effectively working as a rudimentary index.)Chapter 3. Microbes help build body. Vital functions have been outsourced because microbes are so ubiquitous.Chapter 4. Reintroduces the idea that microbes are neither inherently good nor bad, and even pathological effects can result from certain conditions--in the same way that landscapes can support different kinds of living communities, depending upon their conditions.Chapter 5. Sickness, in people, other organisms, and entire ecosystems, can result from disruptions in the microbial flora. Chapter 6. Animals and their microbes co-evolved.Chapter 7. Because microbes can do so many functions, their coming together with certain organisms allows those organisms to expand into new niches relatively easily. Chapter 8. Genes can be transferred horizontally, from organism to organism.Chapters 9 and 10. The future, and the possibility of microbial engineering.The real reason, though, that it is so difficult to parse out the overall narrative arc is that Yong is in love with the smaller-scale stories. He has been a blogger and writer of magazine articles for many years now, and this experience shows here--to the detriment of the book, I think. With the exception of a few, the chapters do not really lay out a cohesive arguments, but are divided by stories. Again and again, just as Yong is building up to a point, he will take a break and start a new story--with new characters and new creatures.In short, the ideas that are supposed to be driving the story are pushed aside for the story of people. And in the end, the narrative falls between two stools, neither fully the laying out of an idea, nor a group biography, but something in between, and fractured.Apart from making it hard to develop much momentum and to see the forest for the trees, this fragmenting of the book ends up bringing up a whole host of questions that Yong can never really address. Does it matter that one researcher is far from home when she meets with him? Why is another's son hitting Yong in the rear end? Does it matter when World War II was? Talk about conditions leading to (or foreclosing) disease ties into alternative notions of medicine--how does this change in view of microbes relate? Why do Westerners live in an environment that promotes inflammation? Aren't there neo-colonialist concerns with researchers sampling poop from malnourished children? What are the implications of engineering the microbial flora--haven't we learned from big ecological engineering projects?Popular science writing likes to emphasize the humans involved in the science, the work they do, the ideas they have, their personalities and quirks. I get it. But I think the tendency makes it harder to see what Yong is trying to say here. The book is not equipped to answer these questions, and the stories tend to obscure Yong's Darwinian ambitions.Still, he makes some valuable caveats and interventions. As anyone who only half pays attention to debates over nutrition will know, microbes are a big deal--probiotics make lots of money, people are all into feeding the right bugs, and one part of the whole fascination over gluten-free diets is concerns over leaky guts and microbes slipping into the bloodstream. Yong shows how limited the evidence for this talk is, though--particularly probiotics--and as soon as someone starts telling you the exact composition of microbe you need, you should be very wary.And, really, the stories are still fascinating. This last part is what most reviewers I've noticed have focused on, and they are not wrong. Yong got gold of a great subject, and hunted down a huge number of really interesting stories that fit the project. The amount of work that went into the book must have been immense.And, really, when you think of all those accomplishments, it seems churlish to complain that Yong wasn't Darwin also."
140,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"This is a fun read!Each one of us is a microbiome, with billions of bacteria literally on every bit of our skin and hair. Inside our bodies and in our cells, we have even more interesting little microscopic monsters. Plus, we share these little bugs with everyone we meet, especially the people we live with. If you have a dog, the volume of bacteria in your home increases exponentially. If, gentle reader, you are now scratching and twitching, may I suggest getting a copy of 'I Contain Multitudes' so at least you will know how bacteria function, and why we have them in us, on us, and everywhere else. Author Ed Yong writes for the general reader, explaining that the majority of bacteria are helpful. Good thing, eh? My skin is still crawling. Literally. Anybody else feel like hitting the shower for a good scrub?Author Ed Yong humorously explores the microbiological universe we live in. Several chapters explain that bacteria were the first forms of life on Earth, at least as far as we know, by describing the historical record scientists have sussed out through DNA research. He delves into how some of the more interesting bacteria were discovered, and how scientists are currently exploring how bacteria can be used to improve health. Reader, it is obvious after finishing this book being a hypochondriac is an exercise in futility. If it makes you feel any better, most bacteria are our friends. The Earth would be just rock, water and gas fumes without 'em. So. Learn to love your little invisible pets. They certainly love you. You truly are never alone.'I Contain Multitudes' has an extensive Bibliography and an Index. I read the Kindle ebook, which collected the included photos in the back."
141,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"This book is jam-packed with tons of information about the recently uncovered world of microbes. Considering how many books about microbes are popping up, I was skeptical at first, but it quickly became apparent that this book was based on nothing but the best science available on the subject. Just like the Sonnenburgs' book Gut, I contain Multitudes focused on what we know about microbes and was very clear about the lack of evidence when speculating. The researchers cited by Yong are the best in their field. Who Yong *does not cite* is very telling. If you look for an author in Yong's citations (or in the Sonneburgs' citations) and that author is not there, do not trust their book at face value. You will notice that not one reputable microbe researcher and/or book author cites Grain Brain's Perlmutter, whose entire book is made up of misconceptions, sensational claims, and pseudoscience. Some of the most interesting parts of this book include: - Yong's very favorite microbe, Wolbachia, is a fairly magical creature. It is too big to fit into sperm and be passed down through the generations. It can only be carried in eggs. So what is Wolbachia to do if it wants to survive and pass down its genes? Well, it must ensure that as many females as possible survive to carry on its line. Accordingly, it controls the sex of many species as possible (especially arthropods). It either kills the males or alters them in some way to help itself spread through the population. Wolbachia stop female wasps from mating with males. When infected with Wolbachia, the females choose to clone instead. But, if you give the females an antibiotic to wipe out Wolbachia, they begin having sex with males again.In woodlice, Wolbachia interfere with the production of male hormones, ensuring that all woodlice are female or that male woodlice transformed into females. In Blue Moon butterflies Wolbachia kill male embryos, resulting in females outnumbering males by 100 to 1.In other species still, Wolbachia alter sperm in males so that they can only fertilize eggs infected with Wolbachia. (brilliant)Wolbachia is insanely successful, with infections rates often at 100% of the population. The majority of living creatures are arthropods, and 40% of arthropods are infected.- Once it was thought that no microbes could survive conditions at deep ocean vents. However, researchers found myriad forms of life at the vents. There is a worm that has no mouth or anus. To take in nutrients and expel waste products, these worms use the microbes that fill up their bodies. The microbes turn sulfur into the energy (what amazing alchemists!) that maintain the life of the worms, who live without the direct energy of sunlight. - Breastmilk is not for babies. It is to feed the microbes inside babies that are essential for baby's wellbeing and feed the viruses inside babies (the very viruses that make baby sick). - There are no good or bad microbes (this part was simply fantastic). In one species a microbe can be helpful and ""bad"" in another species who it harms. Even in the same individual, microbes are not good or bad. For example, gut bacteria is great.... in the gut. But if it travels to the blood, you have sepsis and die. The bacteria that caused the sepsis isn't ""bad."" It is simply in the wrong place to do its job. When in the blood, it does the same job it does in the intestine, but that is good for the functioning of the gut (and the parts of the body governed by gut microbes) is bad for the bloodstream. Sprinkled throughout the book was the message that, in nature, moderation is key. When is it good to wipe out all microbes? When is it not? How can we know what types of microbes (and at what concentration) are good for which circumstances. - Herbivores have the highest diversity of gut microbes, omnivores had second highest, and carnivores the lowest. Why should this be? Shouldn't animals that eat both plants and animals have more diverse microbes than an animal that only eats plants? Animals that eat only plants need the greatest variety of microbes because it takes tons of enzymes to break down plants but not nearly as much to break down animals. Plants have lot of cellulose and carbs, which are hard to break down. So plant eaters need microbes in great diversity and abundance to accomplish that task.It's funny, but you can think of herbivores as actual mouths. They do the eating of the plant. Their superior microbes break down the plants (just as a mouth and teeth break down food so you can swallow and digest it). Another animal, an omnivore or carnivore, comes along and eats what has essentially already been chewed and broken down. When the omnivore or carnivore eat the herbivore, they have saved themselves the work of breaking down the food. It's done for them. They merely chew it up some more to break it into small enough pieces so their intestine, which has far fewer microbes, can relax and just finish the job of digesting the plants (which hold the sun's energy!) that the herbivore and its microbes already did the hard work of breaking down. Yong gave many excellent examples of various strategies different animals species used for helping guts and microbes work in tandem to digest food. "
142,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"You may think that we are just made from muscles, blood cells, bones and a fair bit of DNA, but in between the gaps are microbes. Billions and billions of them. There are the odd rogue ones, but most of them are useful and make up an essential element of our being. Without them we could not live. They help us in countless ways, sculpting our organs, protecting us from disease and feeding and nourishing us; our gut contains a complete ecosystem that ensure that we extract all the energy we need.Microbes work equal miracles in other animals too, providing the ethereal light that disguises a squid as they hunt, ensuring that koalas are able to digest the unpalatable eucalyptus leaves and the weevil that uses bacteria to make its shell before killing them. The modern worldview of eliminating all microbes is causing as much harm as it is good; people nowdays have a revulsion of all things bacterial, hence the raft of cleaning products that are designed to scour all surfaces and hands clean of these unwanted intruders. However, as Yong successfully argues in this book that not only we might be missing a trick, but our bacterial ecosystem is essential for our survival. A good example of this is in hospitals; the modern view is that all windows have to be locked shut to keep rogue microbes out, but the effect of this is that patients sit in their beds stewing in a lethal mix of micro-organisms. This hazardous situation can be simply solved by opening a window, this allows the dispersal and dilution of the potentially lethal ones. Simple, but very effective.It is a fascinating account of the unseen creatures that live within and all around us. Yong takes us on this journey through the microscope to discover the most recent research from scientists all round the world and tell us of the secrets that are being discovered about microbes. Some of the treatments being developed have the potential to make people’s so lives much better; one example is RePOOpulate – as unappealing as it sounds! However, this treatment has worked miracles with a 94% success rate and no side effects, a success rate not seen in many other cures. Yong writes with an engaging and eloquent style and makes the science in here really accessible. Well worth reading. 4.5 stars."
143,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"Ed Yong is a London-based science writer for The Atlantic and is part of National Geographic’s blogging network. I had trouble believing that I Contain Multitudes is his first book; it’s so fluent and engaging that it immediately draws you into the microbial world and keeps you marveling at its strange yet fascinating workings. Yong writes like a journalist rather than a scientist, and that’s a good thing: with an eye to the average reader, he uses a variety of examples and metaphors, intersperses personal anecdotes of visiting researchers at their labs or in the field, and is careful to recap important facts in a lucid way.The book opens with a visit to San Diego Zoo (see the exclusive extract following my review), where we meet Baba the pangolin. But “Baba is not just a pangolin. He is also a teeming mass of microbes,” Yong explains. “Some of them live inside him, mostly in his gut. Others live on the surface of his face, belly, paws, claws, and scales.” Believe it or not, but we are roughly half and half human cells and microbial cells, making each of us – like all creatures – more of an ecosystem (another term is “holobiont”) than a single entity.Microbes vary between species but also within species, so each individual’s microbiome in some ways reflects a unique mixture of genes and experiences. This is why people’s underarms smell subtly different, and how hyenas use their scent glands to convey messages. The microbiome may well be tailored to different creatures’ functions, so researchers at San Diego Zoo are testing swabs from their animals to see if there could be discernible signatures for burrowing or flying activities, or for disease. I was struck by the breadth of species considered here: not just mammals, but also invertebrates like beetles, cicadas, and squid – my entomologist husband would surely be proud. The “Us” in the subtitle is thus used very inclusively to speak of the way that microbes live in symbiosis with all living things.If I were to boil down Yong’s book to one message, it’s that microbes are not simply “bad” or “good” but have different roles depending on the context and the host. You can hardly dismiss all bacteria as germs that must be eradicated when there are thousands of benign species in your gut (versus fewer than 100 kinds that cause infectious diseases). If it weren’t for the microbes passed on to us at birth, we wouldn’t be able to digest the complex sugars in our mothers’ milk. Other creatures rely on bacteria to help them develop to adulthood, like the tube worms that thrive on Navy ship hulls at Pearl Harbor.Yet Yong feels too little attention is given to beneficial microbes, and in many cases we continue the campaign to rid ourselves of them through overuse of antibiotics and taking cleanliness to unhelpful extremes. “We have been tilting at microbes for too long, and created a world that’s hostile to the ones we need,” he asserts.The book is full of lines like that one that combine a nice turn of phrase and a clever literary allusion. In the title alone, after all, you have references to Walt Whitman (“I contain multitudes” is from his “Song of Myself”) and Charles Darwin (“there is grandeur in this view of life” is part of the closing sentence in his On the Origin of Species). Yong also sets up helpful analogies, comparing the immune system to a thermostat and antibiotics to “shock-and-awe weapons … like nuking a city to deal with a rat.”History and future are also brought together very effectively, with the narrative looking backwards to Leeuwenhoek’s early microscope work and Pasteur and Koch’s germ theory, but also forwards to the prospects that current research into microbes might enable: eliminating elephantiasis, protecting frogs from deadly fungi via probiotics in the soil, fecal microbiota transplants to cure C. diff infections, and so on.The possibilities seem endless, and this is a book that will keep you shaking your head in amazement. I’d liken Yong’s style to David Quammen’s or Rebecca Skloot’s. His clear and intriguing science writing succeeds in inspiring wonder at the natural world and at the bodies that carry us through it.I participated in the official Wellcome Book Prize 2017 blog tour. See my blog review at Bookish Beck for an exclusive extract from the book."
144,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"I Contain Multitudes is science writing at its best: Ed Yong is curious and energetic, and his enthusiasm for bacteria (and wordplay) runneth over in this wide-ranging look at microbiomes within and without. The Whitman-inspired title is apt: we drift through a world teeming with bacteria. Our nonhuman bacterial denizens number in the trillions, and like Pigpen from Peanuts we exude a cloud of our own making, aerosolizing some 37 million bacteria per hour. Yong is quick to dispel the oft-cited back-of-the-napkin calculation that bacterial cells outnumber human cells 10-to-1. The best recent estimates render that split more evenly: roughly 39 trillion microbial cells to 30 trillion [significantly larger] human cells. Still, the point remains that we are hybrid creatures. If there is one takeaway message, it is that bacteria have gotten a bad rap due to our fixation on pathogens. Fewer than 100 bacterial species cause infectious disease in humans, compared to thousands of species [in our guts alone] that range from harmless to essential. If bacteria were to suddenly disappear, life would come to a quick and crashing halt. We need bacteria to digest, to supplement nutrients, to fight infection, and to offload hosts of other responsibilities we are evolved to depend upon.While the book is chock full of interesting factoids (your right hand shares just a sixth of its microbial species with your left hand!) and canvasses the history of human discovery of the microscopic world, most information comes in the form of Yong's interactions with researchers. We learn about connections between bacteria and immunity, and potential developmental connections to autism and schizophrenia. We look at the ever-raging battle between farmers and parasites, and how bacteria can be wielded by aggressor and defender alike. There's a lot of information on the bacteria we inherit from our mothers as we pass through the birth canal, as well as the purpose of milk for a developing child (it feeds important bacteria as well as the baby). We witness tests with bacteria-free mice, swabbed zoo animals, gene sequencing, computer simulations, and various other methods of isolating the causes and effects of bacterial strains. We learn about commercial products that do and do not help (for example, probiotics make sense in theory, but the popular brands do either nothing at all or very little). We are shown the dangerous effects of overusing antibacterial products (themselves bi-products of bacterial warfare) and our misguided attempts to sanitize our environments [read: hospitals] completely. We learn the power of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to both explain much of evolutionary history, to blur the lines between species and genomes, and to give us a potential leg up against parasites. Yong chronicles some successful examples of engineering (such as infecting mosquitos with neutral Wolbachia to combat Dengue fever, or applying transplanted rumen to help Austalian livestock eat Leucaena without consequence), but also some of the ongoing problems like pine beetle forest destruction. We hold our noses while applauding the remarkable promise of fecal transplantation, especially for C-diff, and the ongoing work to address other conditions like IBS and colitis.Yong shares leading theories, discredited theories, promising research, ongoing debates, and a lot of the nuance you don't always get from popular science writing. He's a gifted communicator, and can't resist side commentary with a lot of juicy science and good sense. With each discovery, it becomes readily apparent that we've barely scratched the surface and that quick assumptions and preliminary results almost always mislead, giving way to deeper understanding with ongoing research. Further investigation into the bacterial world will result in exciting advancements in health, materials, food, and a variety of other fields. I hope many people read this and are inspired to join in on the discovery."

146,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32913415-laura,5," When Orson Welles said ""We're born alone, we live alone, we die alone"", he was mistaken. Even when we are alone, we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis--a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. Some animals are colonized by microbes while they are still unfertilized eggs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then proceed through our lives in their presence. When we eat, so do they. When we travel, they come along. When we die, they consume us. Every one of us is a zoo in our own right--a colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collective. An entire world. ~~microscopic view of bacteria on the human tongueEd Yong takes us into an absolutely fascinating world--the unseen world of microscopic life. These tiny life forms were first glimpsed by a Dutchman, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, who thought to look at a drop of water through his handmade lens in the 1660's. He went on to publish detailed drawings of his findings. They garnered him intense attention and fame, and he went on to become a Fellow of the Royal Society. However, he never taught anyone else how to make his superior lenses, and when he died...and his collection went missing...interest waned. But then came the late 1700's and Louis Pasteur. He, along with Robert Koch, did meticulous work showing that bacteria are responsible for diseases formerly attributed to ""bad air"". So microbes permanently entered the lime light, but have been cast, almost exclusively, as a villein. ""It didn't help that just before this wave of discoveries, in 1859, one Charles Darwin had published  On the Origin of Species . 'Through this historical accident, the germ theory of disease developed during the gory phase of Darwinism, where the interplay between living things was regarded as a struggle for survival, when one had to be friend or foe, with no quarter given,' wrote microbiologist Rene Dubos. 'This attitude molded, from the beginning, all later attempts to control microbial diseases. It led to a kind of aggressive warfare against the microbes, aimed at their elimination from the sick individual and the community."" I am, as a registered nurse, a product of this culture. We in modern medicine are proud of the largely successful warfare that we have waged against infectious disease. We've come a VERY long ways from the days in which surgeons, covered in gore, wiped their saw on their apron, and then moved on to their next victim/patient. We maintain meticulous sterile fields. We ""foam in/foam out"" to kill all microbes on our hands before touching patients. We autoclave equipment and sanitize hospital rooms. We prescribe antibiotics for true bacterial infections...and many infections that don't require these weapons. In short, we've solved giant disease and pestilence problems, prolonging human life by decades in the process, but created other issues. We're only now acknowledging the seriousness of these new issues, and the science behind why eradicating bacteria might not be such a good idea.Ed Yong, while not taking sides per se, nevertheless presents a plethora of evidence supporting the beneficial aspects of bacterial life. Yes, infectious disease is still a menace. Yes, antibiotics still save lives every day. However, most bacteria do not cause diseases (except in profoundly immunocompromised hosts), but they crowd out harmful pathogens on surfaces--kitchen counters as well as our skin, toilet seats as well as our guts. Overuse of antibacterial products not only promotes resistant strands of bacteria, it also kills the non-pathogenic organisms...leaving a vacuum that is filled by the most aggressive micro-organisms. But bacteria do far more than simply live on surfaces. They digest food that we can't digest ourselves, they allow squid to glow, they protect insects from predators, they provide the scent in glands which many different animals use to communicate, and they can block the malaria parasite from infecting mosquitoes. In fact, there is compelling evidence that chloroplasts and mitochondria are domesticated bacteria which now cannot live outside plant/animal cells. It would seem that the fate of animal/plant life and bacteria are entwined, for better or for worse. Yong shows ""the long waltz"" that our species have engaged in. Through natural selection bacteria evolve to better serve their hosts, and we (plants/animals) evolve to depend more and more on our bacterial companions. But while the four eukaryotic kingdoms (protists, fungi, plants, and animals) evolve at a rate that isn't particularly noticeable until many generations, bacteria can evolve at an amazingly rapid pace. They can evolve to allow rodents to eat plants that would otherwise be poisonous to them for example. This aspect of bacteria is fascinating to those in the biomed field--where researchers are hoping to discover new ways of combating diseases such as ulcerative colitis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. Far from being the enemy, many bacteria actually have the potential to save us.  My two cents : My above rambling review has barely scratched the surface how mind-blowing Yong's book is. Read this offering to see how complex and down right amazing our world is. Given 5 stars or a rating of ""Perfect"". Highly, highly recommended!!  Further Reading:  Here's a very good article from the National Institutes of Health on beneficial microbes--https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...~~Here's a fascinating look at the newest kingdom, Archaea, from the University of California, Berkley --https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/archaea/arc...~~A link to the University of Utah's page on the evolution of the cell...and an emerging theory of the origins of chloroplasts/mitochondria--https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/conte...~~Finally, H.G. Wells incorporated bacteria into the plot of his novel The War of the Worlds over 100 years ago. I *loved* his ending. But now, the part of me who finds sci-fi interesting has to ask, after reading  I Contain Multitudes , what if we (meaning plants/animals) have evolved to serve as walking vessels for bacteria? What if we serve them instead of the other way around? It's *ahem* food for thought. After all, new research shows that food cravings might be caused by the bacteria in our gut!"

148,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"“Forget Orson Welles, and heed Walt Whitman: “I am large, I contain multitudes.”“'Each animal is an ecosystem with legs,' says John Rawls.""“As palaeontologist Andrew Knoll once said, 'Animals might be evolution's icing, but bacteria are really the cake.'""Yep, Ed Yong knows how to salt and pepper his writing with some good quotes. He also pens some wonderful great-for-quoting prose himself: ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars.""“Within 24 hours of moving into a new place we overwrite it with our own microbes, turning it into a reflection of ourselves.”Yong is a great storyteller and gracefully covers a whole, er, host of topics. This is a broad-ranging book that still manages to go to fantastic depths (at which, by the way, there are many micro-organisms. Exremophiles in particular know how to go where no human has gone before, though we seem to be improving our methods of travel...)Imagine being the first person (known) to look at pond water through a microscope. You see critters moving all around and you think you're seeing things. You try again and again and star looking at all sorts of stuff. Anything you can think of. And almost everywhere you look, these little beings are zipping around. All of a sudden you realize there is a world of activity, an unknown world (or worlds) that has been there all along and their influence and importance is likely on a grand scale. It is kind of a complement to the realization that the earth revolves around the sun (i.e. it's not all about us) and that our solar system is just a few small dots in a vast network of galaxies.Yong follows the first known microscopist (to see microorganisms) into wonder and awe, and then death, and when he dies, Yong follows him back into obscurity (for one or two-hundred years?). And he brings us to the next wave of scientists studying these organisms. He talks of the theories over hundreds or thousands of years used to try to explain the work of microorganisms that was, at that point, invisible, and then brings us closer and closer to the present, as our understanding that microbes affect us grows and yet our comprehension of their intelligence, complexity and range of activity and influence often lags behind. Knowledge is anything but forward moving. There are people who lived thousands of years ago who knew much more about science than many people today. Mostly because people let inflexible (and in my experience, often dangerous) assumptions and ideologies get in the way of processes of learning and, perhaps more importantly, unlearning. For, in order to learn something new, to see something, even if is highy visible and evidence of it is incontrovertible, we often must let go of previously held notions. Yong's book is a testament to all the ways humans are wrong about things, and the endless specificity and self-importance of our vision that makes more omniscient forms of knowledge and wisdom impossible. We are always struggling to understand the world we live in, and we are often failing to see how powerful we are and yet how fallible, vulnerable and small. I wish I could write a better, more thorough review. I listened to this book on audio and I didn't take notes. Or, if I did, I cannot find them. But one of my favorite sections of the book was about worms. The work they do in the soil (and the long-term productivity of organic farming that works in collaboration with them), the revolutionary potential for use of worms to make waste management much more sustainable. And there was an interesting section on the microbiome/microbial communities in houses and hospitals as well as in the body. How trying to kill microbes is much more dangerous than trying to find a healthy balance of them. So much cool stuff in this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in illness and health (of self and community), in building balanced healthy ecosystems rather than trying to solve our problems by eradicating and flattening the communities of microbes in our midst. “Much of modern medicine is built upon the foundations that antibiotics provide, and those foundations are now crumbling.” Here is the list of chapters to give you a bit more of a sense of the trajectory:Living Islands (evolution of eukaryotes, a brief history of biological time)The People Who Thought To Look (Antony van Leeuwenhoek--early microscopists) Body Builders (and he's not talking about gyms.)Terms and Conditions Apply (our love affair with friendly microbes is not the kind of love that is unconditional. It is a lot of work to sustain healthy balances.)In Sickness And In HealthThe Long Waltz (how do symbiotic partnerships begin? How do they evolve?)Mutually Assured SuccessAllegro in E Major (microbes influence on the genome of other animals)Microbes A La Carte (trying to work with the microbiome to fight illness and create healthier body ecosystems)Tomorrow the World"

It is not the only literary reference and I truly appreciate that in a science writer.Yong gives the feeling of being on a safari, observing exotic wildlife. He makes single-celled organisms as interesting as wildebeest and lions. We have come a long way in understanding this part of the ecosystem, and we have miles to go before we perfect that knowledge.The microorganisms were here first. All of the multicellular animals & plants have evolved in concert with them and it should come as no surprise that we have vast colonies of microbes on us & in us. In fact, they are essential to our proper function—witness the microbe-free mice that researchers have created to experiment with these ideas. Their guts and immune systems don’t function properly and the animals don’t behave like normal animals either. Before reading this book, I had a much too simplistic view of the human microbiome. Now I know a number of the factors that can influence it (diet & antibiotics are only two of a long list) and that “good” bacteria can do bad things if the system is out of whack (dysbiosis, my new word for the month).Not to mention cool things like using bacterial infections to control mosquito-bourne diseases!Recommended reading."
150,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"You’ve got company. Carol Anne Freeling was certainly right when she said, “They’re hee-ur,” well maybe not enraged spirits, but there are certainly plenty of entities present to which we have paid insufficient attention. Maybe Regan MacNeil was closer to the mark in proclaiming “We are legion.” 
 When Orson Welles said “We’re born alone, we live alone, we die alone,” he was mistaken. Even when we are alone, we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis—a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. Some animals are colonized by microbes while they are still unfertilized eggs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then proceed through our lives in their presence. When we eat, so do they. When we travel, they come along. When we die, they consume us. Every one of us is a zoo in our own right—a colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collection. An entire world. 
Trying to map what it is to be a physical human being, in something like the  Human Genome Project, is a daunting task. But our genes tell only part of our story, like a novel with a beginning and ending but no middle. That middle is taken up by the vast array of other life that exists within our bodies. While the guests we harbor may not necessarily be in league with Satan, they are a mixed lot. They mean us no harm, particularly, and we have evolved very workable symbiotic relationships with them, but they are not necessarily our friends either. They took up residence for their own benefit and will stick around and provide benefits to us only as long as we provide what they need, like that girl/boy friend you remember with gritted teeth.I won’t say this book will blow your mind, but this is your brainAnd it’s not even Mardi Gras – from the Brain Association of MississippiThis is your brain after reading this bookShame about that haircut[In the interest of full disclosure, it should be known that every day when my wife was reading this book, she would walk in the door and tell me of yet another thing she had read that had totally blown her mind. Not that my mind didn't go Ka-Boom when I read it. It certainly it. But hers was blown first. I only steal from the best. ]I Contain Multitudes will change how you understand not only the human body, but all the biota on the planet, hell, the universe. It will help you understand how it can happen that diseases like the flu can adapt so quickly to our latest attempts to stamp them out. It will help you understand why coral reefs are dying. It will give you some new words that help keep the new knowledge manageable. (My favorite is dysbiosis which is what it sounds like, a biological parallel to dystopia, with a hint of enforced disorganization.) It will expand your appreciation for how microbial biology works within people and in the world. It will offer you hope that there can be a future in which many of our maladies will not only be diagnosable, but will be treatable with the introduction of the right, specific probiotic. It will do your dishes and massage your feet. Well, ok, not the last two, but KABOOM, big new look-at-the-world stuff. Ok, you biologist types, pre-med, med, post med, anti-med, wearers of white lab coats, whatever the length, you know this stuff, at least I hope you do. But for most of the rest of us it is indeed a big change, a new layer of reality, well maybe not entirely new, but new enough to go KABOOM!Our intro to the world of which Yong writes, antibiotics, is probably akin to the one WW II bombadiers had through their bombsites. Amazing invention/discovery, antibiotics. They do a great job of wiping out pathogens, the nasties that make us ill, well, some of them anyway. Other harmful microbial types, the viral ones, roll their eyes at incoming antibiotics and keep on with what they are up to. However, as with items dropped from passing aircraft, the use of antibiotics entails considerable collateral damage, as the human body is a container for a vast array of microbial life. One might well envision millions of non-pathogenic residents shaking their fists as the incomings not only wipe out the harmful bugs, but vast numbers of the helpful ones as well. Ed Yong offers a more on-the-ground look, filling us in on what is actually going on inside, and how this part of what’s inside relates to that other part.If these folks can have an entire civilization inside a locker, just imagine what might develop in your liver or large intestine.If you don’t know who Ed Yong is, it’s a good bet that you will before too long. Yong is a popular science guy, a Neal DeGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Mary Roach, Jacques Cousteau, David Attenborough, Carl Sagan sort, a person who can take the wild, wonderful and fascinating things that are going on in the world of science and distill them all down for public consumption without making viewers’ or readers’ eyes glaze over, or listeners’ ears suddenly clog, without making you feel like an ill-educated dolt, and he accomplishes this with enough humor to produce a fair number of smiles and an occasional LOL. (Not in Mary Roach’s league for humor, but hey, who is?) He is an award-winning science writer at The Atlantic, whose work has appeared in a wide range of publications, from The New York Times to Nature, from The Guardian to Wired, from Slate to Scientific American, and on and on. He splits his time between London and DC, and I would not be at all surprised if he dashes back and forth in a TARDIS. I have provided links in EXTRA STUFF that will lead you down rabbit holes of fun material from Yong that may take you a while to leave.Ed Yong - From SpeakerpediaAmong the many surprises you will encounter here are a squid with its own high-beams, the microbial advantage of vaginal birth, the impact of gut microbes on mood, why a third of human milk is set aside for our guests (protection payments?), the relationship between the US Navy and mucus, why no man may be an island, but we may be archipelagos, and vats more. There is serious consideration given to how our relationships with this invisible world evolved:
…animals emerged in a world that had already been teeming with microbes for billions of years. They were the rulers of the planet long before we arrived. And when we did arrive, of course we evolved ways of interacting with the microbes around us. It would be absurd not to, like moving into a new city wearing a blindfold, earplugs, and a muzzle. Besides, microbes weren’t just unavoidable: they were useful. They fed the pioneering animals. Their presence also provided valuable cues to areas rich in nutrients, to temperatures conducive to life, or flat surfaces upon which to settle. By sensing these cues, pioneering animals gained valuable information about the world around them…hints of those ancient interactions still abound today.
 “It all depends.” As if life wasn’t complicated enough. Don’t you just love it when you are looking for help and the person you are asking responds with “It all depends.” And it really does, and it really will. What will be different, though, will be that your caregiver will have a much better idea than most caregivers can possibly have today. They will be able to look at a profile from a type of blood test and match potential solutions to the bacteria living in your gut, or wherever else in your two-legged bacteria condo might pertain. This knowledge is still in its infancy – at least a broad knowledge, but it is coming, and has the potential to make meaningful improvements in our health.
As microbiologist Patrice Cani told me, “The future will be a la carte.”And in this a la carte future, we won’t have to stop at picking the right bacteria for the job. Some scientists are picking the right genes for the job, and combining them into artisanal bacteria. Rather than just recruiting species with the right abilities, they are tinkering with the microbes themselves to endow them with new skills. 
Balance – from Explainxkcd.comThis raises some concerns, although they do not get a lot of attention here. If scientists can develop designer probiota to ameliorate suffering, there will always be evil-doers eager to use new technology to make designer biota intended to act as pathogens. In fact that is pretty much my sole gripe about this book. I wish more space had been devoted to the potential dangers of this advancing treatment modality. Just ask yourself, What would ISIS do?The title of Ed Yong’s book may not be up there with The Selfish Gene, Silent Spring, or Guns, Germs and Steel but what it lacks in snappy-ness it more than makes up for in content. This is a smart, readable explanation of one of the major ongoing scientific revolutions of our time. If you look deep inside yourself you will know that this is absolutely must-read material.

151,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"I feel like this book really exemplifies what I want from a science book written for a mass audience. It made everything really accessible and easy to understand without sacrificing on providing details or explanations. It provides a lot of citations so I can go look up the specific research papers and experiments mentioned that are of most interest to me, which I did. It also just connected research to larger ideas and theories for why things work the way they do. I think the whole point of science and the interest in it has to do with its ability to provide insight and answers into the why of things, at least for me. I also think Yong was really good about explaining the limitations of the research while also making the reader excited about where things could potentially go. Like I think it can be quite hard to straddle that line between talking about the exciting potential of something while also being clear that it might not go anywhere and that there's a lot of complexity and limitation in science. Also he mentioned one of my favorite books of all time, The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life, at the beginning so that automatically made me like the author a lot more. Anyways I really enjoyed this, I know I've been reading a lot of non-fiction so far this year, and this has definitely been one of the best ones so fat this year."
152,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,5,"For my entire hospital career I have worked in oncology, where I have been part of teams taking care of people with cancer. Frequently patients have “neutropenic fevers,” a condition considered to be potentially harmful and almost always requiring admission to the hospital. Neutrophils are those brave little white blood cells that go out into our bodies and do battle with all the nasty things our bodies are exposed to every day. Neutropenia means the patient has none of those cells to speak of (and this is why herd immunity and vaccines are important). We culture blood and urine, scan lungs, treat with antibiotics, and monitor for a few days to see if any microbes grow out in cultures. We teach people to fastidiously handwash, and avoid people who are sick. We make them wear masks in the hallways, in order to filter out airborne viruses. Their rooms have special filtration systems. We encourage them to make safe food choices, avoiding foods that can’t be washed or scrubbed clean, or might be undercooked. And you want to know the kicker? If these patients are infected, it’s usually because of microbes in their own body have run amok and caused infection.You know what else is in the hospital? Microbes. Tons of antibiotic-resistant microbes, hanging out in patient bodies and everywhere else. Once someone is cultured positive for these microbes, they stay on “isolation” for the duration of the visit--and sometimes for life in the case of microbes resistant to all antibiotics--in the (vain) hopes that staff, visitors and patients won’t go moving those resistant microbes around the hospital. A shift where I don’t where a yellow isolation gown to go into these rooms is pretty unusual.Yong made my little grey cells stretch and reach, and now I have yet more ways to think about microbes, and I dearly wish he would re-write this book–maybe in magazine form–every couple years so I can keep up with all the interesting research. Like David Quammen, Yong doesn’t just stick to one branch of research science; he wanders around many fields as he explores the impact microbes have made on us. He’ll first have you thinking about their sheer evolutionary weight (literally and figuratively), reminding us that we evolved in context of a microbe landscape, not the other way round (and some thought apes were a stretch). Like living on a planet where most of the water is saltwater, it makes sense that microbes would impact the evolution of life.Yong walks the reader through some of the science that show how animals evolved to use microbes (and perhaps vice versa?). Some are evolutionary, some genetic, some macro. There’s a lovely experiment where a glowing squid developed a sequestered area for those microbes–can’t set them free in the body, of course, so you have to create a special compartment.In other words, I highly recommend this book. It’s quite well researched and documented, with extensive citations. There’s a bibliography and index, for those that want to delve further or pick and choose. As a further note, I’ll say that I always appreciate researchers/writers who express appreciation for those they interview and follow, without being fawning, and Yong does a nice job with that as well. There are parts I really liked, parts I liked less, parts where someone should have trimmed his descriptive writing just a tad, but any book that keeps me thinking about it months later is a five star read.I’m going to put my detailed book report below page break at my wordpress site ( https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2019/...) with notes heavily on the medical and the ocean science. There’s also some interesting stuff about insects, for those who might lean that way, and trees."
153,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"Inner values get, in this context, wholly new, trillion of dimensions.Like so many prejudices, those against microorganisms are stupid and shortsighted. The first associations are not symbiosis and better health but infection and disease because the negative image is over-represented. Hygiene and health are essential, but the benefits of invisible companions are far too rarely highlighted and the beneficial minis outweigh the pests by far. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms is necessary for good health, built on a microorganism friendly diet.Without a symbiosis with a few pounds of microorganisms that are spread over and through the whole body, human life would not be possible, metabolic processes would stop death would be inevitable. A co-evolution has made all higher living beings dependent on the colonizers because they defend humans against enemy invaders which could harm their host. Of course, they also assist with bodily functions because they bring benefits to them so that the motivation for the defense help is not purely altruistic. They form a second front against attackers and it are often the human eaters themselves who are to blame when they wreck their microflora and lose the second shield because of permanently unhealthy nom nom.The coevolution of higher life with invisible helpers is long and has usually developed into a symbiosis. Much has happened since the first bacterium settled in a higher being while it was itself being altered by a virus etc.The ever more severe human intervention in this cycle has led to problems within less than 75 years. Since the advent of antibiotics and serial mass production of drugs, allergies, food sensitivities, autoimmune diseases, multidrug-resistant germs, lifestyle diseases, etc. are on the rise. How much of this is related to the destruction of the natural balance in the body, can be difficult to estimate due to a lack of studies. A one-sided diet with an excessive intake of antibiotics in addition to various other drugs is an essential factor that turns the symbiosis into a dysbiosis.Many drugs include, as a side effect, a mass extinction combined with a collapse of the miniaturized social order, civil wars and a lengthy reconstruction of it. With medicine and hygiene, much money can be made and as a result, super-pathogens grow in hospitals, while chemical gangs in the body of the patients decimate the defense forces of the body.Therapies with alternative and gentler drugs would be a new competitive and biological disinfectant and more expensive than artificial chemicals in the short term without including long-time costs. The patients pay for this with their health and sometimes life.The potential market with tailor-made probiotics and the manipulation and improvement of microfauna with genetically modified organisms is a future-oriented industry. As soon as enough bucks are made with conventional medicine, the Big Players will enter it. Until then it will be vilified and kept down.Actually the effort, according to the standards of medical economics, would not be responsible. Individualized medicine would have to first check the patients for potential vulnerabilities in their microbiome and then create a tailored therapy for them. A great alternative for rich people, but all others continue to receive the standard procedure of conventional treatment that kills friend and foe alike.If one eats microbe-hostile, one gets problems because a healthy, natural and balanced diet ensures a stable and robust micro-environment. Industrially highly processed and unhealthy food kills many of the little helpers and in their places settle less species-rich constellations, sometimes almost monocultures of dodgy creaturs. These not only damage health in addition to the unhealthy diet but also ensure that the desire for excessive and destructive gluttony with junk food never breaks off in the brain. Their interest in a steady supply is justified. A dietary change to fresh, low-fat, salt-reduced and sugar-free diets could significantly reduce their intake. Everyone has to make a choice themselves. Fit and peaceful armies that have lived and protected us for eons or, alternatively, mercenary junkie armies with dubious loyalty, prone to excesses and arson. One willingly lets them move around in the heartland until one loses control over them or they desert and begin dismantling oneself from within. Many times, a supposed protective power has in retrospect proved to be the worst enemy.The brain partakes at every meal and accordingly, the performance can be expanded or reduced. Not only the body feels sluggish after too much food, but the gray cells are overwhelmed too. It is not so much the energy used in digestion or the inertia that sets in with permanent overeating. Much more the fuel of the brain is of poor quality. In the car or an expensive machine, one would not pour substandard gasoline or cheap oil. This mentality does not apply to one's own body. From one-sided nutrition with inferior food of low quality less valuable substances can be extracted, which would be necessary for optimal brain function. One eats oneself dumb.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiota"
154,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten,5,"”The latest estimates suggest that we have around 30 trillion human cells and 39 trillion microbial ones – a roughly even split. Even these numbers are inexact, but that does not really matter: by any reckoning, we contain multitudes.”“Perhaps it is less that I contain multitudes and more that I am multitudes.”I realized, as I was reading this book, that I have not had antibiotics in over twenty-five years. When I shared that information with my friends, the reactions were anywhere from “Wow” to “that is impossible.” Those reactions indicated to me how overly reliant we have become on antibiotics to fight what we perceive to be bad microbes. Of course, antibiotics are indiscriminate in what they kill. They are definitely a kill-them-all-and-let-Odin-sort-them-out kind of killer. ”But antibiotics are shock-and-awe weapons. They kill the bacteria we want as well as those we don’t – an approach that’s like nuking a city to deal with a rat. We don’t even need to see the rat to begin the massacre: many antibiotics are prescribed needlessly to treat viral infections they have no hope of countering.”I don’t get sick very often, and when I do, I seem to get sick to a lesser extent than do other people who are suffering from the same malady. Lucky genetics or maybe I’ve got a well balanced microbiome. I grew up on a farm and was exposed to a lot of microbes, more than the average person. In fact, one of the problems that is plaguing the first world is the fact that a greater percentage of people are not exposed to animals, a great source of useful microbes, or even just the outdoors, where we encounter microbes, bad and good, that help us format a diverse microbiome. They live in concrete worlds that are beneficial to health in the short term, but bad for health in the long term. They don’t run a gauntlet of infectious diseases that actually make them more resilient to illnesses. Their immune systems lack experience and become jumpy, overreacting to allergies and other minor threats. I think we may discover that microbes hold the key to all of our health issues. Big Brother might be watching us go about our daily lives, but what about the control imposed by the Orwellian, brainless, single-cell organisms inside of us? What we eat may not always be our idea. I’ve always been a bit wary of being manipulated by my own hormones, but what if I’m being manipulated by the microbes in my digestive tract as to what foods I like? ”Different microbes fare better on certain diets. Some are peerless at digesting plant fibres. Others thrive on fats. When you choose your meals, you are also choosing which bacteria get fed, and which get an advantage over their peers. But they don’t have to sit there and graciously await your decision. As we have seen, bacteria have ways of hacking into the nervous system. If they released dopamine, a chemical involved in feelings of pleasure and reward, when you ate the ‘right’ things, could they potentially train you to choose certain foods over others? Do they get a say in your menu picks?”So lean people have different levels of certain microbes in their digestive tract than overweight people. They tend to have a more balanced diet, heavy in veggies and fruits. Wonderful news, right? So to lose weight, all we have to do is take microbes from lean people and put them in overweight people. If only it were that easy. The problem is, those lean, mean producing microbes need to eat, so if the overweight person doesn’t change his diet and feed those microbes what they want to eat, they starve. This is, of course, an oversimplification of all the issues that go into trying to improve or change a microbiome, but the possibilities, with further research, are encouraging. I know we all want the magic pill that doesn’t require us to change our lifestyle or food choices, but what if your food preferences are being dictated by a microbe that has hijacked your nervous system to manipulate you into feeding it what it wants? That to me is sort of like being possessed by a demon. “‘America is a constipated nation,’ he said, indelicately. ‘If you pass small stools, you have big hospitals.’” If I miss a day not passing a bowel movement, I get annoyed. I like it when my intestinal tract is working like a well-oiled machine. I want the outgoing to keep up with the incoming. Nothing makes me feel less healthy than to think of BM hanging out in my intestinal tract any longer than it has to. When my digestive tract is working the way I want it to, it is operating to the theme song of Rawhide.
”Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'RawhideShe rollin', rollin', rollin'Though the streams are swollenKeep them doggies rollin', rawhideThrough rain an' wind an' weatherHellbent for leatherMove 'em on, head 'em upHead 'em up, move 'em onMove 'em on, head 'em upRawhide.”
 We are coming out of an era where we were convinced that any microbe was a bad microbe and finally are starting to embrace the idea that some microbes are not only good for us but essential. We pick up microbes from the people around us, and some of those microbes get added to our microbiome. I was reading this article, titled Your Partner could affect Your Microbiome, about a study conducted on heterosexual couples to see how much influence each had on the other’s microbiome. ”After testing the samples, the researchers noted that microbes had been swapped between couples to a significant enough extent that computer algorithms were able to link a person to their partner with an accuracy of 86 percent.” Makes me wonder about the 14%: so how much interaction do you have with your partner? The next thought, of course, is to think about the fact that your partner also brings with her the microbes received from past partners, and now those microbes have been shared with you. *Shudder* It is probably best not to think about it. I came away from reading this book thinking that microbes might provide solutions to many health issues that have plagued us for generations, such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and autoimmune disorders. Microbes have the ability to adapt and borrow from other microbes and change their makeup and purpose. The possibilities are, therefore, endless for us to find elusive cures hidden right in the microscopic multitudes within us. We have used microbes to dengue-fever proof mosquitoes and to save skin infected frogs from Amphibiageddon. My question is, can we use some of those breakthroughs to save the bees and potentially even the human race? The sky's the limit, and only with the very recent change in mindset about microbes have we begun to explore the potential. We have one great advantage…we know microbes exist! So take care of your microbiome, and start by reading this fascinating book. You will look at the world you can’t see with microscopic eyes.

155,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,0,"Update: Antibiotics and obesity. It is routine in the US (although banned in the UK and Canada) to give cows, pigs, chickens etc low doses of antibiotics in order to fatten them up. No one knows why the antibiotics make them gain weight on the same amount of food, but they do. There is no reason to suppose that we are any different. The mechanism has to do with altering the biome, the microbes in the body, but how long the effect lasts isn't known, it might be a lifetime thing.Antibiotics and resistance. We are told that we are overprescribed antibiotics and that is causing resistance, but the amount of antibiotics any individual gets is absolutely minor compared to the amount that we consume. Not only consume from meat, but since animal droppings are used for fertilizer, perhaps from our bread and vegetables and water too. It reminds me of recycling and the emphasis on all of us individuals doing it. However, 98% of all waste is industrial, retail and from restaurants. Go to many supermarkets and they charge you for a plastic bag (if they even have them), go to a 'green' supermarket like Whole Foods and they give a paper one. Then look at the produce, it's packed in plastic, the meat is in styrofoam, the deli salads in plastic, the knife and fork you got to eat them with are plastic, the coffe cup (recyclable!) has a plastic lid, the bottle of juice is probably plastic but the straw is paper. Plastic is cheap and convenient, clean, easy to store and keeps things fresh. Why change if you can make people feel they are the problem and that you are helping them to do the right thing? It's just clever marketing. They are the 98% of the problem and until they address the issues of pollution and climate change in their own industries and stores, no matter how hard we try, we will only make ... 2% of a difference.____________________Schizophrenia used to be blamed on cold mothers, autism likewise, it was the mother's fault. We've moved on now to proving it is the mother getting flu or measles (why didn't she get vaccinated, oh how could she do this and risk inflicting her child.... dadadada. Oh no she couldnt' get vaccinated because that causes.... dadadada).   ""Patterson had read that pregnant women who incur serious infections, like flu or measles, are more likely to have kids with autism and schizophrenia. He thought that a mother's immune responses might somehow affect the development of her baby's brain. He just didn't know how."".......... ""And they realised that Patterson's mice had gut problems in common with actual autistic children: both were likely to have diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal disorders, and both harboured unusual comunities of gut bicrobes. Perhaps, the duo reasoned, fixing those gut problems might also lead to changes in behaviour."" And so it goes on, these male scientists keen to prove that these links to lab mice proved the mother caused autism in her babies. Until, science writer, a woman, Emily Willingham points out that, 
""Mice don't have autism, which is a human neurobiological construct shaped in part by social and cultural perceptions of what is considered normal. Is a mouse repeatedly burying a marble really like a child rocking back and forth? Is a lower frequency of squeaks the same as being unable to talk to other people? If you squint just so, the similarities jump out . Look again and and you might see parallels with other conditions. 
Then the killer - the lab mice used were originally bred to model schizophrenia. So you have scientists saying that the bacteria in the guts of autistic babies and schizophrenic mice who cannot possibly be bred in any way to be autistic proves that it is the mother is responsible, it's just more time is needed to find the proof, the microbes responsible.It's scientific confirmation bias. It's akin to a scientific conspiracy theory. One way or another the mother must be blamed. And say, as the woman science writer says, that all these gut problems can be seen as not just similarities but absolute parallels to other conditions, not autism ."
156,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40898015-jamie,5,"Well, I will never think of bacteria and archaea the same. I certainly have a newfound understanding of just how vital it is to every part of life. That microbes and bacteria have helped shape our planet for billions of years, down to every single flora and fauna; even all the oxygen we breath has come from bacteria. I also never really thought about the microbes that are constantly around us and even on me, or how many you are ""seeding"" to the world. That""every person aerosolises 37 million bacteria per hour"". And, if that isn't crazy enough, how about ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars"". To me, learning all of this was just simply incredible-the effortless symbiosis of microbes with the environment and with ourselves. I could go on and on about this book-so I will end with is, this is hands down one of my favorite science books. The ""science"" wasn't intimidating to read, as the author didn't assume you were already an expert on the subject. It wasn't dry either, and a few parts made me laugh. This book would be great for anyone who is interested in learning about the unseen world going on all around them. "
157,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a fascinating book about the microbes inside all of us, and inside other animals as well. Now, it is often said that there are ten times as many bacteria in our bodies as there are cells. This, it turns out, is probably an over-estimate; the number of bacteria is probably in the same ballpark as the number of cells. But still, that is a lot!This book goes into detail about the amazing partnerships--the symbioses--between microbes and large organisms, mostly animals and humans. Microbes are essential to digestion, to our immune systems, and many other functions.Every person has his own population of microbes, which can be different between individuals. And we spread our microbes around; every day we deposit 30 million of them by breathing, touching things, and by excretions.Most microbes are not harmful to humans. But the distinction between harmful and not harmful and helpful is not always crystal clear. Microbes in our guts help digestion, but if they escape into the blood stream they can be deadly. I really enjoyed learning how dengue can be prevented by infecting mosquitos with a common bacterium called Wolbachia.I learned all sorts of great things. For example, probiotic foods and supplements have not been proven to be effective. Also, toilets that are cleaned too often are more likely to be covered in bacteria. And, hospital rooms with closed windows contain more deadly microbes than the fresh air outside. Some scientists believe that microbes are responsible for obesity, and even for high blood pressure.This book is actually fun to read, filled with subtle humor, and extremely informative. This book is so well written, I must recommend it to everyone."
158,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84916113-somebunny-reads-phoenix,5,"I am Legion.  So, apparently human beings (and all beings in general) are just bags of bacteria and other microorganisms, and these fascinating fellas have always dominated the Earth, from the birth of life to present days: there are more bacteria in our guts than starts in our galaxy. Interesting, uh? I would say a wonderful topic for a wonderful book! I loved this book and found it extremely interesting for many reasons. First, because it was very well-written, and second because it opened my mind to the fascinating field of microbiology, which I'd never think it would be for interest for me (a linguist). This book literally opened a new door for me, and since starting this read I watched documentaries and collected all kinds of information on bacteria, virus, and microorganisms in general. For example, did you know that our body contains so many bacteria that there are roughly the same amount of human cells and bacteria cells inside it? Or that sponges are such simple animals and yet full of microbes that sometimes, if you look at a sponge under a microscope, you will barely be able to see the animal for the microbes that cover it? Or that there is such a thing as a poop transplant (Faecal Microbiota Transplant, or FMT), in which stool samples from one healthy individual are inserted into someone else's intestines to re-create a healthy microbe environment and thus fighting many digestion-related illnesses? This book was all extremely interesting, and I think it also contains two very important messages to always keep in mind: first (something that many people, but not all people, know), that not all microorganisms are bad, and some of them are not only fundamental to sustain life and normal functions of animals and plants, but can also be used to cure health conditions and preserve the environment. Our indiscriminate war against germs, overdoing with disinfectant and antibiotics, is both straightening bad bacteria and endangering good ones, with repercussions on our and our Planets's health. Second, that this field is one of the most futurist fields of science, and we'll probably see incredible developments in the future: the creation of medicines based on probiotics, bacteria artificially engineered to fight diseases; and, incidentally, we'll probably see a lot of this stuff in sci-fi. Of course, as the author himself points out, scientists always have the ambition to find a grand unified theory, a master equation which can elegantly explain our universe, and microbiology, with its recent discoveries on how our life on the Planet started (seriously, look it up or read about it in this book, it's fascinating), how microorganisms are intertwined with hosts in complex symbiotic relationships which can even affect genome, and how much we could potentially do/cure just using bacteria, is currently one of the most fashionable candidates. Without having to believe that bacteria is the solution to all our problems, from dying crops to saving the coral reef and solve both malnutrition and obesity, let alone eradicating lymphatic filariasis and dengue fever; we instead can and should try to educate ourselves more about the microcosm which thrives inside of us and inside the smallest of bugs, so that we can learn how to respect it and be aware of the danger those small little things can pose to us, but also us to them. Bacteria can get extinct too, and who knows how many good friends we used to have in our guts before we killed them and started getting irritable bowls! Save your friendly neighbour bacterium!!! "
159,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,5,"Though we might lather our skin with antibacterial soap, clean our hands with alcohol sanitizers, gargle with mouthwash, scrub our kitchen surfaces, disinfect our bathrooms, spray Lysol all over the house, take antibiotics, etc., there are - and always will be - microbes everywhere. This is especially true of our warm moist bodies - which are covered inside and out with microorganisms....and this is a good thing.Bacteria are on and in our bodiesIn fact our bodies are really an indivisible aggregate of 'our' tissues and organs....and the microbial world that makes its home there. Moreover this is true for every multicellular organism on Earth. The totality of microorganisms (and their parts) in/on our bodies is called our 'microbiome', and it's composed of myriad kinds of bacteria, viruses, archaea, snippets of microbial DNA, and other miniscule microbial fragments. This microbiome helps digest our food, produces vitamins and minerals, breaks down toxins and dangerous chemicals, guides our embryonic development, assists our immune system, probably influences our behavior, and so on. There are many kinds of microbes in the worldIn this entertaining and illuminating book, Yong touches on the evolution of microbes; the history of microbiology; symbiotic relationships among microbes; symbiosis between microbes and higher organisms; dysbiosis (unbalanced microbiomes that harm their hosts); how scientists study and identify microbiomes; research studies aimed at seeding hospitals and buildings with 'good microbes'; and much more.Symbiotic microbes provide nutrients for plantsHospitals are covered with microorganisms. Seeding hospitals with 'good microbes' might prevent 'bad microbes' from growing.Most people probably associate microbes with disease, and Yong provides some examples of pathogenic organisms. The vast majority of microbes are beneficial though, and I was fascinated to read about their varied roles in the world of living things. I've had a rather varied career and in a galaxy far away and long ago I got a degree in microbiology.....but this book has a lot of new and exciting information. I'll give examples of a few intriguing factoids gleaned from the book:1. We can improve our health by nurturing 'helpful' bacteria in our digestive system. Since fiber-loving bacteria are supposed to boost the immune system I added a LOT of fiber to my diet.....and I think I feel healthier already!! We need 'good microbes' in our stomach 2. Newborns are bathed in good microbes during vaginal delivery. Thus, infants born by caesarean section - lacking this initial 'seeding' - develop different microbiomes than vaginal babies. Breast-feeding also provides babies with an initial dose of beneficial microbes. 3. It's good for kids to have a dog because the pooch brings outdoor microbes into the home. Being exposed to a larger variety of microorganisms reduces the likelihood of getting allergies. 4. The author, Ed Yong, really likes the Hawaiian bobtail squid, which contains large colonies of luminous bacteria. Whenever Yong mentions this critter he calls it 'adorable.' (ha ha ha)Bacteria make squids luminous This tome covers a fascinating array of topics in an understandable - and sometimes humorous - fashion. I love this book and would recommend it to everyone.

160,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"Recently I've been hearing reports of miracle cures of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by use of fecal matter transplants. Also I've heard that some autoimmune diseases may be caused by environments that are too clean. Upon hearing these things the question that comes to my mind is, why this new found enthusiasm for microorganisms? We've known about bacteria since Louis Pasteur. So why all this new information about microbes as if it was something new? (Actually we learn in this book that Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered the prevalence of bacteria on all sorts of surfaces in the 1680s, but for unexplained reasons his findings were pretty much ignored for 200 years.) What I learned from this book is that the new technologies of gene sequencing and genomics has changed everything. Before gene sequencing careful study of microbes was limited to those that could be grown on a culture medium. With current tools it is possible to sequence every single gene in a sample from a skin flake, stream bed, or any environmental or body surface. Suddenly researchers were able to provide detailed descriptions of myriad microbiota (This book uses the term microbiome.)What scientists are learning is that the number, variety and prevalence of microorganisms exceeded all expectations. Combined with our understanding of evolution we now know that all of life has co-evolved within close contact with microbes. Consequently many functions of animal life are either dependent on, or aided and regulated by, microorganisms. Food digestion is a leading example of this. This book warns that current science is in the early phases of understanding microbiomes and that we shouldn't become too excited about spectacular claims made by probiotic manufacturers. However, I believe that the wording used by this book in some cases hypes things a bit too much. In particular I'm don't like the way this book makes the statement that, ""The majority of cells in our body are not human, they're microbes."" Technically that statement is true, but it is misleading. The statement is true regarding the number of cells, but not mass (i.e. weight). Only about 1 to 3 percent of the human body weight is from microbes located mostly in the gut. The reason for this disparity between mass and numbers of cells is that most human cells (e.g. muscle, fat, & blood cells) are larger and more massive than bacterial cells. The information I've explained above about the mass of human cells and bacterial cells is not explained in this book. The book simply makes the statement regarding the number of cells which I'm sure will lead some people to make the declarative statement, ""Did you know that most of the human body is made of bugs?""The book explains why we should think of bacteria and viruses as companions, not enemies. Our efforts at being antibacterial—killing all microbial growth—can sometimes provide an environment in which pathogens can proliferate. But there is one quotation in the book by a doctor that provided another perspective to consider. ""I've never seen anybody die from getting antibiotics, but I've seen some die from the lack of them.""Also, our immune system evolved in an environment of mild background contamination. Thus, our modern clean living environments may be a contributor to increased occurrences of some autoimmune ailments. But of course we all know that contaminated environments can cause disease. Perhaps, as we learn more about microbiomes we'll learn to get the level of contamination just right. This book provides a good overall discussion of the expanding knowledge and understanding of microbes.The following is a link to an excerpt from the book about ""when Leeuwenhoek discovered Microorganisms:http://www.delanceyplace.com/view-arc..."
161,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"I liked this book so I am giving it three stars. It is common knowledge today that everything and all of us are covered with microbes - that some are good and some are bad. Their number can be debated. We have in the past been fixated on getting rid of them. This has been to our detriment. It is clear we have gone too far. Antibiotics are good and necessary, but at the same time they must be used with care. In heedlessly wiping out microbes, we have created an environment where pathogens proliferate. This book is about the symbiosis we have with the microbes living on and in our bodies and in our environment. It is about our need to develop a harmonious relationship between us and them. The book begins with a rather long introduction. I wanted the book to get going; what we were being told was all too general. The introduction is followed by a chapter which focuses on the history of bacteriology, beginning with the Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's (1632 - 1723) development of the microscope. He was the first to observe and describe single celled organisms. The growth of microbiology is reviewed through a discussion of the discoveries of scientists such as Louis Pasteur, Élie Metchnikoff, Theodor Rosebury, René Dubos and others. Microbiologists one has heard of and others less well-known. After the historical review, the remainder of the book contains fascinating information on more contemporary studies, but there is no real structure to the presentation. First of all, the titles of the chapters do not clearly indicate what the chapter will be about. Here are four titles so you can see what I mean:-The Long Waltz-Mutually Assured Success-Allegro in E Major -Microbes à la CarteOn completion of a chapter I had learned a smattering of information, all of which I had found interesting, but what exactly that particular chapter was focused upon most often eluded me. Topics brought up in one chapter come up again in another. For me, when reading a non-fiction book on a topic where my own knowledge is weak, I need structure. There is a heavy use of acronyms and scientific abbreviations, which are explained once, but most often just once. The same is true of the scientific terms used for particular experimental procedures, chemical compounds and pathogens. You can read this book without in-depth previous knowledge, but the more you know before you pick it up the easier it will be to understand. It definitely helped me to have recently read The Gene: An Intimate History. Today scientists are sequencing the genes of the microbes around us. Bacteria readily swap genes, something which humans do not do, but our cells can integrate foreign genetic material from bacteria. It is important to stress that we are today only beginning to understand the symbiotic relationship between our cells and the microbes living in, on and around us. This book does not give definitive answers but indicates where the future may take us. Numerous studies are cited. Here follow examples of topics discussed - fecal transplants, probiotics, studies on the bacteria feeding sugars in breast milk, the beneficial qualities of vaginal microbes for babies’ health and gut microbes in preventing obesity and autoimmune diseases, the value of dogs in increasing the microbe diversity in our homes, the decimation of coral reefs, squid with luminous bacteria. The topics are many and not only about humans, but other flora and fauna too. The book provides a lot of really interesting information, but I wanted a better structure to it all.The audiobook is very well narrated by Charlie Anson. Clear and easy to follow. The narration I have given four stars."

166,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Yong explores the microbiome, not just in humans but in many creatures. He reveals the amazing variety of ways that microorganisms influence their multicellular counterparts. A properly balanced microbiome is not only critical to health, but can be essential to proper development, reproduction and survival. In essence we are one system with the many trillions of foreign organisms in our bodies. We rely on each other. Not that there is a clear cut line between beneficial and pathogenic, a single organism can be both depending on the circumstances. As Yong notes, the immune system is not just a defense against disease causing organisms, it is a manager of our microbiome, ideally operating to maximize its benefits and minimize its dangers.Yong offers numerous examples of the codependence of microbes and animals including humans. One example we can easily relate to concerns a mother’s milk. In human milk there are sugars called human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), over 200 different ones, yet infants are not able to digest them. However, there is a bacteria that eats it all up, Bifidobacterium longum infantis. In return it feeds short-chain fatty acids to the gut cells. B. infantis also helps these cells generate an adhesive to fill gaps between them and it promotes the cells’ manufacture of anti-inflammatory compounds. Not only that, B. infantis helps infant brains grow by producing the sialic acid they need. And there is more. B. infantis attracts some pathogens acting as a decoy preventing them from invading gut cells. This microbe earns its keep.We are familiar with the term symbiosis which applies to the relationship between the microbiome and humans. Endosymbiosis is a more exact description of that relationship since the microbes live in and on us. Yong uses the term dysbiosis to describe when that relationship goes awry, when there is a loss of balance between the microbiome and the immune system. Such an imbalance can contribute to illness and conditions such as nutritional deficiency, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, and many, many more. Unfortunately pinning down the exact constituents of the microbiome responsible is very difficult. Typically there is not one bad actor, but varying mixes of microbes that cause trouble and then only in people with particular genetics or circumstances. Think of your body as an ecosystem. One piece may go astray, but real trouble doesn’t show up until many pieces have been affected, making it exceedingly problematic to understand how the imbalance begins.Biologist Lynn Margulis, persevering in the face of intense criticism, became famous for making the evolutionary role of endosymbiosis credible. Today it is a widely accepted explanation for the mitochondria in our cells which came from a captured bacterium. She also came up with the word holobiant to describe a community of species that stay together throughout their lives including us and our microbiome. This concept can also be applied to genes. Biologists such as Richard Dawkins consider animals and other life forms to be vehicles for genes. Evolution operates to select genes. Their vehicles can change as needed. The genes in our microbiome directly influence our well-being and behavior. Shouldn’t they be considered a part of the set of genes being selected for in our evolution? In other words, the genes of the holobiant together determine the evolutionary vehicle. Consider the example Yong offers of two “species” of closely related flies. They were thought to be separate species. They never mated and they contained different microbiomes. But give them antibiotics and they will successfully mate. Microbes can change an animal’s smell and other factors that can determine mating preference. Eventually these two fly communities with different microbiomes will become distinct species if they never mate. Just as with these flies, it is our hologenome that may be deciding our future.Yong explores the therapeutic potential of changing our microbiome. We make a stab at this today with prebiotics, probiotics and fecal transplants. But to reliably tackle most conditions will require cocktails of bacteria properly proportioned to individual needs. These would require testing for efficacy and safety as would any medicine. We also need to think carefully about how antibiotics and antimicrobials affect the microbiome and the bacteria we encounter. As we begin the age of gene therapy, we can consider not only manipulating the bacteria in our microbiomes but their genes as well. Microbes can be much more easily engineered with genes than can animal cells. Bacteria exchange genes through horizontal transfer. They don’t have to inherit them but can readily pick them up from their neighbors. Thus genes from transient bacteria can get into your microbiome. Astounding, however, is the increasing evidence of bacterial gene horizontal transfer into animal cells. This is particularly true of insects which often have very intimate relationships with bacteria. How this happens needs to be explored. Throughout the book Yong relates example after example of the codependence of animals and bacteria. Bacteria can shape organ development, not only determine sex but change sex after it is established, stop or enable reproduction, stop or enable parasites, provide or block essential nutrients, eradicate or promote a species, decimate or protect a crop, alter the environment and much, much more. Yong makes the case that we need to consider our relationship with bacteria particularly our hologenome if we are to understand our health, our behavior and our future. We are at the beginning of a new appreciation of the role bacteria play in the world, what it means to be human, and new approaches to tackle disease as well as shape our minds and bodies."

I think at times, scienctific nonfiction swings one of two ways--over simplified, or overly pendantic. This book truly hit the sweet spot. It's accessible, gorgeously written, and incredibly informative and well-researched.In particular, I liked that Yong doesn't shy away from differing schools of thought. Microbiology as we know it today is still a relatively new science, and as such there are a LOT of different opinions. Yong engages with all of the these. The level of nuance within this book is astounding, and truly elevates it.I also REALLY appreciated that Yong doesn't assume you miraculously remembered every detail from earlier chapters. He would repeat meanings behind acronyms, descriptions of bacteria and cell functions, and a whole lot of other things. However, this never feels repetitive. He's succinct, but also recognizes that his readers might, by chapter 8, forget a line or two from chapter 1. I definitely recommend this!"

In fact, I started it awhile ago, and just got distracted by other books, and put it down ... which never happens, if I'm enthralled by a book. When I finally came back to it, I did learn a few things, and read a few things aloud to hubby, so, all-in-all I suppose it was a 'good read'.4 Stars = Outstanding. It definitely held my interest."
169,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17746077-joshua-buhs,4,"A fascinating topic poorly served by the conventions of popular science writing.Ed Yong's book is about microbes--bacteria, mostly, but also viruses and few other extremely small creatures--and how they live with other organisms--humans for the most part, with plenty of other animals, too, though no plants.It has Darwinian ambitions, announced in its subtitle: ""A Grander View of Life"" evokes Darwin's famous phrase closing the first edition of ""On the Origin of Species"": ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.""And it is there in the basic organizing principle of the book. Darwin followed the recommendation of the philosopher of science William Whewell that a good scientific theory account for a range of facts--he called this the ""consilience of induction."" Yong is out to conciliate some inducting, too--so to speak--setting out a view of the interactions between animals and microbes that is extensive.For the past one hundred and fifty or so years, microbes have been mostly seen in the light of germ theory: that is, they have been either classed ad pathological or of little interest. In the last four decades (or so), a new view has taken shape: that microbes are neither good nor bad. But they are ubiquitous. And they are *integral* to multicellular life. Some are pathological. Some perform vital functions. They form an entire ecosystem, one upon which life depends, but one that has been mostly ignored, mostly invisible.As I say, this is a great story, with very important repercussions. The details are fascinating, and Yong is great at explaining the complex interplay between microbes and multicellular organisms in easy to understand ways--that usually do not feel condescending. (I could've used a little less forced humor: de gustibus and all that, though.) Just dipping into the various chapters and reading the sections involves one in some remarkable bits of biology. The book, on the level of the sections, is genuinely fun.There are, of course, important sequelae to this line of thought. One set concerns how we are to live in the world when we know its expanded dimension. Food choices, medicine choices, standard questions about environmental protection--all become more complicated when we have to take microbiology into account. This ""grander view"" of life also calls into question traditional boundaries--between the self and the environment, between humans and other organisms. If bacteria help to build your immune system, what does that mean for ideas about the integrity of the body? If moods and behaviors are effected by gut flora, what does that mean about human will and determinism?Darwin's book was arranged unusually--though brilliantly, in its way. (Waiting twenty years to publish gives certain advantages!) He started with artificial selection, as something most people would understand. Then, in the next two chapters, showed how the elements of artificial selection were inherent in nature, too: one chapter explored natural variety, the other natural competition. Chapter four then tied these various strands together, showing how natural selection worked in nature as an analogue of artificial selection. The remainder of the book--to simplify matters--gathers together a host of facts that can all be explained by natural selection, from the geological record to what we would now call genetics.Yong's book does not work quite so well on the level of chapters. It's fine, but not quite as elegant. There are basically three introductory chapters: one is a prologue, which situates Yong at a zoo watching a scientist investigate the microbial flora on the body of a pangolin. He then moves to another introductory chapter which sets out some guidelines, though these are not consistently used through the book to justify their presence here. He notes that humans are, in effect, islands, homes to vast swarms of bacteria, which can be characterized as neither good nor bad, but as essential to life as we know it. He also introduces the idea that geological time is very long--he's definitely influenced by Darwin and evolutionary biologists, and wants to root the book in its tropes, though they are not really necessary.The second body chapter then introduces us to the idea that various people have looked at microbes over the centuries, to differing ends. He starts with Leeuwenhoek, who was probably the first human to see microbes. But his research into bacteria and similar creatures was never really transformative. He then jumps to the nineteenth century when Pasteur and Koch and the rest put germ theory in place. This was the beginning of what remains the dominant way of looking at microbes.The rest of the chapter then introduces us to the more recent view, which he dates back to the late 1960s with the discovery of a whole new branch of life, the archaebacteria, and then expands to the surveys of microbial life that took off after that. There's a sense that microbiology of the 197os was a lot like American vertebrate biology of the 1900s-1920s, with intensive surveys to characterize most of the major groups and define their geological distribution.This is also the section when Yong could have made a stake for a particular kind of order to the rest of the book, but opted against it. Given that there is a generational element to the story, Yong could have characterized the various schools of microbiology that took shape during this time and given an overview of the people who were involved. Something like what William Leach did with ""The Butterfly People."" If nothing else, it would have helped to make sense of the on-coming chapters, with its huge cast of characters, some recurring, some connected, but the network never quite clear.Instead, what he wants to do is offer a history of ideas--which could work. That's what Darwin did, after all, showing the various ideas that fall under the overarching umbrella, and how they connect. And it is possible to see this, though it is never quite laid out clearly. Part of that is because, for all the introductory matter, the book is never introduced in any but the most general terms. Part of the reason is because the chapter titles are jokey, and so not quite explanatory.Here, though, is a précis of the argument. (It's worth noting that Darwin had expanded chapter explanations in his table of contents, effectively working as a rudimentary index.)Chapter 3. Microbes help build body. Vital functions have been outsourced because microbes are so ubiquitous.Chapter 4. Reintroduces the idea that microbes are neither inherently good nor bad, and even pathological effects can result from certain conditions--in the same way that landscapes can support different kinds of living communities, depending upon their conditions.Chapter 5. Sickness, in people, other organisms, and entire ecosystems, can result from disruptions in the microbial flora. Chapter 6. Animals and their microbes co-evolved.Chapter 7. Because microbes can do so many functions, their coming together with certain organisms allows those organisms to expand into new niches relatively easily. Chapter 8. Genes can be transferred horizontally, from organism to organism.Chapters 9 and 10. The future, and the possibility of microbial engineering.The real reason, though, that it is so difficult to parse out the overall narrative arc is that Yong is in love with the smaller-scale stories. He has been a blogger and writer of magazine articles for many years now, and this experience shows here--to the detriment of the book, I think. With the exception of a few, the chapters do not really lay out a cohesive arguments, but are divided by stories. Again and again, just as Yong is building up to a point, he will take a break and start a new story--with new characters and new creatures.In short, the ideas that are supposed to be driving the story are pushed aside for the story of people. And in the end, the narrative falls between two stools, neither fully the laying out of an idea, nor a group biography, but something in between, and fractured.Apart from making it hard to develop much momentum and to see the forest for the trees, this fragmenting of the book ends up bringing up a whole host of questions that Yong can never really address. Does it matter that one researcher is far from home when she meets with him? Why is another's son hitting Yong in the rear end? Does it matter when World War II was? Talk about conditions leading to (or foreclosing) disease ties into alternative notions of medicine--how does this change in view of microbes relate? Why do Westerners live in an environment that promotes inflammation? Aren't there neo-colonialist concerns with researchers sampling poop from malnourished children? What are the implications of engineering the microbial flora--haven't we learned from big ecological engineering projects?Popular science writing likes to emphasize the humans involved in the science, the work they do, the ideas they have, their personalities and quirks. I get it. But I think the tendency makes it harder to see what Yong is trying to say here. The book is not equipped to answer these questions, and the stories tend to obscure Yong's Darwinian ambitions.Still, he makes some valuable caveats and interventions. As anyone who only half pays attention to debates over nutrition will know, microbes are a big deal--probiotics make lots of money, people are all into feeding the right bugs, and one part of the whole fascination over gluten-free diets is concerns over leaky guts and microbes slipping into the bloodstream. Yong shows how limited the evidence for this talk is, though--particularly probiotics--and as soon as someone starts telling you the exact composition of microbe you need, you should be very wary.And, really, the stories are still fascinating. This last part is what most reviewers I've noticed have focused on, and they are not wrong. Yong got gold of a great subject, and hunted down a huge number of really interesting stories that fit the project. The amount of work that went into the book must have been immense.And, really, when you think of all those accomplishments, it seems churlish to complain that Yong wasn't Darwin also."
170,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"This is a fun read!Each one of us is a microbiome, with billions of bacteria literally on every bit of our skin and hair. Inside our bodies and in our cells, we have even more interesting little microscopic monsters. Plus, we share these little bugs with everyone we meet, especially the people we live with. If you have a dog, the volume of bacteria in your home increases exponentially. If, gentle reader, you are now scratching and twitching, may I suggest getting a copy of 'I Contain Multitudes' so at least you will know how bacteria function, and why we have them in us, on us, and everywhere else. Author Ed Yong writes for the general reader, explaining that the majority of bacteria are helpful. Good thing, eh? My skin is still crawling. Literally. Anybody else feel like hitting the shower for a good scrub?Author Ed Yong humorously explores the microbiological universe we live in. Several chapters explain that bacteria were the first forms of life on Earth, at least as far as we know, by describing the historical record scientists have sussed out through DNA research. He delves into how some of the more interesting bacteria were discovered, and how scientists are currently exploring how bacteria can be used to improve health. Reader, it is obvious after finishing this book being a hypochondriac is an exercise in futility. If it makes you feel any better, most bacteria are our friends. The Earth would be just rock, water and gas fumes without 'em. So. Learn to love your little invisible pets. They certainly love you. You truly are never alone.'I Contain Multitudes' has an extensive Bibliography and an Index. I read the Kindle ebook, which collected the included photos in the back."
171,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"This book is jam-packed with tons of information about the recently uncovered world of microbes. Considering how many books about microbes are popping up, I was skeptical at first, but it quickly became apparent that this book was based on nothing but the best science available on the subject. Just like the Sonnenburgs' book Gut, I contain Multitudes focused on what we know about microbes and was very clear about the lack of evidence when speculating. The researchers cited by Yong are the best in their field. Who Yong *does not cite* is very telling. If you look for an author in Yong's citations (or in the Sonneburgs' citations) and that author is not there, do not trust their book at face value. You will notice that not one reputable microbe researcher and/or book author cites Grain Brain's Perlmutter, whose entire book is made up of misconceptions, sensational claims, and pseudoscience. Some of the most interesting parts of this book include: - Yong's very favorite microbe, Wolbachia, is a fairly magical creature. It is too big to fit into sperm and be passed down through the generations. It can only be carried in eggs. So what is Wolbachia to do if it wants to survive and pass down its genes? Well, it must ensure that as many females as possible survive to carry on its line. Accordingly, it controls the sex of many species as possible (especially arthropods). It either kills the males or alters them in some way to help itself spread through the population. Wolbachia stop female wasps from mating with males. When infected with Wolbachia, the females choose to clone instead. But, if you give the females an antibiotic to wipe out Wolbachia, they begin having sex with males again.In woodlice, Wolbachia interfere with the production of male hormones, ensuring that all woodlice are female or that male woodlice transformed into females. In Blue Moon butterflies Wolbachia kill male embryos, resulting in females outnumbering males by 100 to 1.In other species still, Wolbachia alter sperm in males so that they can only fertilize eggs infected with Wolbachia. (brilliant)Wolbachia is insanely successful, with infections rates often at 100% of the population. The majority of living creatures are arthropods, and 40% of arthropods are infected.- Once it was thought that no microbes could survive conditions at deep ocean vents. However, researchers found myriad forms of life at the vents. There is a worm that has no mouth or anus. To take in nutrients and expel waste products, these worms use the microbes that fill up their bodies. The microbes turn sulfur into the energy (what amazing alchemists!) that maintain the life of the worms, who live without the direct energy of sunlight. - Breastmilk is not for babies. It is to feed the microbes inside babies that are essential for baby's wellbeing and feed the viruses inside babies (the very viruses that make baby sick). - There are no good or bad microbes (this part was simply fantastic). In one species a microbe can be helpful and ""bad"" in another species who it harms. Even in the same individual, microbes are not good or bad. For example, gut bacteria is great.... in the gut. But if it travels to the blood, you have sepsis and die. The bacteria that caused the sepsis isn't ""bad."" It is simply in the wrong place to do its job. When in the blood, it does the same job it does in the intestine, but that is good for the functioning of the gut (and the parts of the body governed by gut microbes) is bad for the bloodstream. Sprinkled throughout the book was the message that, in nature, moderation is key. When is it good to wipe out all microbes? When is it not? How can we know what types of microbes (and at what concentration) are good for which circumstances. - Herbivores have the highest diversity of gut microbes, omnivores had second highest, and carnivores the lowest. Why should this be? Shouldn't animals that eat both plants and animals have more diverse microbes than an animal that only eats plants? Animals that eat only plants need the greatest variety of microbes because it takes tons of enzymes to break down plants but not nearly as much to break down animals. Plants have lot of cellulose and carbs, which are hard to break down. So plant eaters need microbes in great diversity and abundance to accomplish that task.It's funny, but you can think of herbivores as actual mouths. They do the eating of the plant. Their superior microbes break down the plants (just as a mouth and teeth break down food so you can swallow and digest it). Another animal, an omnivore or carnivore, comes along and eats what has essentially already been chewed and broken down. When the omnivore or carnivore eat the herbivore, they have saved themselves the work of breaking down the food. It's done for them. They merely chew it up some more to break it into small enough pieces so their intestine, which has far fewer microbes, can relax and just finish the job of digesting the plants (which hold the sun's energy!) that the herbivore and its microbes already did the hard work of breaking down. Yong gave many excellent examples of various strategies different animals species used for helping guts and microbes work in tandem to digest food. "
172,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"You may think that we are just made from muscles, blood cells, bones and a fair bit of DNA, but in between the gaps are microbes. Billions and billions of them. There are the odd rogue ones, but most of them are useful and make up an essential element of our being. Without them we could not live. They help us in countless ways, sculpting our organs, protecting us from disease and feeding and nourishing us; our gut contains a complete ecosystem that ensure that we extract all the energy we need.Microbes work equal miracles in other animals too, providing the ethereal light that disguises a squid as they hunt, ensuring that koalas are able to digest the unpalatable eucalyptus leaves and the weevil that uses bacteria to make its shell before killing them. The modern worldview of eliminating all microbes is causing as much harm as it is good; people nowdays have a revulsion of all things bacterial, hence the raft of cleaning products that are designed to scour all surfaces and hands clean of these unwanted intruders. However, as Yong successfully argues in this book that not only we might be missing a trick, but our bacterial ecosystem is essential for our survival. A good example of this is in hospitals; the modern view is that all windows have to be locked shut to keep rogue microbes out, but the effect of this is that patients sit in their beds stewing in a lethal mix of micro-organisms. This hazardous situation can be simply solved by opening a window, this allows the dispersal and dilution of the potentially lethal ones. Simple, but very effective.It is a fascinating account of the unseen creatures that live within and all around us. Yong takes us on this journey through the microscope to discover the most recent research from scientists all round the world and tell us of the secrets that are being discovered about microbes. Some of the treatments being developed have the potential to make people’s so lives much better; one example is RePOOpulate – as unappealing as it sounds! However, this treatment has worked miracles with a 94% success rate and no side effects, a success rate not seen in many other cures. Yong writes with an engaging and eloquent style and makes the science in here really accessible. Well worth reading. 4.5 stars."
173,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"Ed Yong is a London-based science writer for The Atlantic and is part of National Geographic’s blogging network. I had trouble believing that I Contain Multitudes is his first book; it’s so fluent and engaging that it immediately draws you into the microbial world and keeps you marveling at its strange yet fascinating workings. Yong writes like a journalist rather than a scientist, and that’s a good thing: with an eye to the average reader, he uses a variety of examples and metaphors, intersperses personal anecdotes of visiting researchers at their labs or in the field, and is careful to recap important facts in a lucid way.The book opens with a visit to San Diego Zoo (see the exclusive extract following my review), where we meet Baba the pangolin. But “Baba is not just a pangolin. He is also a teeming mass of microbes,” Yong explains. “Some of them live inside him, mostly in his gut. Others live on the surface of his face, belly, paws, claws, and scales.” Believe it or not, but we are roughly half and half human cells and microbial cells, making each of us – like all creatures – more of an ecosystem (another term is “holobiont”) than a single entity.Microbes vary between species but also within species, so each individual’s microbiome in some ways reflects a unique mixture of genes and experiences. This is why people’s underarms smell subtly different, and how hyenas use their scent glands to convey messages. The microbiome may well be tailored to different creatures’ functions, so researchers at San Diego Zoo are testing swabs from their animals to see if there could be discernible signatures for burrowing or flying activities, or for disease. I was struck by the breadth of species considered here: not just mammals, but also invertebrates like beetles, cicadas, and squid – my entomologist husband would surely be proud. The “Us” in the subtitle is thus used very inclusively to speak of the way that microbes live in symbiosis with all living things.If I were to boil down Yong’s book to one message, it’s that microbes are not simply “bad” or “good” but have different roles depending on the context and the host. You can hardly dismiss all bacteria as germs that must be eradicated when there are thousands of benign species in your gut (versus fewer than 100 kinds that cause infectious diseases). If it weren’t for the microbes passed on to us at birth, we wouldn’t be able to digest the complex sugars in our mothers’ milk. Other creatures rely on bacteria to help them develop to adulthood, like the tube worms that thrive on Navy ship hulls at Pearl Harbor.Yet Yong feels too little attention is given to beneficial microbes, and in many cases we continue the campaign to rid ourselves of them through overuse of antibiotics and taking cleanliness to unhelpful extremes. “We have been tilting at microbes for too long, and created a world that’s hostile to the ones we need,” he asserts.The book is full of lines like that one that combine a nice turn of phrase and a clever literary allusion. In the title alone, after all, you have references to Walt Whitman (“I contain multitudes” is from his “Song of Myself”) and Charles Darwin (“there is grandeur in this view of life” is part of the closing sentence in his On the Origin of Species). Yong also sets up helpful analogies, comparing the immune system to a thermostat and antibiotics to “shock-and-awe weapons … like nuking a city to deal with a rat.”History and future are also brought together very effectively, with the narrative looking backwards to Leeuwenhoek’s early microscope work and Pasteur and Koch’s germ theory, but also forwards to the prospects that current research into microbes might enable: eliminating elephantiasis, protecting frogs from deadly fungi via probiotics in the soil, fecal microbiota transplants to cure C. diff infections, and so on.The possibilities seem endless, and this is a book that will keep you shaking your head in amazement. I’d liken Yong’s style to David Quammen’s or Rebecca Skloot’s. His clear and intriguing science writing succeeds in inspiring wonder at the natural world and at the bodies that carry us through it.I participated in the official Wellcome Book Prize 2017 blog tour. See my blog review at Bookish Beck for an exclusive extract from the book."
174,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"I Contain Multitudes is science writing at its best: Ed Yong is curious and energetic, and his enthusiasm for bacteria (and wordplay) runneth over in this wide-ranging look at microbiomes within and without. The Whitman-inspired title is apt: we drift through a world teeming with bacteria. Our nonhuman bacterial denizens number in the trillions, and like Pigpen from Peanuts we exude a cloud of our own making, aerosolizing some 37 million bacteria per hour. Yong is quick to dispel the oft-cited back-of-the-napkin calculation that bacterial cells outnumber human cells 10-to-1. The best recent estimates render that split more evenly: roughly 39 trillion microbial cells to 30 trillion [significantly larger] human cells. Still, the point remains that we are hybrid creatures. If there is one takeaway message, it is that bacteria have gotten a bad rap due to our fixation on pathogens. Fewer than 100 bacterial species cause infectious disease in humans, compared to thousands of species [in our guts alone] that range from harmless to essential. If bacteria were to suddenly disappear, life would come to a quick and crashing halt. We need bacteria to digest, to supplement nutrients, to fight infection, and to offload hosts of other responsibilities we are evolved to depend upon.While the book is chock full of interesting factoids (your right hand shares just a sixth of its microbial species with your left hand!) and canvasses the history of human discovery of the microscopic world, most information comes in the form of Yong's interactions with researchers. We learn about connections between bacteria and immunity, and potential developmental connections to autism and schizophrenia. We look at the ever-raging battle between farmers and parasites, and how bacteria can be wielded by aggressor and defender alike. There's a lot of information on the bacteria we inherit from our mothers as we pass through the birth canal, as well as the purpose of milk for a developing child (it feeds important bacteria as well as the baby). We witness tests with bacteria-free mice, swabbed zoo animals, gene sequencing, computer simulations, and various other methods of isolating the causes and effects of bacterial strains. We learn about commercial products that do and do not help (for example, probiotics make sense in theory, but the popular brands do either nothing at all or very little). We are shown the dangerous effects of overusing antibacterial products (themselves bi-products of bacterial warfare) and our misguided attempts to sanitize our environments [read: hospitals] completely. We learn the power of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to both explain much of evolutionary history, to blur the lines between species and genomes, and to give us a potential leg up against parasites. Yong chronicles some successful examples of engineering (such as infecting mosquitos with neutral Wolbachia to combat Dengue fever, or applying transplanted rumen to help Austalian livestock eat Leucaena without consequence), but also some of the ongoing problems like pine beetle forest destruction. We hold our noses while applauding the remarkable promise of fecal transplantation, especially for C-diff, and the ongoing work to address other conditions like IBS and colitis.Yong shares leading theories, discredited theories, promising research, ongoing debates, and a lot of the nuance you don't always get from popular science writing. He's a gifted communicator, and can't resist side commentary with a lot of juicy science and good sense. With each discovery, it becomes readily apparent that we've barely scratched the surface and that quick assumptions and preliminary results almost always mislead, giving way to deeper understanding with ongoing research. Further investigation into the bacterial world will result in exciting advancements in health, materials, food, and a variety of other fields. I hope many people read this and are inspired to join in on the discovery."
175,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6894205-allie,4,"Utterly fascinating. Review to come, once I pick up the pieces of my brain and assemble some coherent thoughts."
176,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32913415-laura,5," When Orson Welles said ""We're born alone, we live alone, we die alone"", he was mistaken. Even when we are alone, we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis--a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. Some animals are colonized by microbes while they are still unfertilized eggs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then proceed through our lives in their presence. When we eat, so do they. When we travel, they come along. When we die, they consume us. Every one of us is a zoo in our own right--a colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collective. An entire world. ~~microscopic view of bacteria on the human tongueEd Yong takes us into an absolutely fascinating world--the unseen world of microscopic life. These tiny life forms were first glimpsed by a Dutchman, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, who thought to look at a drop of water through his handmade lens in the 1660's. He went on to publish detailed drawings of his findings. They garnered him intense attention and fame, and he went on to become a Fellow of the Royal Society. However, he never taught anyone else how to make his superior lenses, and when he died...and his collection went missing...interest waned. But then came the late 1700's and Louis Pasteur. He, along with Robert Koch, did meticulous work showing that bacteria are responsible for diseases formerly attributed to ""bad air"". So microbes permanently entered the lime light, but have been cast, almost exclusively, as a villein. ""It didn't help that just before this wave of discoveries, in 1859, one Charles Darwin had published  On the Origin of Species . 'Through this historical accident, the germ theory of disease developed during the gory phase of Darwinism, where the interplay between living things was regarded as a struggle for survival, when one had to be friend or foe, with no quarter given,' wrote microbiologist Rene Dubos. 'This attitude molded, from the beginning, all later attempts to control microbial diseases. It led to a kind of aggressive warfare against the microbes, aimed at their elimination from the sick individual and the community."" I am, as a registered nurse, a product of this culture. We in modern medicine are proud of the largely successful warfare that we have waged against infectious disease. We've come a VERY long ways from the days in which surgeons, covered in gore, wiped their saw on their apron, and then moved on to their next victim/patient. We maintain meticulous sterile fields. We ""foam in/foam out"" to kill all microbes on our hands before touching patients. We autoclave equipment and sanitize hospital rooms. We prescribe antibiotics for true bacterial infections...and many infections that don't require these weapons. In short, we've solved giant disease and pestilence problems, prolonging human life by decades in the process, but created other issues. We're only now acknowledging the seriousness of these new issues, and the science behind why eradicating bacteria might not be such a good idea.Ed Yong, while not taking sides per se, nevertheless presents a plethora of evidence supporting the beneficial aspects of bacterial life. Yes, infectious disease is still a menace. Yes, antibiotics still save lives every day. However, most bacteria do not cause diseases (except in profoundly immunocompromised hosts), but they crowd out harmful pathogens on surfaces--kitchen counters as well as our skin, toilet seats as well as our guts. Overuse of antibacterial products not only promotes resistant strands of bacteria, it also kills the non-pathogenic organisms...leaving a vacuum that is filled by the most aggressive micro-organisms. But bacteria do far more than simply live on surfaces. They digest food that we can't digest ourselves, they allow squid to glow, they protect insects from predators, they provide the scent in glands which many different animals use to communicate, and they can block the malaria parasite from infecting mosquitoes. In fact, there is compelling evidence that chloroplasts and mitochondria are domesticated bacteria which now cannot live outside plant/animal cells. It would seem that the fate of animal/plant life and bacteria are entwined, for better or for worse. Yong shows ""the long waltz"" that our species have engaged in. Through natural selection bacteria evolve to better serve their hosts, and we (plants/animals) evolve to depend more and more on our bacterial companions. But while the four eukaryotic kingdoms (protists, fungi, plants, and animals) evolve at a rate that isn't particularly noticeable until many generations, bacteria can evolve at an amazingly rapid pace. They can evolve to allow rodents to eat plants that would otherwise be poisonous to them for example. This aspect of bacteria is fascinating to those in the biomed field--where researchers are hoping to discover new ways of combating diseases such as ulcerative colitis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. Far from being the enemy, many bacteria actually have the potential to save us.  My two cents : My above rambling review has barely scratched the surface how mind-blowing Yong's book is. Read this offering to see how complex and down right amazing our world is. Given 5 stars or a rating of ""Perfect"". Highly, highly recommended!!  Further Reading:  Here's a very good article from the National Institutes of Health on beneficial microbes--https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...~~Here's a fascinating look at the newest kingdom, Archaea, from the University of California, Berkley --https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/archaea/arc...~~A link to the University of Utah's page on the evolution of the cell...and an emerging theory of the origins of chloroplasts/mitochondria--https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/conte...~~Finally, H.G. Wells incorporated bacteria into the plot of his novel The War of the Worlds over 100 years ago. I *loved* his ending. But now, the part of me who finds sci-fi interesting has to ask, after reading  I Contain Multitudes , what if we (meaning plants/animals) have evolved to serve as walking vessels for bacteria? What if we serve them instead of the other way around? It's *ahem* food for thought. After all, new research shows that food cravings might be caused by the bacteria in our gut!"

178,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"“Forget Orson Welles, and heed Walt Whitman: “I am large, I contain multitudes.”“'Each animal is an ecosystem with legs,' says John Rawls.""“As palaeontologist Andrew Knoll once said, 'Animals might be evolution's icing, but bacteria are really the cake.'""Yep, Ed Yong knows how to salt and pepper his writing with some good quotes. He also pens some wonderful great-for-quoting prose himself: ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars.""“Within 24 hours of moving into a new place we overwrite it with our own microbes, turning it into a reflection of ourselves.”Yong is a great storyteller and gracefully covers a whole, er, host of topics. This is a broad-ranging book that still manages to go to fantastic depths (at which, by the way, there are many micro-organisms. Exremophiles in particular know how to go where no human has gone before, though we seem to be improving our methods of travel...)Imagine being the first person (known) to look at pond water through a microscope. You see critters moving all around and you think you're seeing things. You try again and again and star looking at all sorts of stuff. Anything you can think of. And almost everywhere you look, these little beings are zipping around. All of a sudden you realize there is a world of activity, an unknown world (or worlds) that has been there all along and their influence and importance is likely on a grand scale. It is kind of a complement to the realization that the earth revolves around the sun (i.e. it's not all about us) and that our solar system is just a few small dots in a vast network of galaxies.Yong follows the first known microscopist (to see microorganisms) into wonder and awe, and then death, and when he dies, Yong follows him back into obscurity (for one or two-hundred years?). And he brings us to the next wave of scientists studying these organisms. He talks of the theories over hundreds or thousands of years used to try to explain the work of microorganisms that was, at that point, invisible, and then brings us closer and closer to the present, as our understanding that microbes affect us grows and yet our comprehension of their intelligence, complexity and range of activity and influence often lags behind. Knowledge is anything but forward moving. There are people who lived thousands of years ago who knew much more about science than many people today. Mostly because people let inflexible (and in my experience, often dangerous) assumptions and ideologies get in the way of processes of learning and, perhaps more importantly, unlearning. For, in order to learn something new, to see something, even if is highy visible and evidence of it is incontrovertible, we often must let go of previously held notions. Yong's book is a testament to all the ways humans are wrong about things, and the endless specificity and self-importance of our vision that makes more omniscient forms of knowledge and wisdom impossible. We are always struggling to understand the world we live in, and we are often failing to see how powerful we are and yet how fallible, vulnerable and small. I wish I could write a better, more thorough review. I listened to this book on audio and I didn't take notes. Or, if I did, I cannot find them. But one of my favorite sections of the book was about worms. The work they do in the soil (and the long-term productivity of organic farming that works in collaboration with them), the revolutionary potential for use of worms to make waste management much more sustainable. And there was an interesting section on the microbiome/microbial communities in houses and hospitals as well as in the body. How trying to kill microbes is much more dangerous than trying to find a healthy balance of them. So much cool stuff in this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in illness and health (of self and community), in building balanced healthy ecosystems rather than trying to solve our problems by eradicating and flattening the communities of microbes in our midst. “Much of modern medicine is built upon the foundations that antibiotics provide, and those foundations are now crumbling.” Here is the list of chapters to give you a bit more of a sense of the trajectory:Living Islands (evolution of eukaryotes, a brief history of biological time)The People Who Thought To Look (Antony van Leeuwenhoek--early microscopists) Body Builders (and he's not talking about gyms.)Terms and Conditions Apply (our love affair with friendly microbes is not the kind of love that is unconditional. It is a lot of work to sustain healthy balances.)In Sickness And In HealthThe Long Waltz (how do symbiotic partnerships begin? How do they evolve?)Mutually Assured SuccessAllegro in E Major (microbes influence on the genome of other animals)Microbes A La Carte (trying to work with the microbiome to fight illness and create healthier body ecosystems)Tomorrow the World"

It is not the only literary reference and I truly appreciate that in a science writer.Yong gives the feeling of being on a safari, observing exotic wildlife. He makes single-celled organisms as interesting as wildebeest and lions. We have come a long way in understanding this part of the ecosystem, and we have miles to go before we perfect that knowledge.The microorganisms were here first. All of the multicellular animals & plants have evolved in concert with them and it should come as no surprise that we have vast colonies of microbes on us & in us. In fact, they are essential to our proper function—witness the microbe-free mice that researchers have created to experiment with these ideas. Their guts and immune systems don’t function properly and the animals don’t behave like normal animals either. Before reading this book, I had a much too simplistic view of the human microbiome. Now I know a number of the factors that can influence it (diet & antibiotics are only two of a long list) and that “good” bacteria can do bad things if the system is out of whack (dysbiosis, my new word for the month).Not to mention cool things like using bacterial infections to control mosquito-bourne diseases!Recommended reading."
180,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27456036-barbara,4,This book contains so much information one would need to reread and reread it and still not absorb it all. The history of microbe studies as well as very current research is fascinating. Ed Long does a great job using analogies to help the lay reader understand the complexities. Those interested in science and specifically microbes will enjoy this book.

So overall I enjoyed reading it.The reason for only three stars: the books structure is not great. He talks about an issue and revisits it again and again. It is lacking the flow, and feels like he is visiting the same points over and over again. I assume this is due to him writing a first lengthy book on a single subject. The narrative wanders a bit, and it is harder to follow from time to time.Also, some of the research presented in the book is preliminary and not conclusive. Even though he has a section on how we cannot infer cause-effect relationship of these findings, many instances of the book has premature conclusions.Overall, it was a fun to read book and taught me many new things. I recommend it, but do not expect this to be the ""best science book"" you'll read.I am sure with his talent and good storytelling skills he will get there, but this one is not it."

The population of Canada is (marginally) less than that. I can’t help but picture Pigpen from Charlie Brown walking around with his cloud of dirt. I also think what a great pity it is that the hospital I work in was designed with windows that are sealed shut, locking all of those pathogenic bacteria that we want to avoid inside with our patients. Think about that the next time you go to the hospital. "

188,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"Reading a straight pop-science book is a nice change, and even better when the book covers super-interesting material, as Ed Yong’s I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life does. Where Yong lays bare research into inter-species cooperation that’s changing scientist’s views about natural selection. In the classic evolutionary/ biological view, it’s “us” against “the world.” Life is a struggle, red in tooth and claw. While that is true, it ignores that adaptive success that cooperation often provides. But unlike macro-cooperation (like a tight-knit African village banding together to raise all of their children collectively, or Microsoft and Intel working together to benefit both companies), Yong focuses on microbiological cooperation. You know. Those “probiotics” yogurt and supplement companies are so keen to foist on us, overstating the potential benefits of eating Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Which, as Yong points out, seldom if ever survive our stomach acids. But Yong digs deeper than shallow pop-cultural gee whiz. For instance, he introduces a theory that a positive “bacterial infection” may have led to human’s increased brain-size. He finds the evidence in probiotics present in human infants, passed to the via their mothers, that increase brain size. What’s more, they break down chemicals in breast milk that neither our guts nor other probiotics can. He also discusses the bacterial adaptations of termites, and how bacteria, molds and algae band together to create a healthy environment for corals, which create a lush habitat for a healthy reef’s assorted flora and fauna.And then I Contain Multitudes delves deeper, highlighting the ecological collapse of the tight webs of interconnected lives. He traces many biological disturbances, from dying coral reefs to human bacterial infection, to “dysbiosis,” an imbalance of the ecological order. Sometimes this imbalance provides a new, more adaptive order, like how recovery from an illness protects us from that bug via antibodies. At other times, like in a dying coral reef or Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a dysbiosis can settle into a chilling, almost dead stasis.On a related, if and gross side-note that appeals to my inner 14-year-old science-geek (for the record, that’s many decades behind me), Yong spends a chapter discussing Fecal Microbiota Transplants. It’s as potty-humor funny as it sounds. Here, doctors (or alternative medicine quacks) shoot a slurry of healthy people’s poop into sick people’s rectums via a high-pressure enema. Though silly and gross-sounding, this procedure often cures dysbiotic ailments, such as Crohn’s Disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, albeit with risks. [FYI from my Inner Adult: Since there are risks, it's best to avoid alternative medical woo-woo and consult an MD for Fecal Matter Transplants. Which, despite the potty humor, is no laughing matter. Here’s a WebMD article that oulines the risk/ reward using the best available science: http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disord... ]My main criticism of the book is the gee-whiz visionaries and entrepreneurs, hoping to cash-in “using the science or probiotics” to create healthier human cityscapes and dwellings. Since scientific efforts like this have a storied history of failure. Like the kudzu that’s overtaking the southeast, which the Soil Erosion Service paid farmers to plant in fallow fields to avoid the next Dust Bowl, only to have it “take off,” overtaking about 2,500 acres of land in the south each year. Or the FDA introducing carp, a delicacy in European cuisines, as a source of farm income, only to discover that American-raised carp taste muddy compared to those raised in Europe. Problem was, byt the time they'd discovered this, carp eggs were “in the wild,” spreading like a plague, displacing native fish populations and destroying the habitat of others. These two failures of ""scientific solutions"" are illustrative: many more exist. So needless to say, this skeptic won’t hold his breath. Like the antibiotic craze that’s created or current dysbiosis and given rise to higher-than-average allergies, asthmas and other autoimmune diseases, this “cure” will likely create a new dysbiosis. Flaws (and new-fangled tech gee-whiz) aside, I enjoyed Ed Yong’s I Contain Multitudes. I recommend it without reservation to fans of science books. The material is engaging, new and interesting. And very important. I was tempted to give it five stars, but something held me back. So I’m going with my four-star (and probiotic rich) gut in saying “four-stars.” . "
189,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"The first paragraph of the book's description perfectly describes it for me. Yong didn't just tell me how important my microbiome is, by the end of book, I felt it. There he really missed a perfect picture for me - that of Pigpen from the Peanuts strip by Charles Shultz. We aren't discrete beings making our lonely way through the world, but continually changing clouds of bacteria influencing & being influenced by our surroundings plant, animal, & mineral due to our incredible ecologies. That's not an overstatement & Yong gives plenty of examples throughout the book.We didn't evolve in a vacuum, bacteria have constantly drenched every living organism. Most don't have much to do with us, but many find a home within the newcomers, the more complex hosts, & they act like good house guests. Sometimes they move in to stay & provide services (symbiot). Occasionally they get out of line (disbiosis) & far more rarely they're bad. He gives fascinating examples of all states.He really shined with his descriptions of how one variety mosquitoes are altered to not carry disease. I've heard about such efforts, but never knew any of the methods. He'd mentioned & had given enough details about the bacterial strain Wolbachia that when he got around to telling how scientists were infecting mosquitoes that carried Dengue fever with it in an attempt to eradicate the disease, it made perfect sense & I'm not a scientist of any sort. IOW, his explanations were all good & accessible.His discussion of balances within the microbiotic community were especially interesting to me since both my wife & daughter have stomach issues. I had no idea how much or quickly such things could change. A mere change in diet of a day can completely change the balance of our gut bacteria while a course of antibiotics can be catastrophic. Of course, we have to balance the risks of destroying gut bacteria against dying of another infection that the antibiotic is being taken for. Often there isn't a definite or even a good answer, but a guess based on probabilities. It's messy & defies simplification so beware of miracle cures. In a few decades a doctor might be able to tailor a bacterial cocktail for your particular symptoms & biome, but the science is in its infancy. One of the places it is starting is with Fecal Matter Transfer (FMT). Gross, but it's been routinely carried out for those whose systems are in such distress that they're losing weight & wearing diapers. A colonoscopy that plants a donor's poop up their own intestines often fixes the problem, at least for a time. Now they're refining this to cultures that are contained in a capsule. yes, they give out a poo pill! Apparently our species' aversion to eating poo isn't exactly the norm in the animal kingdom. Rabbits & rats have to eat their own or else they get a vitamin deficiency. Other species regularly eat other's poo & it's one way beneficial bacteria spread & inoculate them. It can also lead to similar smells among them fostering a sense of community. Who knew? Fascinating!I was really surprised by the example of Sea World keeping the dolphin's water too clean. Anyone who has had an aquarium knows it takes a while to balance the system & clear up the water. It's not dirt, but the bio-balance, so it's often best to start a new tank by taking water from an existing aquarium. I never changed more than 1/3 of the water per week, a rule of thumb that was told to me early on by seemingly everyone. Ivory tower syndrome?While this is rather long & sagged a bit about 2/3-3/4 of the way through (at least I wandered a bit) I highly recommend reading it all the way through. The end is great & well worth the journey. My edition was well narrated & easily understood. I did get the ebook to refer to, but didn't have to very often - mostly just for the name & spelling of some terms & names.Highly recommended!"
190,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna,5,"This was a fascinating book. I’ve heard of gut microbiota and faecal microbiome transfer, but there was tons of new information. One of the most important concepts for me was that the microbiome is necessary for the normal development and functioning of higher organisms. One of the main targets for research is the gut:“The weird biology of germ-free animals is most obvious in the gut. A well-functioning gut needs a big surface area for absorbing nutrients, which is why its walls are densely lined with long, finger-like pillars. It needs to constantly regenerate the cells at its surface, which get sloughed off by the passing tide of food. It needs a rich network of underlying blood vessels to carry nutrients to and fro. And it needs to be sealed – its cells must stick tightly to each other to prevent foreign molecules (and microbes) from leaking into those blood vessels. All of these essential properties are compromised without microbes.If zebrafish or mice grow up in the absence of bacteria their guts don’t develop fully, (which) can be rectified simply by giving the animals a normal complement of microbes or even isolated microbial molecules. The bacteria don’t physically reshape the gut themselves. Instead, they work via their hosts...Lora Hooper demonstrated this by infusing into germ-free mice a common gut bacterium called Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron – or B-theta to its friends. She found that the microbe activated a wide range of mouse genes that are involved in absorbing nutrients, building an impermeable barrier, breaking down toxins, creating blood vessels, and creating mature cells.”The microbiome is also essential in the early development and the normal functioning of the mature immune system:… an animal’s genome doesn’t provide everything it needs to create a mature immune system. It also needs input from a microbiome. Hundreds of scientific papers, on species as diverse as mice, tsetse flies and zebrafish, have shown that microbes help to shape the immune system in some way. They influence the creation of entire classes of immune cells, and the development of organs that make and store those cells. They are especially important early in life, when the immunity machine is first constructed and tunes itself to the big, bad world. And once the machine is chugging away, microbes continue to calibrate its reactions to threats.I found it fascinating that breast milk doesn’t just contain antibodies to protect the infant, it also contains special oligosaccharides: „scientists have identified over 200 human milk oligosaccharides, or HMOs, so far” that the infant can’t digest. Breast-fed infants carry Bifidobacteria in their guts. “HMOs are not an all-purpose food for Bifs. [] the sugars selectively nourish one particular subspecies called Bifidobacterium longum infantis, or B. infantis for short. As long as you provide it with HMOs, it will outcompete any other gut bacterium.” [] As it digests HMOs, B. infantis releases short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that feed an infant’s gut cells – so while mothers nourish this microbe, the microbe in turn nourishes the baby. Through direct contact, B. infantis also encourages gut cells to make adhesive proteins that seal the gaps between them, and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system.”There are also chapters dealing with how microbes play a role in the life and death of coral reefs, symbionts in insects, how symbiosis is a precarious balance and only advantageous when the microbes are in the right place at the right time… I could go on, but you must read it yourself. I think it will be an engrossing read for anyone who is interested in science, symbiosis, evolution, ecology, hygiene…"
191,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1192324-ana,5,"This will be a difficult book to review, because I find myself short of words to express how good it is! Ed Yong is a science journalist and an amazing story teller. He masters the difficult art of delivering detailed and scientifically accurate information in an agreeable way, without scaring away the layman reader while satisfying someone with knowledge in the field as well. In fact, he manages to make it so interesting that I often found myself glued to the pages and sometimes reading parts of the text aloud to my daughters.Yong’s erudition is visible in many ways, including the several links he makes with literature, which begin right with the title of the book, a verse taken from a poem by Walt Whitman, ”Song to myself”.In the introduction, Yong describes a visit to a zoo with a microbiologist, to collect samples from a white-bellied pangolin – in his words, “an utterly endearing animal that looks like a cross between an anteater and a pine cone.” What starts like a novel, quickly gives way to an overview of the different types of microbes that live on, within and around every animal. We find ourselves amazed by the variety and ubiquity of these beings and we know we’re trapped: our curiosity has been stirred and we will not stop reading this book!The first chapter of the book is a summary of the evolution of life on Earth, framing the appearance of the human being in relation to other life forms, and especially single-cell ones:“All the visible organisms we’re familiar with, everything that springs to mind when we think of ‘nature’, are latecomers to life’s story. For most of the tale, microbes were the only living things on Earth” (more precisely, from March to October, in an imaginary calendar that we can use if we collapse the planet’s entire 4.54 billion years old history into one year, to make it manageable by our brains; in this calendar, humans have only existed for the last 30 min of December 31).The second chapter is a condensed historical overview of the “discovery” of microbes by man and the way knowledge and our general perception of this group has evolved. It finishes with a visit to a museum in the Netherlands dedicated to microscopic life, that I absolutely need to visit: Micropia (https://www.micropia.nl/en/)From here onwards, each chapter follows the work and the recent discoveries of scientists working in different parts of the world with different microbe groups and applications (ecology, agriculture, human health…). I am not making a summary or giving away any spoilers, but suffice to say that although I am not a complete layman in this field, I still found myself amazed and fascinated enough to ponder enrolling on a microbiology online course just to freshen up my long forgotten and outdated knowledge in this field.As far as I could find out, this was Ed Yong’s first book. I can’t wait to read his next one, although I am prepared to wait, as I am sure books like these take a very long time to write. This is very clear from the dozens of people he interviewed, laboratories he visited and publications he consulted. The book has around 70 pages of notes and bibliography, which I found myself constantly referring to.For those who are still thinking whether they should read this book, I am leaving a link to a talk given by Ed Yong himself about his book on the day it was published. I am sure he will convince you himself:https://edyong.me/i-contain-multitudes/"

I read this as part of the May #AsianReadathon, and listened to the audiobook which is well narrated by Charlie Anson.I loved biology as a kid, and was that kid who read every single book she could get her hands on. So much so, that my Mom, a Bio and Chemistry teacher, had to keep them away from me so I would study other subjects. This wonderful book took me back to those days of sheer delight and wonderment at learning such cool stuff.This nonfiction book is wide reaching in scope, but takes deep dives on specific themes. Homo Sapiens often forget that we are relatively really late to this game called life, and that microbes have been around (and dominant) for much, much, much longer. It should then not be a surprise that all other life forms evolved with/around microbes. It's not news today that we are all covered (internally and externally) with trillions of microbes, but it's not often that we look at the world from the microbes point of view. This book explores the history, zoology, ecology, and biology of microbes and how they affect every single living thing on the planet in a myriad of ways. We often tend to focus on the bad guys - the pathogens - but that's like learning about terrorists, and assuming all that kind of people are terrorists. Not remotely true. I was educated, entertained, entranced, my mental maps where changed, and I will never look the world the same again. It was rather like a flat lander learning that the planet is not in fact flat. I do not exaggerate. The writing is really good, and covers a lot of ground in an easily digestible manner without dumbing things down. I appreciated the author's respect for the people on the front lines of the field, and the humor interspersed throughout. I loved every minute. I just learned the author covers science for The Atlantic, and I've added all his articles to my TBR list.Why might you care about microbes you ask? Well, from the book blurb: Many people think of microbes as germs to be eradicated, but those that live with us—the microbiome—build our bodies, protect our health, shape our identities, and grant us incredible abilities. You choose to remain ignorant at your own peril!"

This book goes into a lot of detail about the symbiosis between the microbes and other organisms, humans and animals. They are essential for life in all aspects, in digestion, our immune systems, and every other aspect of life. We would not be here today without them. It is also important to know that most microbes are not harmful. We have become so fixated on getting rid of them by too many antibiotics and too much antibacterial soaps and overly hygienic conditions that it is to our detriment. Antibiotics must be taken with care and only when necessary. Bacteria have been around forever and we have learned about them since Louis Pasteur and other microbiologists but with the new technologies of gene sequencing and genomics, it is now possible to sequence every gene and get a complete detail of every microbiome. With our understanding of evolution, we know that all life has co-evolved within close contact with microbes. And with our fast expanding knowledge of these microbes, we are learning how to eradicate diseases and learn how to live with them symbiotically.This book covers a very interesting array of topics about microbes in an understandable way and is for you if you are interested in microbiology."

A world that pre-existed the one of all more complicated life forms and that every other creature has had to accommodate to.I’m on day five of influenza and am sorely not up to writing the titillating review this book deserves. I am hoping my virus infection does not result in a bacterial infection that would need antibiotics. Bacteria evolve at a blistering speed by gene transfer, so resistance is almost instantaneous. Furthermore, a dose of antibiotics would put my gut microbes into havoc, possibly decimating the colonies I would like to keep and let more nasty ones settle. But no, you cannot treat a viral infection itself with antibiotics! Please! Our microbiomes aren’t inherently good or bad. There is no such thing as a good bug or a bad bug. Some play along the entire scale anyway. What has become clear is that our obsession with cleanliness is counterproductive, causing autoimmune diseases such as asthma. We need to train our immune systems to not be jittery and overreact.This book deserves to be read. It’s well told and entertaining, while being immensely informative."
198,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,4,"If you’re a physician, a nutritionist, or have studied biology, you’re probably aware that our bodies contain an immense number of microbes. Most of the rest of us find that surprising. Though I knew about the bugs that inhabit my digestive system, British science journalist Ed Yong helped me understand just how numerous and widely dispersed those microbes are on my body—and yours. Try 39 trillion. That number’s greater than the estimated number of human cells in our bodies. And it’s 100 times as great as the largest estimate of the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. In other words, it’s an understatement to say that the number of microbes we contain is astronomical.Should we fear the microbes within us?Now, before you panic about the many diseases you’ll contract from all these bugs, rest assured. “There are fewer than 100 species of bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans,” as Yong explains in I Contain Multitudes. “By contrast, the thousands of species in our guts are mostly harmless.” And a great many of them play indispensable roles in keeping us alive and disease-free. They bolster our immune system, digest our food, and even help make us who we are.How did this come about? “Remember that animals emerged in a world that had already been teeming with microbes for billions of years,” Yong notes. “They were the rulers of the planet long before we arrived. And when we did arrive, of course we evolved ways of interacting with the microbes around us.”The world within usThe collection of microbes in each of us is generally called the microbiome. Yong explains its functions and its fathomless diversity in conversational English with occasional flashes of humor. “Every one of us is a zoo in our own right,” he writes. “A colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collective. An entire world. . . Some species are common, but none is everywhere.” And that collection of species is unique to each of us. The microbes in my gut and on my skin are very different from those in and on you. Not only that but “your right hand shares just a sixth of its microbial species with your left hand.”The symbiosis spectrumThe theme of I Contain Multitudes is symbiosis. In common parlance, symbiosis suggests mutual benefit. Technically, though, the meaning is broader. “If one partner benefited at the expense of the other, it was a parasite (or a pathogen if it caused disease). If it benefited without affecting its host, it was a commensal. If it benefited its host, it was a mutualist. All these styles of coexistence fell under the rubric of symbiosis.” Yong’s book includes a huge number of examples, not just within our own bodies but in animals and plants as well. If you have an affinity for science, you’ll love this book.By the way, “there is no such thing as a ‘good microbe’ or a ‘bad microbe’ . . . In reality, bacteria exist along a continuum of lifestyles, between ‘bad’ parasites and ‘good’ mutualists. Some microbes . . . slide from one end of the parasite-mutualist spectrum to the other, depending on the strain, and on the host they find themselves in.” The possibilities of these combinations are endless.The ever-evolving field of biologyYong will take you on a tour of the laboratories where scientists study symbiosis and its effects on its many hosts in other living things. You’ll meet the pioneers in the field—a fascinating lot, few of whom match the stereotype of the frizzy-haired, absent-minded professor. You’ll learn about the emerging fields of biogeography, metagenomics, and synthetic biology. And you’ll see how the discoveries in these fields are benefiting medical science—and portend more advances in the future.The title of this engrossing book is from Walt Whitman: “I am large. I contain multitudes.”About the authorBorn Edmund Soon-Weng Yong in 1981, Ed Yong is a staff member of The Atlantic.

199,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/563794-amy,5,"I originally encountered this book when ordering it for a class at the high school where I work. I have to think that if I had read this book in high school, my life would have taken a different trajectory. I find the world of bacteria and fungi to be ridiculously fascinating. Since I started reading this book, I’ve started reading microbiology textbooks and even joined a local mycology society. I’m not sure what I can do with all of this fascination at this point in my life, but here I am. I made 102 highlights in this book. Where in the world do I start? First of all, I think it’s important to clear up the misconception microbes are mainly disease-causing germs. Viruses cause diseases, but fewer than 100 bacteria actually cause diseases. So many of them work in symbiosis with the creatures that they inhabit making them healthier overall. Many have evolved with their hosts. Some of the more interesting ones discussed in the book are microbes that work inside insects to do things that the insects couldn't do on their own (such as the protozoa inside termites which help to digest wood). I could read an entire book on microbes inside insects and be happy. One of the more intriguing microbes that works in our favor is the bacteriophage. Bacteriophages in our mucus act as a line of defense against bacteria that try to enter our bodies through our mouths and nose. A bacteriophage injects its DNA into an invading bacteria and then replicates itself many times over inside the bacteria. Then all these new baby bacteriophages burst out of the bacteria in a spectacular act of bactericide. Something I’ve thought for years is that we’re hurting ourselves by living in cities, staying indoors, not interacting with farm animals, sanitizing everything, swimming in chlorinated pools, washing our hands too often and with anti-bacterial soaps, taking too many baths, being overly-cautious about refrigerating food, etc. We're robbing ourselves of the good bacteria that once colonized us. As a result, we have more allergies, more inflammatory diseases, etc. Of course, I say this, but I can’t stand for my hands to be dirty. But I do notice a huge difference moving to the city and spending more time indoors than outdoors in the woods. Last time I went back to visit relatives who live in the pine-filled South, I was sneezing at pine pollen that never bothered me before. I’ve been trying to spend more time in the woods, even going so far as to fall into mud puddles while trail running. It’s all part of the master plan of gaining more microbes. At least I’ll tell myself that. When we take antibiotics, we know that we’re eliminating helpful bacteria as well as the bad bacteria infecting us. As a result, we’ve been led to believe that eating yogurt or probiotics can help restore our gut microbiome. And we've heard about our gut microbiome affecting obesity. It is true that several studies have shown that it appears that gut bacteria can determine our propensity toward obesity. For example, normal-sized mice have 3000 times more Akkermansia muciniphila than obese mice. When obese mice eat this bacteria, they lose weight and are less likely to have type 2 diabetes. However, studies have shown that eating yogurt doesn’t really change the gut biome in the long term and probiotics really can only shorten diarrhea brought about by the infection or the antibiotics. Probiotics an also save premature infants from death by necrotising entercolitis. Otherwise, neither yogurt nor probiotics do much good in restoring what we’ve lost. However, it is possible to restore our gut health by acquiring the right microbes. But the way that we do this may sound a little gross because it’s by cacophagy (ingesting feces in pill form) or fecal transplants. I noticed my dog doing this for herself on a walk the other day and had to tell myself that it wasn't gross; she was just treating herself to a free ecosystem transplant. Fecal transplant studies have been found to cure up to 94% of participants of certain maladies which is statistically amazing. Fecal transplants have been used to treat everything from obesity to gut issues to mental health issues. I feel like I need to reread this book a few times to really get everything from it. There are just so many things that are interesting in the world of microbes. I know this book only scratches the surface, but it does so in a way that’s easily readable and understandable. Sometimes when I was reading this, I found myself far more intrigued to see where a study went than to find out what was happening next in my fiction book. Not all authors of scientific subjects can manage to do that."
200,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I picked this book up recently from Audible (because they had a sale and I'm weak.) ((After writing that I remembered that as part of that sale I received a $5 credit and then went to Audible to scope out their daily deal to see if I wanted to use it on that. I. AM. WEAK.)) (((By the way, it's Leviathan Wakes, which I already own, and absolutely recommend. $5.95 - can't beat that price for the audio!))) But anyway, I've been reading and listening to a LOT of nonfiction this year, and this was right up my alley, so of course I would pick it up if it was on sale. And man, was this fascinating. I have never been the type of person who worries overmuch about cleanliness to the point of sterility, and this book has kind of made me feel justified in that. I learned a lot - some that worries me for the future of my preemie, c-section born, and formula-fed nephew's future gut health (because he didn't get a boost of beneficial microbes that vaginally born and breastfed babies usually get from their mothers)... but a lot more that makes me hopeful for a lot of other conditions and illnesses and diseases that could be treated or prevented with the right microbial application. The hubs and I have been probiotic fans for a while (him more religiously than I) and so it was a little disappointing to learn that for the most part, this is useless and bunk because any microbes ingested this way don't actually stick around to become part of our biome, but rather pass through as any other food would. But it is a thought in the right direction for how we think about health, and how we think about microbes. Far from the ""all bacteria are bad!"" model, we should be thinking about them as organisms that can be beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. To a mouse, a cat is always bad news. To a human relying on that cat to rid them of mice, the cat is beneficial. Sometimes we're the mouse, and sometimes we're the human, but the cat is always just the cat. I was really interested to learn how microbes have facilitated evolution and development for many, many animals through symbiosis. This part of the book was very fascinating to me, because we usually tend to think of an organism as suited to its environment on its own, but that isn't always the case. For some animals, the right microbe at the right time is necessary to reach maturity, or to be able to eat and digest certain foods, etc. Really interesting. I didn't love the reader for this audiobook. He wasn't bad, but he would pause oddly in the middle of sentences sometimes (especially toward the end of the book) and it would throw me off thinking that he was done with the sentence, only to continue the thought. Otherwise, the only little nitpick I had was that sometimes the way he pronounced things threw me off. Aside from that, I thought he did a fine job, and I really enjoyed the book."
201,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"A Most Engrossing Exploration of the Microbial Organisms Which Lurk Within UsEchoing Charles Darwin's concluding paragraph in the first edition of Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" in its subtitle, noted science journalist Ed Yong's ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life"" is an exceptional, quite riveting, account explaining how bacteria and other microbes have played - and continue to play - important roles in shaping the course of the history of life on our planet. Yong offers us a compelling account of microbial ecology - especially the human microbiome - that can be seen as a worthy successor to David Quammen's masterful book on biogeography, ""The Song of The Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction"", Quammen's other notable works on evolutionary biology and Carl Zimmer's excellent books ranging from microbiology to evolutionary biology. While Yong does not explicitly refer to the coevolution of bacteria and other microbes within their plant and animal hosts, he does stress the importance of the mutualistic aspects of coevolution, noting as the main theme of his book, symbiosis between microbes and those other, much larger, organisms for which they are the ""multitudes"" within them.Yong takes readers on a compelling journey through space and time, noting some of the most important figures in the history of microbiology as well as introducing us to important contemporary microbiologists, and especially, microbial ecologists, such as University of Texas, Austin entomologist Nancy A. Moran, who is highly regarded for her research into the coevolution of aphids with their microbiomes, and most recently, honeybees with theirs. There are also especially noteworthy biographical overviews of Antony van Leeuwenhoek, the inventor of the microscope, and the first serious scientific investigator of the microbial world, Carl Woese, the American microbiologist who discovered the Archaea, Earth's oldest - and most ""primitive"" - organisms, and Lynn Margulies, the maverick American biologist who developed the credible scientific theory of endosymbiosis, explaining the origin of the eukaryotic cell found in plants and animals. He also explains how the once popular germ theory of disease promoted first by the likes of Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur in the 19th Century - which treated virtually all microbes as germs that had to be destroyed to prevent humanity from suffering from germ-borne diseases - is giving way to a far more nuanced view of the microbes residing within us, as willing partners and occasionally, antagonists, which have played notable roles in our evolutionary histories while we have also been influencing theirs across the vast gulf of time.Yong asks us to see ourselves as individual ""islands"", drawing upon the scientific metaphor of island biogeography popularized by David Quammen in his seminal book, ""The Song of the Dodo"" and the subject of much notable ecological research from the 1960s to the present. We are ""islands"" inhabited by microbial denizens. He emphasizes this repeatedly, introducing us to species as bizarre as a squid that relies on luminous bacteria for fostering its growth from juvenile larvae to adult, and parthenogenetic female parasitic wasps relying on microbes that prevent the occurrence of reproductively fertile male wasps. He shows how important microbes are in facilitating digestion of otherwise inedible food, like grasses in the stomachs of ruminant mammals such as cows, goats and sheep. In humans, he notes how differing modes of birth - natural vaginal versus Caesarean section - will leave newborn infants with different microbiomes, that may have an important impact on the health of new-born infants. He also shows how current microbiome research in evolutionary medicine and environmental science, represents some of the newest frontiers in contemporary medicine and science.Ed Yong is such a compellingly gifted storyteller and prose stylist that ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life"" will simultaneously surprise, delight, and entertain its readers. There is never a dull moment lurking in the pages of Yong's book; instead, readers will be mesmerized from its opening pages to its very last. If Charles Darwin read Ed Yong's ""I Contain Multitudes"", he might conclude that it offers readers a much grander view of life than what he envisioned when he wrote ""On the Origin of Species"". He might admit to possessing after reading it, both a substantial understanding and appreciation for the microbial life that he never thought of when he ended ""On the Origin of Species"" with these eloquent observations; ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved."""
202,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"I Contain Multitudes  is an enjoyable and informative book that takes a look at how microbes live, where microbes live and their interactions with other species, including humans. This book contains many interesting scientific findings and microbial interactions - such as worms that don't have a mouth and don't need to eat; parasitic wasps with antibiotic antennae goo; viruses inside bacteria inside a bug; bacteria that influence which bugs get to breed; the effects of your microbial ecosystem in sickness and in health; as well as a whole lot of other fascinating stuff.The author has a personable writing style without turning into a semi-biography. He manages to explain scientific concepts without simplifying them too much or bogging the reader down with technical terminology. The beginning of the book is a bit disjointed in terms of story telling, but then gets better as the author goes along. I do wish Ed Yong had included more details about some of the topics discussed, but that was probably out of the scope for a popular science book like this.Other Recommended Books about Microbes:- March of the Microbes: Sighting the Unseen by John L.

203,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343721-becky,5,"This was cruising along at a pleasant 4 stars, but I had to bump it up when I got to the penultimate chapter. Here, the microbiomania was tempered by words of caution and foresight. For example, the lack of evidence that the lactic acid-producing bacteria survive the digestive track or even influence resident gut microbe communities, (most “probiotics” are mostly hype) while the bugs that HAVE shown clinical effects (e.g. in mice) should be wielded with much caution given that they are precisely more likely to establish themselves, and no organisms have only good or only bad effects. Even my favorite example of fecal transplants has really only been the miracle cure with C. diff infections, while the more complex IBD, obesity, and autism effects are clearly much more poorly understood. Still, there are amazing things on the horizon, and I love seeing that the actual reasearchers in the field are demonstrating that they have (finally) learned lessons from evolution and ecology and are trying to work with, rather than against, these forces. Balanced and rational arguments are so damned sexy."

The definition of microbiome and what bacteria are to us humans was extremely fascinating. I was following the book with the audio version; it really does read like someone talking to you about interesting little creatures that make us up as well as our entire world! The writing was awesome, very easy to read for those who are not into microbiology or animals. It’s definitely not a boring read, and I learned a lot from it. The research that went into this about how long ago is very evident, which makes the more that much more interesting to read. Bacteria is everywhere; however, it’s important to learn what they do and how to do it to appreciate the world around us."

It felt like a lot work to read without sufficient payoff. I feel more knowledgable about science and biology than the average person but I always felt a little behind in the science throughout. There were clearly interesting parts but they were outweighed by a writing and organizational style that felt unstructured and wandering. Very heavy on animal microbiomes, not as much on humans as I had hoped.

Turns out humans aren’t the independent, rugged, top of the food chain, go-it-alone heros of the universe after all!

So overall I enjoyed reading it.The reason for only three stars: the books structure is not great. He talks about an issue and revisits it again and again. It is lacking the flow, and feels like he is visiting the same points over and over again. I assume this is due to him writing a first lengthy book on a single subject. The narrative wanders a bit, and it is harder to follow from time to time.Also, some of the research presented in the book is preliminary and not conclusive. Even though he has a section on how we cannot infer cause-effect relationship of these findings, many instances of the book has premature conclusions.Overall, it was a fun to read book and taught me many new things. I recommend it, but do not expect this to be the ""best science book"" you'll read.I am sure with his talent and good storytelling skills he will get there, but this one is not it."

I also think what a great pity it is that the hospital I work in was designed with windows that are sealed shut, locking all of those pathogenic bacteria that we want to avoid inside with our patients. Think about that the next time you go to the hospital. "

218,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"Reading a straight pop-science book is a nice change, and even better when the book covers super-interesting material, as Ed Yong’s I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life does. Where Yong lays bare research into inter-species cooperation that’s changing scientist’s views about natural selection. In the classic evolutionary/ biological view, it’s “us” against “the world.” Life is a struggle, red in tooth and claw. While that is true, it ignores that adaptive success that cooperation often provides. But unlike macro-cooperation (like a tight-knit African village banding together to raise all of their children collectively, or Microsoft and Intel working together to benefit both companies), Yong focuses on microbiological cooperation. You know. Those “probiotics” yogurt and supplement companies are so keen to foist on us, overstating the potential benefits of eating Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Which, as Yong points out, seldom if ever survive our stomach acids. But Yong digs deeper than shallow pop-cultural gee whiz. For instance, he introduces a theory that a positive “bacterial infection” may have led to human’s increased brain-size. He finds the evidence in probiotics present in human infants, passed to the via their mothers, that increase brain size. What’s more, they break down chemicals in breast milk that neither our guts nor other probiotics can. He also discusses the bacterial adaptations of termites, and how bacteria, molds and algae band together to create a healthy environment for corals, which create a lush habitat for a healthy reef’s assorted flora and fauna.And then I Contain Multitudes delves deeper, highlighting the ecological collapse of the tight webs of interconnected lives. He traces many biological disturbances, from dying coral reefs to human bacterial infection, to “dysbiosis,” an imbalance of the ecological order. Sometimes this imbalance provides a new, more adaptive order, like how recovery from an illness protects us from that bug via antibodies. At other times, like in a dying coral reef or Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a dysbiosis can settle into a chilling, almost dead stasis.On a related, if and gross side-note that appeals to my inner 14-year-old science-geek (for the record, that’s many decades behind me), Yong spends a chapter discussing Fecal Microbiota Transplants. It’s as potty-humor funny as it sounds. Here, doctors (or alternative medicine quacks) shoot a slurry of healthy people’s poop into sick people’s rectums via a high-pressure enema. Though silly and gross-sounding, this procedure often cures dysbiotic ailments, such as Crohn’s Disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, albeit with risks. [FYI from my Inner Adult: Since there are risks, it's best to avoid alternative medical woo-woo and consult an MD for Fecal Matter Transplants. Which, despite the potty humor, is no laughing matter. Here’s a WebMD article that oulines the risk/ reward using the best available science: http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disord... ]My main criticism of the book is the gee-whiz visionaries and entrepreneurs, hoping to cash-in “using the science or probiotics” to create healthier human cityscapes and dwellings. Since scientific efforts like this have a storied history of failure. Like the kudzu that’s overtaking the southeast, which the Soil Erosion Service paid farmers to plant in fallow fields to avoid the next Dust Bowl, only to have it “take off,” overtaking about 2,500 acres of land in the south each year. Or the FDA introducing carp, a delicacy in European cuisines, as a source of farm income, only to discover that American-raised carp taste muddy compared to those raised in Europe. Problem was, byt the time they'd discovered this, carp eggs were “in the wild,” spreading like a plague, displacing native fish populations and destroying the habitat of others. These two failures of ""scientific solutions"" are illustrative: many more exist. So needless to say, this skeptic won’t hold his breath. Like the antibiotic craze that’s created or current dysbiosis and given rise to higher-than-average allergies, asthmas and other autoimmune diseases, this “cure” will likely create a new dysbiosis. Flaws (and new-fangled tech gee-whiz) aside, I enjoyed Ed Yong’s I Contain Multitudes. I recommend it without reservation to fans of science books. The material is engaging, new and interesting. And very important. I was tempted to give it five stars, but something held me back. So I’m going with my four-star (and probiotic rich) gut in saying “four-stars.” . "
219,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"The first paragraph of the book's description perfectly describes it for me. Yong didn't just tell me how important my microbiome is, by the end of book, I felt it. There he really missed a perfect picture for me - that of Pigpen from the Peanuts strip by Charles Shultz. We aren't discrete beings making our lonely way through the world, but continually changing clouds of bacteria influencing & being influenced by our surroundings plant, animal, & mineral due to our incredible ecologies. That's not an overstatement & Yong gives plenty of examples throughout the book.We didn't evolve in a vacuum, bacteria have constantly drenched every living organism. Most don't have much to do with us, but many find a home within the newcomers, the more complex hosts, & they act like good house guests. Sometimes they move in to stay & provide services (symbiot). Occasionally they get out of line (disbiosis) & far more rarely they're bad. He gives fascinating examples of all states.He really shined with his descriptions of how one variety mosquitoes are altered to not carry disease. I've heard about such efforts, but never knew any of the methods. He'd mentioned & had given enough details about the bacterial strain Wolbachia that when he got around to telling how scientists were infecting mosquitoes that carried Dengue fever with it in an attempt to eradicate the disease, it made perfect sense & I'm not a scientist of any sort. IOW, his explanations were all good & accessible.His discussion of balances within the microbiotic community were especially interesting to me since both my wife & daughter have stomach issues. I had no idea how much or quickly such things could change. A mere change in diet of a day can completely change the balance of our gut bacteria while a course of antibiotics can be catastrophic. Of course, we have to balance the risks of destroying gut bacteria against dying of another infection that the antibiotic is being taken for. Often there isn't a definite or even a good answer, but a guess based on probabilities. It's messy & defies simplification so beware of miracle cures. In a few decades a doctor might be able to tailor a bacterial cocktail for your particular symptoms & biome, but the science is in its infancy. One of the places it is starting is with Fecal Matter Transfer (FMT). Gross, but it's been routinely carried out for those whose systems are in such distress that they're losing weight & wearing diapers. A colonoscopy that plants a donor's poop up their own intestines often fixes the problem, at least for a time. Now they're refining this to cultures that are contained in a capsule. yes, they give out a poo pill! Apparently our species' aversion to eating poo isn't exactly the norm in the animal kingdom. Rabbits & rats have to eat their own or else they get a vitamin deficiency. Other species regularly eat other's poo & it's one way beneficial bacteria spread & inoculate them. It can also lead to similar smells among them fostering a sense of community. Who knew? Fascinating!I was really surprised by the example of Sea World keeping the dolphin's water too clean. Anyone who has had an aquarium knows it takes a while to balance the system & clear up the water. It's not dirt, but the bio-balance, so it's often best to start a new tank by taking water from an existing aquarium. I never changed more than 1/3 of the water per week, a rule of thumb that was told to me early on by seemingly everyone. Ivory tower syndrome?While this is rather long & sagged a bit about 2/3-3/4 of the way through (at least I wandered a bit) I highly recommend reading it all the way through. The end is great & well worth the journey. My edition was well narrated & easily understood. I did get the ebook to refer to, but didn't have to very often - mostly just for the name & spelling of some terms & names.Highly recommended!"
220,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna,5,"This was a fascinating book. I’ve heard of gut microbiota and faecal microbiome transfer, but there was tons of new information. One of the most important concepts for me was that the microbiome is necessary for the normal development and functioning of higher organisms. One of the main targets for research is the gut:“The weird biology of germ-free animals is most obvious in the gut. A well-functioning gut needs a big surface area for absorbing nutrients, which is why its walls are densely lined with long, finger-like pillars. It needs to constantly regenerate the cells at its surface, which get sloughed off by the passing tide of food. It needs a rich network of underlying blood vessels to carry nutrients to and fro. And it needs to be sealed – its cells must stick tightly to each other to prevent foreign molecules (and microbes) from leaking into those blood vessels. All of these essential properties are compromised without microbes.If zebrafish or mice grow up in the absence of bacteria their guts don’t develop fully, (which) can be rectified simply by giving the animals a normal complement of microbes or even isolated microbial molecules. The bacteria don’t physically reshape the gut themselves. Instead, they work via their hosts...Lora Hooper demonstrated this by infusing into germ-free mice a common gut bacterium called Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron – or B-theta to its friends. She found that the microbe activated a wide range of mouse genes that are involved in absorbing nutrients, building an impermeable barrier, breaking down toxins, creating blood vessels, and creating mature cells.”The microbiome is also essential in the early development and the normal functioning of the mature immune system:… an animal’s genome doesn’t provide everything it needs to create a mature immune system. It also needs input from a microbiome. Hundreds of scientific papers, on species as diverse as mice, tsetse flies and zebrafish, have shown that microbes help to shape the immune system in some way. They influence the creation of entire classes of immune cells, and the development of organs that make and store those cells. They are especially important early in life, when the immunity machine is first constructed and tunes itself to the big, bad world. And once the machine is chugging away, microbes continue to calibrate its reactions to threats.I found it fascinating that breast milk doesn’t just contain antibodies to protect the infant, it also contains special oligosaccharides: „scientists have identified over 200 human milk oligosaccharides, or HMOs, so far” that the infant can’t digest. Breast-fed infants carry Bifidobacteria in their guts. “HMOs are not an all-purpose food for Bifs. [] the sugars selectively nourish one particular subspecies called Bifidobacterium longum infantis, or B. infantis for short. As long as you provide it with HMOs, it will outcompete any other gut bacterium.” [] As it digests HMOs, B. infantis releases short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that feed an infant’s gut cells – so while mothers nourish this microbe, the microbe in turn nourishes the baby. Through direct contact, B. infantis also encourages gut cells to make adhesive proteins that seal the gaps between them, and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system.”There are also chapters dealing with how microbes play a role in the life and death of coral reefs, symbionts in insects, how symbiosis is a precarious balance and only advantageous when the microbes are in the right place at the right time… I could go on, but you must read it yourself. I think it will be an engrossing read for anyone who is interested in science, symbiosis, evolution, ecology, hygiene…"

Ed Yong is a science journalist and an amazing story teller. He masters the difficult art of delivering detailed and scientifically accurate information in an agreeable way, without scaring away the layman reader while satisfying someone with knowledge in the field as well. In fact, he manages to make it so interesting that I often found myself glued to the pages and sometimes reading parts of the text aloud to my daughters.Yong’s erudition is visible in many ways, including the several links he makes with literature, which begin right with the title of the book, a verse taken from a poem by Walt Whitman, ”Song to myself”.In the introduction, Yong describes a visit to a zoo with a microbiologist, to collect samples from a white-bellied pangolin – in his words, “an utterly endearing animal that looks like a cross between an anteater and a pine cone.” What starts like a novel, quickly gives way to an overview of the different types of microbes that live on, within and around every animal. We find ourselves amazed by the variety and ubiquity of these beings and we know we’re trapped: our curiosity has been stirred and we will not stop reading this book!The first chapter of the book is a summary of the evolution of life on Earth, framing the appearance of the human being in relation to other life forms, and especially single-cell ones:“All the visible organisms we’re familiar with, everything that springs to mind when we think of ‘nature’, are latecomers to life’s story. For most of the tale, microbes were the only living things on Earth” (more precisely, from March to October, in an imaginary calendar that we can use if we collapse the planet’s entire 4.54 billion years old history into one year, to make it manageable by our brains; in this calendar, humans have only existed for the last 30 min of December 31).The second chapter is a condensed historical overview of the “discovery” of microbes by man and the way knowledge and our general perception of this group has evolved. It finishes with a visit to a museum in the Netherlands dedicated to microscopic life, that I absolutely need to visit: Micropia (https://www.micropia.nl/en/)From here onwards, each chapter follows the work and the recent discoveries of scientists working in different parts of the world with different microbe groups and applications (ecology, agriculture, human health…). I am not making a summary or giving away any spoilers, but suffice to say that although I am not a complete layman in this field, I still found myself amazed and fascinated enough to ponder enrolling on a microbiology online course just to freshen up my long forgotten and outdated knowledge in this field.As far as I could find out, this was Ed Yong’s first book. I can’t wait to read his next one, although I am prepared to wait, as I am sure books like these take a very long time to write. This is very clear from the dozens of people he interviewed, laboratories he visited and publications he consulted. The book has around 70 pages of notes and bibliography, which I found myself constantly referring to.For those who are still thinking whether they should read this book, I am leaving a link to a talk given by Ed Yong himself about his book on the day it was published. I am sure he will convince you himself:https://edyong.me/i-contain-multitudes/"

223,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,5,"The fun thing about participating in readathons, is that books that have been on my TBR pile get a chance to float to the top. I read this as part of the May #AsianReadathon, and listened to the audiobook which is well narrated by Charlie Anson.I loved biology as a kid, and was that kid who read every single book she could get her hands on. So much so, that my Mom, a Bio and Chemistry teacher, had to keep them away from me so I would study other subjects. This wonderful book took me back to those days of sheer delight and wonderment at learning such cool stuff.This nonfiction book is wide reaching in scope, but takes deep dives on specific themes. Homo Sapiens often forget that we are relatively really late to this game called life, and that microbes have been around (and dominant) for much, much, much longer. It should then not be a surprise that all other life forms evolved with/around microbes. It's not news today that we are all covered (internally and externally) with trillions of microbes, but it's not often that we look at the world from the microbes point of view. This book explores the history, zoology, ecology, and biology of microbes and how they affect every single living thing on the planet in a myriad of ways. We often tend to focus on the bad guys - the pathogens - but that's like learning about terrorists, and assuming all that kind of people are terrorists. Not remotely true. I was educated, entertained, entranced, my mental maps where changed, and I will never look the world the same again. It was rather like a flat lander learning that the planet is not in fact flat. I do not exaggerate. The writing is really good, and covers a lot of ground in an easily digestible manner without dumbing things down. I appreciated the author's respect for the people on the front lines of the field, and the humor interspersed throughout. I loved every minute. I just learned the author covers science for The Atlantic, and I've added all his articles to my TBR list.Why might you care about microbes you ask? Well, from the book blurb: Many people think of microbes as germs to be eradicated, but those that live with us—the microbiome—build our bodies, protect our health, shape our identities, and grant us incredible abilities. You choose to remain ignorant at your own peril!"
224,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21413858-k-j-charles,0,"Very interesting overview of how microbes work for and against us, and some of the developments in expanding technology. Also gives a good argument for not trying to create hygenic, sterile, too-clean environments because they reduce our microbe populations and leave us vulnerable to invasion by bad things. As a slob, I feel vindicated. Highly readable, the best sort of popular science."
225,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,4,"This was an interesting book about the microbes inside us and around us and that are everywhere. This book goes into a lot of detail about the symbiosis between the microbes and other organisms, humans and animals. They are essential for life in all aspects, in digestion, our immune systems, and every other aspect of life. We would not be here today without them. It is also important to know that most microbes are not harmful. We have become so fixated on getting rid of them by too many antibiotics and too much antibacterial soaps and overly hygienic conditions that it is to our detriment. Antibiotics must be taken with care and only when necessary. Bacteria have been around forever and we have learned about them since Louis Pasteur and other microbiologists but with the new technologies of gene sequencing and genomics, it is now possible to sequence every gene and get a complete detail of every microbiome. With our understanding of evolution, we know that all life has co-evolved within close contact with microbes. And with our fast expanding knowledge of these microbes, we are learning how to eradicate diseases and learn how to live with them symbiotically.This book covers a very interesting array of topics about microbes in an understandable way and is for you if you are interested in microbiology."

227,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This is an absolutely fantastic journey into the world of microbes. A world that pre-existed the one of all more complicated life forms and that every other creature has had to accommodate to.I’m on day five of influenza and am sorely not up to writing the titillating review this book deserves. I am hoping my virus infection does not result in a bacterial infection that would need antibiotics. Bacteria evolve at a blistering speed by gene transfer, so resistance is almost instantaneous. Furthermore, a dose of antibiotics would put my gut microbes into havoc, possibly decimating the colonies I would like to keep and let more nasty ones settle. But no, you cannot treat a viral infection itself with antibiotics! Please! Our microbiomes aren’t inherently good or bad. There is no such thing as a good bug or a bad bug. Some play along the entire scale anyway. What has become clear is that our obsession with cleanliness is counterproductive, causing autoimmune diseases such as asthma. We need to train our immune systems to not be jittery and overreact.This book deserves to be read. It’s well told and entertaining, while being immensely informative."
228,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,4,"If you’re a physician, a nutritionist, or have studied biology, you’re probably aware that our bodies contain an immense number of microbes. Most of the rest of us find that surprising. Though I knew about the bugs that inhabit my digestive system, British science journalist Ed Yong helped me understand just how numerous and widely dispersed those microbes are on my body—and yours. Try 39 trillion. That number’s greater than the estimated number of human cells in our bodies. And it’s 100 times as great as the largest estimate of the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. In other words, it’s an understatement to say that the number of microbes we contain is astronomical.Should we fear the microbes within us?Now, before you panic about the many diseases you’ll contract from all these bugs, rest assured. “There are fewer than 100 species of bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans,” as Yong explains in I Contain Multitudes. “By contrast, the thousands of species in our guts are mostly harmless.” And a great many of them play indispensable roles in keeping us alive and disease-free. They bolster our immune system, digest our food, and even help make us who we are.How did this come about? “Remember that animals emerged in a world that had already been teeming with microbes for billions of years,” Yong notes. “They were the rulers of the planet long before we arrived. And when we did arrive, of course we evolved ways of interacting with the microbes around us.”The world within usThe collection of microbes in each of us is generally called the microbiome. Yong explains its functions and its fathomless diversity in conversational English with occasional flashes of humor. “Every one of us is a zoo in our own right,” he writes. “A colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collective. An entire world. . . Some species are common, but none is everywhere.” And that collection of species is unique to each of us. The microbes in my gut and on my skin are very different from those in and on you. Not only that but “your right hand shares just a sixth of its microbial species with your left hand.”The symbiosis spectrumThe theme of I Contain Multitudes is symbiosis. In common parlance, symbiosis suggests mutual benefit. Technically, though, the meaning is broader. “If one partner benefited at the expense of the other, it was a parasite (or a pathogen if it caused disease). If it benefited without affecting its host, it was a commensal. If it benefited its host, it was a mutualist. All these styles of coexistence fell under the rubric of symbiosis.” Yong’s book includes a huge number of examples, not just within our own bodies but in animals and plants as well. If you have an affinity for science, you’ll love this book.By the way, “there is no such thing as a ‘good microbe’ or a ‘bad microbe’ . . . In reality, bacteria exist along a continuum of lifestyles, between ‘bad’ parasites and ‘good’ mutualists. Some microbes . . . slide from one end of the parasite-mutualist spectrum to the other, depending on the strain, and on the host they find themselves in.” The possibilities of these combinations are endless.The ever-evolving field of biologyYong will take you on a tour of the laboratories where scientists study symbiosis and its effects on its many hosts in other living things. You’ll meet the pioneers in the field—a fascinating lot, few of whom match the stereotype of the frizzy-haired, absent-minded professor. You’ll learn about the emerging fields of biogeography, metagenomics, and synthetic biology. And you’ll see how the discoveries in these fields are benefiting medical science—and portend more advances in the future.The title of this engrossing book is from Walt Whitman: “I am large. I contain multitudes.”About the authorBorn Edmund Soon-Weng Yong in 1981, Ed Yong is a staff member of The Atlantic. He has degrees in zoology and biochemistry from England’s most celebrated centers of scientific teaching and research, the University of Cambridge and University College London. His popular blog has been incorporated into the National Geographic online."
229,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/563794-amy,5,"I originally encountered this book when ordering it for a class at the high school where I work. I have to think that if I had read this book in high school, my life would have taken a different trajectory. I find the world of bacteria and fungi to be ridiculously fascinating. Since I started reading this book, I’ve started reading microbiology textbooks and even joined a local mycology society. I’m not sure what I can do with all of this fascination at this point in my life, but here I am. I made 102 highlights in this book. Where in the world do I start? First of all, I think it’s important to clear up the misconception microbes are mainly disease-causing germs. Viruses cause diseases, but fewer than 100 bacteria actually cause diseases. So many of them work in symbiosis with the creatures that they inhabit making them healthier overall. Many have evolved with their hosts. Some of the more interesting ones discussed in the book are microbes that work inside insects to do things that the insects couldn't do on their own (such as the protozoa inside termites which help to digest wood). I could read an entire book on microbes inside insects and be happy. One of the more intriguing microbes that works in our favor is the bacteriophage. Bacteriophages in our mucus act as a line of defense against bacteria that try to enter our bodies through our mouths and nose. A bacteriophage injects its DNA into an invading bacteria and then replicates itself many times over inside the bacteria. Then all these new baby bacteriophages burst out of the bacteria in a spectacular act of bactericide. Something I’ve thought for years is that we’re hurting ourselves by living in cities, staying indoors, not interacting with farm animals, sanitizing everything, swimming in chlorinated pools, washing our hands too often and with anti-bacterial soaps, taking too many baths, being overly-cautious about refrigerating food, etc. We're robbing ourselves of the good bacteria that once colonized us. As a result, we have more allergies, more inflammatory diseases, etc. Of course, I say this, but I can’t stand for my hands to be dirty. But I do notice a huge difference moving to the city and spending more time indoors than outdoors in the woods. Last time I went back to visit relatives who live in the pine-filled South, I was sneezing at pine pollen that never bothered me before. I’ve been trying to spend more time in the woods, even going so far as to fall into mud puddles while trail running. It’s all part of the master plan of gaining more microbes. At least I’ll tell myself that. When we take antibiotics, we know that we’re eliminating helpful bacteria as well as the bad bacteria infecting us. As a result, we’ve been led to believe that eating yogurt or probiotics can help restore our gut microbiome. And we've heard about our gut microbiome affecting obesity. It is true that several studies have shown that it appears that gut bacteria can determine our propensity toward obesity. For example, normal-sized mice have 3000 times more Akkermansia muciniphila than obese mice. When obese mice eat this bacteria, they lose weight and are less likely to have type 2 diabetes. However, studies have shown that eating yogurt doesn’t really change the gut biome in the long term and probiotics really can only shorten diarrhea brought about by the infection or the antibiotics. Probiotics an also save premature infants from death by necrotising entercolitis. Otherwise, neither yogurt nor probiotics do much good in restoring what we’ve lost. However, it is possible to restore our gut health by acquiring the right microbes. But the way that we do this may sound a little gross because it’s by cacophagy (ingesting feces in pill form) or fecal transplants. I noticed my dog doing this for herself on a walk the other day and had to tell myself that it wasn't gross; she was just treating herself to a free ecosystem transplant. Fecal transplant studies have been found to cure up to 94% of participants of certain maladies which is statistically amazing. Fecal transplants have been used to treat everything from obesity to gut issues to mental health issues. I feel like I need to reread this book a few times to really get everything from it. There are just so many things that are interesting in the world of microbes. I know this book only scratches the surface, but it does so in a way that’s easily readable and understandable. Sometimes when I was reading this, I found myself far more intrigued to see where a study went than to find out what was happening next in my fiction book. Not all authors of scientific subjects can manage to do that."
230,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I picked this book up recently from Audible (because they had a sale and I'm weak.) ((After writing that I remembered that as part of that sale I received a $5 credit and then went to Audible to scope out their daily deal to see if I wanted to use it on that. I. AM. WEAK.)) (((By the way, it's Leviathan Wakes, which I already own, and absolutely recommend. $5.95 - can't beat that price for the audio!))) But anyway, I've been reading and listening to a LOT of nonfiction this year, and this was right up my alley, so of course I would pick it up if it was on sale. And man, was this fascinating. I have never been the type of person who worries overmuch about cleanliness to the point of sterility, and this book has kind of made me feel justified in that. I learned a lot - some that worries me for the future of my preemie, c-section born, and formula-fed nephew's future gut health (because he didn't get a boost of beneficial microbes that vaginally born and breastfed babies usually get from their mothers)... but a lot more that makes me hopeful for a lot of other conditions and illnesses and diseases that could be treated or prevented with the right microbial application. The hubs and I have been probiotic fans for a while (him more religiously than I) and so it was a little disappointing to learn that for the most part, this is useless and bunk because any microbes ingested this way don't actually stick around to become part of our biome, but rather pass through as any other food would. But it is a thought in the right direction for how we think about health, and how we think about microbes. Far from the ""all bacteria are bad!"" model, we should be thinking about them as organisms that can be beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. To a mouse, a cat is always bad news. To a human relying on that cat to rid them of mice, the cat is beneficial. Sometimes we're the mouse, and sometimes we're the human, but the cat is always just the cat. I was really interested to learn how microbes have facilitated evolution and development for many, many animals through symbiosis. This part of the book was very fascinating to me, because we usually tend to think of an organism as suited to its environment on its own, but that isn't always the case. For some animals, the right microbe at the right time is necessary to reach maturity, or to be able to eat and digest certain foods, etc. Really interesting. I didn't love the reader for this audiobook. He wasn't bad, but he would pause oddly in the middle of sentences sometimes (especially toward the end of the book) and it would throw me off thinking that he was done with the sentence, only to continue the thought. Otherwise, the only little nitpick I had was that sometimes the way he pronounced things threw me off. Aside from that, I thought he did a fine job, and I really enjoyed the book."
231,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"A Most Engrossing Exploration of the Microbial Organisms Which Lurk Within UsEchoing Charles Darwin's concluding paragraph in the first edition of Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" in its subtitle, noted science journalist Ed Yong's ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life"" is an exceptional, quite riveting, account explaining how bacteria and other microbes have played - and continue to play - important roles in shaping the course of the history of life on our planet. Yong offers us a compelling account of microbial ecology - especially the human microbiome - that can be seen as a worthy successor to David Quammen's masterful book on biogeography, ""The Song of The Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction"", Quammen's other notable works on evolutionary biology and Carl Zimmer's excellent books ranging from microbiology to evolutionary biology. While Yong does not explicitly refer to the coevolution of bacteria and other microbes within their plant and animal hosts, he does stress the importance of the mutualistic aspects of coevolution, noting as the main theme of his book, symbiosis between microbes and those other, much larger, organisms for which they are the ""multitudes"" within them.Yong takes readers on a compelling journey through space and time, noting some of the most important figures in the history of microbiology as well as introducing us to important contemporary microbiologists, and especially, microbial ecologists, such as University of Texas, Austin entomologist Nancy A. Moran, who is highly regarded for her research into the coevolution of aphids with their microbiomes, and most recently, honeybees with theirs. There are also especially noteworthy biographical overviews of Antony van Leeuwenhoek, the inventor of the microscope, and the first serious scientific investigator of the microbial world, Carl Woese, the American microbiologist who discovered the Archaea, Earth's oldest - and most ""primitive"" - organisms, and Lynn Margulies, the maverick American biologist who developed the credible scientific theory of endosymbiosis, explaining the origin of the eukaryotic cell found in plants and animals. He also explains how the once popular germ theory of disease promoted first by the likes of Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur in the 19th Century - which treated virtually all microbes as germs that had to be destroyed to prevent humanity from suffering from germ-borne diseases - is giving way to a far more nuanced view of the microbes residing within us, as willing partners and occasionally, antagonists, which have played notable roles in our evolutionary histories while we have also been influencing theirs across the vast gulf of time.Yong asks us to see ourselves as individual ""islands"", drawing upon the scientific metaphor of island biogeography popularized by David Quammen in his seminal book, ""The Song of the Dodo"" and the subject of much notable ecological research from the 1960s to the present. We are ""islands"" inhabited by microbial denizens. He emphasizes this repeatedly, introducing us to species as bizarre as a squid that relies on luminous bacteria for fostering its growth from juvenile larvae to adult, and parthenogenetic female parasitic wasps relying on microbes that prevent the occurrence of reproductively fertile male wasps. He shows how important microbes are in facilitating digestion of otherwise inedible food, like grasses in the stomachs of ruminant mammals such as cows, goats and sheep. In humans, he notes how differing modes of birth - natural vaginal versus Caesarean section - will leave newborn infants with different microbiomes, that may have an important impact on the health of new-born infants. He also shows how current microbiome research in evolutionary medicine and environmental science, represents some of the newest frontiers in contemporary medicine and science.Ed Yong is such a compellingly gifted storyteller and prose stylist that ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life"" will simultaneously surprise, delight, and entertain its readers. There is never a dull moment lurking in the pages of Yong's book; instead, readers will be mesmerized from its opening pages to its very last. If Charles Darwin read Ed Yong's ""I Contain Multitudes"", he might conclude that it offers readers a much grander view of life than what he envisioned when he wrote ""On the Origin of Species"". He might admit to possessing after reading it, both a substantial understanding and appreciation for the microbial life that he never thought of when he ended ""On the Origin of Species"" with these eloquent observations; ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved."""
232,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"I Contain Multitudes  is an enjoyable and informative book that takes a look at how microbes live, where microbes live and their interactions with other species, including humans. This book contains many interesting scientific findings and microbial interactions - such as worms that don't have a mouth and don't need to eat; parasitic wasps with antibiotic antennae goo; viruses inside bacteria inside a bug; bacteria that influence which bugs get to breed; the effects of your microbial ecosystem in sickness and in health; as well as a whole lot of other fascinating stuff.The author has a personable writing style without turning into a semi-biography. He manages to explain scientific concepts without simplifying them too much or bogging the reader down with technical terminology. The beginning of the book is a bit disjointed in terms of story telling, but then gets better as the author goes along. I do wish Ed Yong had included more details about some of the topics discussed, but that was probably out of the scope for a popular science book like this.Other Recommended Books about Microbes:- March of the Microbes: Sighting the Unseen by John L.

233,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343721-becky,5,"This was cruising along at a pleasant 4 stars, but I had to bump it up when I got to the penultimate chapter. Here, the microbiomania was tempered by words of caution and foresight. For example, the lack of evidence that the lactic acid-producing bacteria survive the digestive track or even influence resident gut microbe communities, (most “probiotics” are mostly hype) while the bugs that HAVE shown clinical effects (e.g. in mice) should be wielded with much caution given that they are precisely more likely to establish themselves, and no organisms have only good or only bad effects. Even my favorite example of fecal transplants has really only been the miracle cure with C. diff infections, while the more complex IBD, obesity, and autism effects are clearly much more poorly understood. Still, there are amazing things on the horizon, and I love seeing that the actual reasearchers in the field are demonstrating that they have (finally) learned lessons from evolution and ecology and are trying to work with, rather than against, these forces. Balanced and rational arguments are so damned sexy."

It felt like a lot work to read without sufficient payoff. I feel more knowledgable about science and biology than the average person but I always felt a little behind in the science throughout. There were clearly interesting parts but they were outweighed by a writing and organizational style that felt unstructured and wandering. Very heavy on animal microbiomes, not as much on humans as I had hoped. If you're not interested in committing 264 pages of your life to this, you can get was amounts to a best-of on his ""Fresh Air"" interview. "

Turns out humans aren’t the independent, rugged, top of the food chain, go-it-alone heros of the universe after all! Instead, our very lives, and health—even our moods and thoughts, are interconnected with microbes and viruses in ways we’ve only begun to comprehend. A prismatic glimpse into the web of life. Highly recommended."
240,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27456036-barbara,4,This book contains so much information one would need to reread and reread it and still not absorb it all. The history of microbe studies as well as very current research is fascinating. Ed Long does a great job using analogies to help the lay reader understand the complexities. Those interested in science and specifically microbes will enjoy this book.

So overall I enjoyed reading it.The reason for only three stars: the books structure is not great. He talks about an issue and revisits it again and again. It is lacking the flow, and feels like he is visiting the same points over and over again. I assume this is due to him writing a first lengthy book on a single subject. The narrative wanders a bit, and it is harder to follow from time to time.Also, some of the research presented in the book is preliminary and not conclusive. Even though he has a section on how we cannot infer cause-effect relationship of these findings, many instances of the book has premature conclusions.Overall, it was a fun to read book and taught me many new things. I recommend it, but do not expect this to be the ""best science book"" you'll read.I am sure with his talent and good storytelling skills he will get there, but this one is not it."

The population of Canada is (marginally) less than that. I can’t help but picture Pigpen from Charlie Brown walking around with his cloud of dirt. I also think what a great pity it is that the hospital I work in was designed with windows that are sealed shut, locking all of those pathogenic bacteria that we want to avoid inside with our patients. Think about that the next time you go to the hospital. "

248,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"Reading a straight pop-science book is a nice change, and even better when the book covers super-interesting material, as Ed Yong’s I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life does. Where Yong lays bare research into inter-species cooperation that’s changing scientist’s views about natural selection. In the classic evolutionary/ biological view, it’s “us” against “the world.” Life is a struggle, red in tooth and claw. While that is true, it ignores that adaptive success that cooperation often provides. But unlike macro-cooperation (like a tight-knit African village banding together to raise all of their children collectively, or Microsoft and Intel working together to benefit both companies), Yong focuses on microbiological cooperation. You know. Those “probiotics” yogurt and supplement companies are so keen to foist on us, overstating the potential benefits of eating Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Which, as Yong points out, seldom if ever survive our stomach acids. But Yong digs deeper than shallow pop-cultural gee whiz. For instance, he introduces a theory that a positive “bacterial infection” may have led to human’s increased brain-size. He finds the evidence in probiotics present in human infants, passed to the via their mothers, that increase brain size. What’s more, they break down chemicals in breast milk that neither our guts nor other probiotics can. He also discusses the bacterial adaptations of termites, and how bacteria, molds and algae band together to create a healthy environment for corals, which create a lush habitat for a healthy reef’s assorted flora and fauna.And then I Contain Multitudes delves deeper, highlighting the ecological collapse of the tight webs of interconnected lives. He traces many biological disturbances, from dying coral reefs to human bacterial infection, to “dysbiosis,” an imbalance of the ecological order. Sometimes this imbalance provides a new, more adaptive order, like how recovery from an illness protects us from that bug via antibodies. At other times, like in a dying coral reef or Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a dysbiosis can settle into a chilling, almost dead stasis.On a related, if and gross side-note that appeals to my inner 14-year-old science-geek (for the record, that’s many decades behind me), Yong spends a chapter discussing Fecal Microbiota Transplants. It’s as potty-humor funny as it sounds. Here, doctors (or alternative medicine quacks) shoot a slurry of healthy people’s poop into sick people’s rectums via a high-pressure enema. Though silly and gross-sounding, this procedure often cures dysbiotic ailments, such as Crohn’s Disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, albeit with risks. [FYI from my Inner Adult: Since there are risks, it's best to avoid alternative medical woo-woo and consult an MD for Fecal Matter Transplants. Which, despite the potty humor, is no laughing matter. Here’s a WebMD article that oulines the risk/ reward using the best available science: http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disord... ]My main criticism of the book is the gee-whiz visionaries and entrepreneurs, hoping to cash-in “using the science or probiotics” to create healthier human cityscapes and dwellings. Since scientific efforts like this have a storied history of failure. Like the kudzu that’s overtaking the southeast, which the Soil Erosion Service paid farmers to plant in fallow fields to avoid the next Dust Bowl, only to have it “take off,” overtaking about 2,500 acres of land in the south each year. Or the FDA introducing carp, a delicacy in European cuisines, as a source of farm income, only to discover that American-raised carp taste muddy compared to those raised in Europe. Problem was, byt the time they'd discovered this, carp eggs were “in the wild,” spreading like a plague, displacing native fish populations and destroying the habitat of others. These two failures of ""scientific solutions"" are illustrative: many more exist. So needless to say, this skeptic won’t hold his breath. Like the antibiotic craze that’s created or current dysbiosis and given rise to higher-than-average allergies, asthmas and other autoimmune diseases, this “cure” will likely create a new dysbiosis. Flaws (and new-fangled tech gee-whiz) aside, I enjoyed Ed Yong’s I Contain Multitudes. I recommend it without reservation to fans of science books. The material is engaging, new and interesting. And very important. I was tempted to give it five stars, but something held me back. So I’m going with my four-star (and probiotic rich) gut in saying “four-stars.” . "
249,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"The first paragraph of the book's description perfectly describes it for me. Yong didn't just tell me how important my microbiome is, by the end of book, I felt it. There he really missed a perfect picture for me - that of Pigpen from the Peanuts strip by Charles Shultz. We aren't discrete beings making our lonely way through the world, but continually changing clouds of bacteria influencing & being influenced by our surroundings plant, animal, & mineral due to our incredible ecologies. That's not an overstatement & Yong gives plenty of examples throughout the book.We didn't evolve in a vacuum, bacteria have constantly drenched every living organism. Most don't have much to do with us, but many find a home within the newcomers, the more complex hosts, & they act like good house guests. Sometimes they move in to stay & provide services (symbiot). Occasionally they get out of line (disbiosis) & far more rarely they're bad. He gives fascinating examples of all states.He really shined with his descriptions of how one variety mosquitoes are altered to not carry disease. I've heard about such efforts, but never knew any of the methods. He'd mentioned & had given enough details about the bacterial strain Wolbachia that when he got around to telling how scientists were infecting mosquitoes that carried Dengue fever with it in an attempt to eradicate the disease, it made perfect sense & I'm not a scientist of any sort. IOW, his explanations were all good & accessible.His discussion of balances within the microbiotic community were especially interesting to me since both my wife & daughter have stomach issues. I had no idea how much or quickly such things could change. A mere change in diet of a day can completely change the balance of our gut bacteria while a course of antibiotics can be catastrophic. Of course, we have to balance the risks of destroying gut bacteria against dying of another infection that the antibiotic is being taken for. Often there isn't a definite or even a good answer, but a guess based on probabilities. It's messy & defies simplification so beware of miracle cures. In a few decades a doctor might be able to tailor a bacterial cocktail for your particular symptoms & biome, but the science is in its infancy. One of the places it is starting is with Fecal Matter Transfer (FMT). Gross, but it's been routinely carried out for those whose systems are in such distress that they're losing weight & wearing diapers. A colonoscopy that plants a donor's poop up their own intestines often fixes the problem, at least for a time. Now they're refining this to cultures that are contained in a capsule. yes, they give out a poo pill! Apparently our species' aversion to eating poo isn't exactly the norm in the animal kingdom. Rabbits & rats have to eat their own or else they get a vitamin deficiency. Other species regularly eat other's poo & it's one way beneficial bacteria spread & inoculate them. It can also lead to similar smells among them fostering a sense of community. Who knew? Fascinating!I was really surprised by the example of Sea World keeping the dolphin's water too clean. Anyone who has had an aquarium knows it takes a while to balance the system & clear up the water. It's not dirt, but the bio-balance, so it's often best to start a new tank by taking water from an existing aquarium. I never changed more than 1/3 of the water per week, a rule of thumb that was told to me early on by seemingly everyone. Ivory tower syndrome?While this is rather long & sagged a bit about 2/3-3/4 of the way through (at least I wandered a bit) I highly recommend reading it all the way through. The end is great & well worth the journey. My edition was well narrated & easily understood. I did get the ebook to refer to, but didn't have to very often - mostly just for the name & spelling of some terms & names.Highly recommended!"
250,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna,5,"This was a fascinating book. I’ve heard of gut microbiota and faecal microbiome transfer, but there was tons of new information. One of the most important concepts for me was that the microbiome is necessary for the normal development and functioning of higher organisms. One of the main targets for research is the gut:“The weird biology of germ-free animals is most obvious in the gut. A well-functioning gut needs a big surface area for absorbing nutrients, which is why its walls are densely lined with long, finger-like pillars. It needs to constantly regenerate the cells at its surface, which get sloughed off by the passing tide of food. It needs a rich network of underlying blood vessels to carry nutrients to and fro. And it needs to be sealed – its cells must stick tightly to each other to prevent foreign molecules (and microbes) from leaking into those blood vessels. All of these essential properties are compromised without microbes.If zebrafish or mice grow up in the absence of bacteria their guts don’t develop fully, (which) can be rectified simply by giving the animals a normal complement of microbes or even isolated microbial molecules. The bacteria don’t physically reshape the gut themselves. Instead, they work via their hosts...Lora Hooper demonstrated this by infusing into germ-free mice a common gut bacterium called Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron – or B-theta to its friends. She found that the microbe activated a wide range of mouse genes that are involved in absorbing nutrients, building an impermeable barrier, breaking down toxins, creating blood vessels, and creating mature cells.”The microbiome is also essential in the early development and the normal functioning of the mature immune system:… an animal’s genome doesn’t provide everything it needs to create a mature immune system. It also needs input from a microbiome. Hundreds of scientific papers, on species as diverse as mice, tsetse flies and zebrafish, have shown that microbes help to shape the immune system in some way. They influence the creation of entire classes of immune cells, and the development of organs that make and store those cells. They are especially important early in life, when the immunity machine is first constructed and tunes itself to the big, bad world. And once the machine is chugging away, microbes continue to calibrate its reactions to threats.I found it fascinating that breast milk doesn’t just contain antibodies to protect the infant, it also contains special oligosaccharides: „scientists have identified over 200 human milk oligosaccharides, or HMOs, so far” that the infant can’t digest. Breast-fed infants carry Bifidobacteria in their guts. “HMOs are not an all-purpose food for Bifs. [] the sugars selectively nourish one particular subspecies called Bifidobacterium longum infantis, or B. infantis for short. As long as you provide it with HMOs, it will outcompete any other gut bacterium.” [] As it digests HMOs, B. infantis releases short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that feed an infant’s gut cells – so while mothers nourish this microbe, the microbe in turn nourishes the baby. Through direct contact, B. infantis also encourages gut cells to make adhesive proteins that seal the gaps between them, and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system.”There are also chapters dealing with how microbes play a role in the life and death of coral reefs, symbionts in insects, how symbiosis is a precarious balance and only advantageous when the microbes are in the right place at the right time… I could go on, but you must read it yourself. I think it will be an engrossing read for anyone who is interested in science, symbiosis, evolution, ecology, hygiene…"
251,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1192324-ana,5,"This will be a difficult book to review, because I find myself short of words to express how good it is! Ed Yong is a science journalist and an amazing story teller. He masters the difficult art of delivering detailed and scientifically accurate information in an agreeable way, without scaring away the layman reader while satisfying someone with knowledge in the field as well. In fact, he manages to make it so interesting that I often found myself glued to the pages and sometimes reading parts of the text aloud to my daughters.Yong’s erudition is visible in many ways, including the several links he makes with literature, which begin right with the title of the book, a verse taken from a poem by Walt Whitman, ”Song to myself”.In the introduction, Yong describes a visit to a zoo with a microbiologist, to collect samples from a white-bellied pangolin – in his words, “an utterly endearing animal that looks like a cross between an anteater and a pine cone.” What starts like a novel, quickly gives way to an overview of the different types of microbes that live on, within and around every animal. We find ourselves amazed by the variety and ubiquity of these beings and we know we’re trapped: our curiosity has been stirred and we will not stop reading this book!The first chapter of the book is a summary of the evolution of life on Earth, framing the appearance of the human being in relation to other life forms, and especially single-cell ones:“All the visible organisms we’re familiar with, everything that springs to mind when we think of ‘nature’, are latecomers to life’s story. For most of the tale, microbes were the only living things on Earth” (more precisely, from March to October, in an imaginary calendar that we can use if we collapse the planet’s entire 4.54 billion years old history into one year, to make it manageable by our brains; in this calendar, humans have only existed for the last 30 min of December 31).The second chapter is a condensed historical overview of the “discovery” of microbes by man and the way knowledge and our general perception of this group has evolved. It finishes with a visit to a museum in the Netherlands dedicated to microscopic life, that I absolutely need to visit: Micropia (https://www.micropia.nl/en/)From here onwards, each chapter follows the work and the recent discoveries of scientists working in different parts of the world with different microbe groups and applications (ecology, agriculture, human health…). I am not making a summary or giving away any spoilers, but suffice to say that although I am not a complete layman in this field, I still found myself amazed and fascinated enough to ponder enrolling on a microbiology online course just to freshen up my long forgotten and outdated knowledge in this field.As far as I could find out, this was Ed Yong’s first book. I can’t wait to read his next one, although I am prepared to wait, as I am sure books like these take a very long time to write. This is very clear from the dozens of people he interviewed, laboratories he visited and publications he consulted. The book has around 70 pages of notes and bibliography, which I found myself constantly referring to.For those who are still thinking whether they should read this book, I am leaving a link to a talk given by Ed Yong himself about his book on the day it was published. I am sure he will convince you himself:https://edyong.me/i-contain-multitudes/"

I read this as part of the May #AsianReadathon, and listened to the audiobook which is well narrated by Charlie Anson.I loved biology as a kid, and was that kid who read every single book she could get her hands on. So much so, that my Mom, a Bio and Chemistry teacher, had to keep them away from me so I would study other subjects. This wonderful book took me back to those days of sheer delight and wonderment at learning such cool stuff.This nonfiction book is wide reaching in scope, but takes deep dives on specific themes. Homo Sapiens often forget that we are relatively really late to this game called life, and that microbes have been around (and dominant) for much, much, much longer. It should then not be a surprise that all other life forms evolved with/around microbes. It's not news today that we are all covered (internally and externally) with trillions of microbes, but it's not often that we look at the world from the microbes point of view. This book explores the history, zoology, ecology, and biology of microbes and how they affect every single living thing on the planet in a myriad of ways. We often tend to focus on the bad guys - the pathogens - but that's like learning about terrorists, and assuming all that kind of people are terrorists. Not remotely true. I was educated, entertained, entranced, my mental maps where changed, and I will never look the world the same again. It was rather like a flat lander learning that the planet is not in fact flat. I do not exaggerate. The writing is really good, and covers a lot of ground in an easily digestible manner without dumbing things down. I appreciated the author's respect for the people on the front lines of the field, and the humor interspersed throughout. I loved every minute. I just learned the author covers science for The Atlantic, and I've added all his articles to my TBR list.Why might you care about microbes you ask? Well, from the book blurb: Many people think of microbes as germs to be eradicated, but those that live with us—the microbiome—build our bodies, protect our health, shape our identities, and grant us incredible abilities. You choose to remain ignorant at your own peril!"

This book goes into a lot of detail about the symbiosis between the microbes and other organisms, humans and animals. They are essential for life in all aspects, in digestion, our immune systems, and every other aspect of life. We would not be here today without them. It is also important to know that most microbes are not harmful. We have become so fixated on getting rid of them by too many antibiotics and too much antibacterial soaps and overly hygienic conditions that it is to our detriment. Antibiotics must be taken with care and only when necessary. Bacteria have been around forever and we have learned about them since Louis Pasteur and other microbiologists but with the new technologies of gene sequencing and genomics, it is now possible to sequence every gene and get a complete detail of every microbiome. With our understanding of evolution, we know that all life has co-evolved within close contact with microbes. And with our fast expanding knowledge of these microbes, we are learning how to eradicate diseases and learn how to live with them symbiotically.This book covers a very interesting array of topics about microbes in an understandable way and is for you if you are interested in microbiology."

A world that pre-existed the one of all more complicated life forms and that every other creature has had to accommodate to.I’m on day five of influenza and am sorely not up to writing the titillating review this book deserves. I am hoping my virus infection does not result in a bacterial infection that would need antibiotics. Bacteria evolve at a blistering speed by gene transfer, so resistance is almost instantaneous. Furthermore, a dose of antibiotics would put my gut microbes into havoc, possibly decimating the colonies I would like to keep and let more nasty ones settle. But no, you cannot treat a viral infection itself with antibiotics! Please! Our microbiomes aren’t inherently good or bad. There is no such thing as a good bug or a bad bug. Some play along the entire scale anyway. What has become clear is that our obsession with cleanliness is counterproductive, causing autoimmune diseases such as asthma. We need to train our immune systems to not be jittery and overreact.This book deserves to be read. It’s well told and entertaining, while being immensely informative."
258,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,4,"If you’re a physician, a nutritionist, or have studied biology, you’re probably aware that our bodies contain an immense number of microbes. Most of the rest of us find that surprising. Though I knew about the bugs that inhabit my digestive system, British science journalist Ed Yong helped me understand just how numerous and widely dispersed those microbes are on my body—and yours. Try 39 trillion. That number’s greater than the estimated number of human cells in our bodies. And it’s 100 times as great as the largest estimate of the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. In other words, it’s an understatement to say that the number of microbes we contain is astronomical.Should we fear the microbes within us?Now, before you panic about the many diseases you’ll contract from all these bugs, rest assured. “There are fewer than 100 species of bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans,” as Yong explains in I Contain Multitudes. “By contrast, the thousands of species in our guts are mostly harmless.” And a great many of them play indispensable roles in keeping us alive and disease-free. They bolster our immune system, digest our food, and even help make us who we are.How did this come about? “Remember that animals emerged in a world that had already been teeming with microbes for billions of years,” Yong notes. “They were the rulers of the planet long before we arrived. And when we did arrive, of course we evolved ways of interacting with the microbes around us.”The world within usThe collection of microbes in each of us is generally called the microbiome. Yong explains its functions and its fathomless diversity in conversational English with occasional flashes of humor. “Every one of us is a zoo in our own right,” he writes. “A colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collective. An entire world. . . Some species are common, but none is everywhere.” And that collection of species is unique to each of us. The microbes in my gut and on my skin are very different from those in and on you. Not only that but “your right hand shares just a sixth of its microbial species with your left hand.”The symbiosis spectrumThe theme of I Contain Multitudes is symbiosis. In common parlance, symbiosis suggests mutual benefit. Technically, though, the meaning is broader. “If one partner benefited at the expense of the other, it was a parasite (or a pathogen if it caused disease). If it benefited without affecting its host, it was a commensal. If it benefited its host, it was a mutualist. All these styles of coexistence fell under the rubric of symbiosis.” Yong’s book includes a huge number of examples, not just within our own bodies but in animals and plants as well. If you have an affinity for science, you’ll love this book.By the way, “there is no such thing as a ‘good microbe’ or a ‘bad microbe’ . . . In reality, bacteria exist along a continuum of lifestyles, between ‘bad’ parasites and ‘good’ mutualists. Some microbes . . . slide from one end of the parasite-mutualist spectrum to the other, depending on the strain, and on the host they find themselves in.” The possibilities of these combinations are endless.The ever-evolving field of biologyYong will take you on a tour of the laboratories where scientists study symbiosis and its effects on its many hosts in other living things. You’ll meet the pioneers in the field—a fascinating lot, few of whom match the stereotype of the frizzy-haired, absent-minded professor. You’ll learn about the emerging fields of biogeography, metagenomics, and synthetic biology. And you’ll see how the discoveries in these fields are benefiting medical science—and portend more advances in the future.The title of this engrossing book is from Walt Whitman: “I am large. I contain multitudes.”About the authorBorn Edmund Soon-Weng Yong in 1981, Ed Yong is a staff member of The Atlantic. He has degrees in zoology and biochemistry from England’s most celebrated centers of scientific teaching and research, the University of Cambridge and University College London. His popular blog has been incorporated into the National Geographic online."
259,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/563794-amy,5,"I originally encountered this book when ordering it for a class at the high school where I work. I have to think that if I had read this book in high school, my life would have taken a different trajectory. I find the world of bacteria and fungi to be ridiculously fascinating. Since I started reading this book, I’ve started reading microbiology textbooks and even joined a local mycology society. I’m not sure what I can do with all of this fascination at this point in my life, but here I am. I made 102 highlights in this book. Where in the world do I start? First of all, I think it’s important to clear up the misconception microbes are mainly disease-causing germs. Viruses cause diseases, but fewer than 100 bacteria actually cause diseases. So many of them work in symbiosis with the creatures that they inhabit making them healthier overall. Many have evolved with their hosts. Some of the more interesting ones discussed in the book are microbes that work inside insects to do things that the insects couldn't do on their own (such as the protozoa inside termites which help to digest wood). I could read an entire book on microbes inside insects and be happy. One of the more intriguing microbes that works in our favor is the bacteriophage. Bacteriophages in our mucus act as a line of defense against bacteria that try to enter our bodies through our mouths and nose. A bacteriophage injects its DNA into an invading bacteria and then replicates itself many times over inside the bacteria. Then all these new baby bacteriophages burst out of the bacteria in a spectacular act of bactericide. Something I’ve thought for years is that we’re hurting ourselves by living in cities, staying indoors, not interacting with farm animals, sanitizing everything, swimming in chlorinated pools, washing our hands too often and with anti-bacterial soaps, taking too many baths, being overly-cautious about refrigerating food, etc. We're robbing ourselves of the good bacteria that once colonized us. As a result, we have more allergies, more inflammatory diseases, etc. Of course, I say this, but I can’t stand for my hands to be dirty. But I do notice a huge difference moving to the city and spending more time indoors than outdoors in the woods. Last time I went back to visit relatives who live in the pine-filled South, I was sneezing at pine pollen that never bothered me before. I’ve been trying to spend more time in the woods, even going so far as to fall into mud puddles while trail running. It’s all part of the master plan of gaining more microbes. At least I’ll tell myself that. When we take antibiotics, we know that we’re eliminating helpful bacteria as well as the bad bacteria infecting us. As a result, we’ve been led to believe that eating yogurt or probiotics can help restore our gut microbiome. And we've heard about our gut microbiome affecting obesity. It is true that several studies have shown that it appears that gut bacteria can determine our propensity toward obesity. For example, normal-sized mice have 3000 times more Akkermansia muciniphila than obese mice. When obese mice eat this bacteria, they lose weight and are less likely to have type 2 diabetes. However, studies have shown that eating yogurt doesn’t really change the gut biome in the long term and probiotics really can only shorten diarrhea brought about by the infection or the antibiotics. Probiotics an also save premature infants from death by necrotising entercolitis. Otherwise, neither yogurt nor probiotics do much good in restoring what we’ve lost. However, it is possible to restore our gut health by acquiring the right microbes. But the way that we do this may sound a little gross because it’s by cacophagy (ingesting feces in pill form) or fecal transplants. I noticed my dog doing this for herself on a walk the other day and had to tell myself that it wasn't gross; she was just treating herself to a free ecosystem transplant. Fecal transplant studies have been found to cure up to 94% of participants of certain maladies which is statistically amazing. Fecal transplants have been used to treat everything from obesity to gut issues to mental health issues. I feel like I need to reread this book a few times to really get everything from it. There are just so many things that are interesting in the world of microbes. I know this book only scratches the surface, but it does so in a way that’s easily readable and understandable. Sometimes when I was reading this, I found myself far more intrigued to see where a study went than to find out what was happening next in my fiction book. Not all authors of scientific subjects can manage to do that."
260,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I picked this book up recently from Audible (because they had a sale and I'm weak.) ((After writing that I remembered that as part of that sale I received a $5 credit and then went to Audible to scope out their daily deal to see if I wanted to use it on that. I. AM. WEAK.)) (((By the way, it's Leviathan Wakes, which I already own, and absolutely recommend. $5.95 - can't beat that price for the audio!))) But anyway, I've been reading and listening to a LOT of nonfiction this year, and this was right up my alley, so of course I would pick it up if it was on sale. And man, was this fascinating. I have never been the type of person who worries overmuch about cleanliness to the point of sterility, and this book has kind of made me feel justified in that. I learned a lot - some that worries me for the future of my preemie, c-section born, and formula-fed nephew's future gut health (because he didn't get a boost of beneficial microbes that vaginally born and breastfed babies usually get from their mothers)... but a lot more that makes me hopeful for a lot of other conditions and illnesses and diseases that could be treated or prevented with the right microbial application. The hubs and I have been probiotic fans for a while (him more religiously than I) and so it was a little disappointing to learn that for the most part, this is useless and bunk because any microbes ingested this way don't actually stick around to become part of our biome, but rather pass through as any other food would. But it is a thought in the right direction for how we think about health, and how we think about microbes. Far from the ""all bacteria are bad!"" model, we should be thinking about them as organisms that can be beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. To a mouse, a cat is always bad news. To a human relying on that cat to rid them of mice, the cat is beneficial. Sometimes we're the mouse, and sometimes we're the human, but the cat is always just the cat. I was really interested to learn how microbes have facilitated evolution and development for many, many animals through symbiosis. This part of the book was very fascinating to me, because we usually tend to think of an organism as suited to its environment on its own, but that isn't always the case. For some animals, the right microbe at the right time is necessary to reach maturity, or to be able to eat and digest certain foods, etc. Really interesting. I didn't love the reader for this audiobook. He wasn't bad, but he would pause oddly in the middle of sentences sometimes (especially toward the end of the book) and it would throw me off thinking that he was done with the sentence, only to continue the thought. Otherwise, the only little nitpick I had was that sometimes the way he pronounced things threw me off. Aside from that, I thought he did a fine job, and I really enjoyed the book."
261,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"A Most Engrossing Exploration of the Microbial Organisms Which Lurk Within UsEchoing Charles Darwin's concluding paragraph in the first edition of Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" in its subtitle, noted science journalist Ed Yong's ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life"" is an exceptional, quite riveting, account explaining how bacteria and other microbes have played - and continue to play - important roles in shaping the course of the history of life on our planet. Yong offers us a compelling account of microbial ecology - especially the human microbiome - that can be seen as a worthy successor to David Quammen's masterful book on biogeography, ""The Song of The Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction"", Quammen's other notable works on evolutionary biology and Carl Zimmer's excellent books ranging from microbiology to evolutionary biology. While Yong does not explicitly refer to the coevolution of bacteria and other microbes within their plant and animal hosts, he does stress the importance of the mutualistic aspects of coevolution, noting as the main theme of his book, symbiosis between microbes and those other, much larger, organisms for which they are the ""multitudes"" within them.Yong takes readers on a compelling journey through space and time, noting some of the most important figures in the history of microbiology as well as introducing us to important contemporary microbiologists, and especially, microbial ecologists, such as University of Texas, Austin entomologist Nancy A. Moran, who is highly regarded for her research into the coevolution of aphids with their microbiomes, and most recently, honeybees with theirs. There are also especially noteworthy biographical overviews of Antony van Leeuwenhoek, the inventor of the microscope, and the first serious scientific investigator of the microbial world, Carl Woese, the American microbiologist who discovered the Archaea, Earth's oldest - and most ""primitive"" - organisms, and Lynn Margulies, the maverick American biologist who developed the credible scientific theory of endosymbiosis, explaining the origin of the eukaryotic cell found in plants and animals. He also explains how the once popular germ theory of disease promoted first by the likes of Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur in the 19th Century - which treated virtually all microbes as germs that had to be destroyed to prevent humanity from suffering from germ-borne diseases - is giving way to a far more nuanced view of the microbes residing within us, as willing partners and occasionally, antagonists, which have played notable roles in our evolutionary histories while we have also been influencing theirs across the vast gulf of time.Yong asks us to see ourselves as individual ""islands"", drawing upon the scientific metaphor of island biogeography popularized by David Quammen in his seminal book, ""The Song of the Dodo"" and the subject of much notable ecological research from the 1960s to the present. We are ""islands"" inhabited by microbial denizens. He emphasizes this repeatedly, introducing us to species as bizarre as a squid that relies on luminous bacteria for fostering its growth from juvenile larvae to adult, and parthenogenetic female parasitic wasps relying on microbes that prevent the occurrence of reproductively fertile male wasps. He shows how important microbes are in facilitating digestion of otherwise inedible food, like grasses in the stomachs of ruminant mammals such as cows, goats and sheep. In humans, he notes how differing modes of birth - natural vaginal versus Caesarean section - will leave newborn infants with different microbiomes, that may have an important impact on the health of new-born infants. He also shows how current microbiome research in evolutionary medicine and environmental science, represents some of the newest frontiers in contemporary medicine and science.Ed Yong is such a compellingly gifted storyteller and prose stylist that ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life"" will simultaneously surprise, delight, and entertain its readers. There is never a dull moment lurking in the pages of Yong's book; instead, readers will be mesmerized from its opening pages to its very last. If Charles Darwin read Ed Yong's ""I Contain Multitudes"", he might conclude that it offers readers a much grander view of life than what he envisioned when he wrote ""On the Origin of Species"". He might admit to possessing after reading it, both a substantial understanding and appreciation for the microbial life that he never thought of when he ended ""On the Origin of Species"" with these eloquent observations; ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved."""
262,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"I Contain Multitudes  is an enjoyable and informative book that takes a look at how microbes live, where microbes live and their interactions with other species, including humans. This book contains many interesting scientific findings and microbial interactions - such as worms that don't have a mouth and don't need to eat; parasitic wasps with antibiotic antennae goo; viruses inside bacteria inside a bug; bacteria that influence which bugs get to breed; the effects of your microbial ecosystem in sickness and in health; as well as a whole lot of other fascinating stuff.The author has a personable writing style without turning into a semi-biography. He manages to explain scientific concepts without simplifying them too much or bogging the reader down with technical terminology. The beginning of the book is a bit disjointed in terms of story telling, but then gets better as the author goes along. I do wish Ed Yong had included more details about some of the topics discussed, but that was probably out of the scope for a popular science book like this.Other Recommended Books about Microbes:- March of the Microbes: Sighting the Unseen by John L.

Here, the microbiomania was tempered by words of caution and foresight. For example, the lack of evidence that the lactic acid-producing bacteria survive the digestive track or even influence resident gut microbe communities, (most “probiotics” are mostly hype) while the bugs that HAVE shown clinical effects (e.g. in mice) should be wielded with much caution given that they are precisely more likely to establish themselves, and no organisms have only good or only bad effects. Even my favorite example of fecal transplants has really only been the miracle cure with C. diff infections, while the more complex IBD, obesity, and autism effects are clearly much more poorly understood. Still, there are amazing things on the horizon, and I love seeing that the actual reasearchers in the field are demonstrating that they have (finally) learned lessons from evolution and ecology and are trying to work with, rather than against, these forces. Balanced and rational arguments are so damned sexy."

I was following the book with the audio version; it really does read like someone talking to you about interesting little creatures that make us up as well as our entire world! The writing was awesome, very easy to read for those who are not into microbiology or animals. It’s definitely not a boring read, and I learned a lot from it. The research that went into this about how long ago is very evident, which makes the more that much more interesting to read.

It felt like a lot work to read without sufficient payoff. I feel more knowledgable about science and biology than the average person but I always felt a little behind in the science throughout. There were clearly interesting parts but they were outweighed by a writing and organizational style that felt unstructured and wandering.

So overall I enjoyed reading it.The reason for only three stars: the books structure is not great. He talks about an issue and revisits it again and again. It is lacking the flow, and feels like he is visiting the same points over and over again. I assume this is due to him writing a first lengthy book on a single subject. The narrative wanders a bit, and it is harder to follow from time to time.Also, some of the research presented in the book is preliminary and not conclusive. Even though he has a section on how we cannot infer cause-effect relationship of these findings, many instances of the book has premature conclusions.Overall, it was a fun to read book and taught me many new things. I recommend it, but do not expect this to be the ""best science book"" you'll read.I am sure with his talent and good storytelling skills he will get there, but this one is not it."

I also think what a great pity it is that the hospital I work in was designed with windows that are sealed shut, locking all of those pathogenic bacteria that we want to avoid inside with our patients. Think about that the next time you go to the hospital. "

278,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"Reading a straight pop-science book is a nice change, and even better when the book covers super-interesting material, as Ed Yong’s I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life does. Where Yong lays bare research into inter-species cooperation that’s changing scientist’s views about natural selection. In the classic evolutionary/ biological view, it’s “us” against “the world.” Life is a struggle, red in tooth and claw. While that is true, it ignores that adaptive success that cooperation often provides. But unlike macro-cooperation (like a tight-knit African village banding together to raise all of their children collectively, or Microsoft and Intel working together to benefit both companies), Yong focuses on microbiological cooperation. You know. Those “probiotics” yogurt and supplement companies are so keen to foist on us, overstating the potential benefits of eating Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Which, as Yong points out, seldom if ever survive our stomach acids. But Yong digs deeper than shallow pop-cultural gee whiz. For instance, he introduces a theory that a positive “bacterial infection” may have led to human’s increased brain-size. He finds the evidence in probiotics present in human infants, passed to the via their mothers, that increase brain size. What’s more, they break down chemicals in breast milk that neither our guts nor other probiotics can. He also discusses the bacterial adaptations of termites, and how bacteria, molds and algae band together to create a healthy environment for corals, which create a lush habitat for a healthy reef’s assorted flora and fauna.And then I Contain Multitudes delves deeper, highlighting the ecological collapse of the tight webs of interconnected lives. He traces many biological disturbances, from dying coral reefs to human bacterial infection, to “dysbiosis,” an imbalance of the ecological order. Sometimes this imbalance provides a new, more adaptive order, like how recovery from an illness protects us from that bug via antibodies. At other times, like in a dying coral reef or Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a dysbiosis can settle into a chilling, almost dead stasis.On a related, if and gross side-note that appeals to my inner 14-year-old science-geek (for the record, that’s many decades behind me), Yong spends a chapter discussing Fecal Microbiota Transplants. It’s as potty-humor funny as it sounds. Here, doctors (or alternative medicine quacks) shoot a slurry of healthy people’s poop into sick people’s rectums via a high-pressure enema. Though silly and gross-sounding, this procedure often cures dysbiotic ailments, such as Crohn’s Disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, albeit with risks. [FYI from my Inner Adult: Since there are risks, it's best to avoid alternative medical woo-woo and consult an MD for Fecal Matter Transplants. Which, despite the potty humor, is no laughing matter. Here’s a WebMD article that oulines the risk/ reward using the best available science: http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disord... ]My main criticism of the book is the gee-whiz visionaries and entrepreneurs, hoping to cash-in “using the science or probiotics” to create healthier human cityscapes and dwellings. Since scientific efforts like this have a storied history of failure. Like the kudzu that’s overtaking the southeast, which the Soil Erosion Service paid farmers to plant in fallow fields to avoid the next Dust Bowl, only to have it “take off,” overtaking about 2,500 acres of land in the south each year. Or the FDA introducing carp, a delicacy in European cuisines, as a source of farm income, only to discover that American-raised carp taste muddy compared to those raised in Europe. Problem was, byt the time they'd discovered this, carp eggs were “in the wild,” spreading like a plague, displacing native fish populations and destroying the habitat of others. These two failures of ""scientific solutions"" are illustrative: many more exist. So needless to say, this skeptic won’t hold his breath. Like the antibiotic craze that’s created or current dysbiosis and given rise to higher-than-average allergies, asthmas and other autoimmune diseases, this “cure” will likely create a new dysbiosis. Flaws (and new-fangled tech gee-whiz) aside, I enjoyed Ed Yong’s I Contain Multitudes. I recommend it without reservation to fans of science books. The material is engaging, new and interesting. And very important. I was tempted to give it five stars, but something held me back. So I’m going with my four-star (and probiotic rich) gut in saying “four-stars.” . "
279,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"The first paragraph of the book's description perfectly describes it for me. Yong didn't just tell me how important my microbiome is, by the end of book, I felt it. There he really missed a perfect picture for me - that of Pigpen from the Peanuts strip by Charles Shultz. We aren't discrete beings making our lonely way through the world, but continually changing clouds of bacteria influencing & being influenced by our surroundings plant, animal, & mineral due to our incredible ecologies. That's not an overstatement & Yong gives plenty of examples throughout the book.We didn't evolve in a vacuum, bacteria have constantly drenched every living organism. Most don't have much to do with us, but many find a home within the newcomers, the more complex hosts, & they act like good house guests. Sometimes they move in to stay & provide services (symbiot). Occasionally they get out of line (disbiosis) & far more rarely they're bad. He gives fascinating examples of all states.He really shined with his descriptions of how one variety mosquitoes are altered to not carry disease. I've heard about such efforts, but never knew any of the methods. He'd mentioned & had given enough details about the bacterial strain Wolbachia that when he got around to telling how scientists were infecting mosquitoes that carried Dengue fever with it in an attempt to eradicate the disease, it made perfect sense & I'm not a scientist of any sort. IOW, his explanations were all good & accessible.His discussion of balances within the microbiotic community were especially interesting to me since both my wife & daughter have stomach issues. I had no idea how much or quickly such things could change. A mere change in diet of a day can completely change the balance of our gut bacteria while a course of antibiotics can be catastrophic. Of course, we have to balance the risks of destroying gut bacteria against dying of another infection that the antibiotic is being taken for. Often there isn't a definite or even a good answer, but a guess based on probabilities. It's messy & defies simplification so beware of miracle cures. In a few decades a doctor might be able to tailor a bacterial cocktail for your particular symptoms & biome, but the science is in its infancy. One of the places it is starting is with Fecal Matter Transfer (FMT). Gross, but it's been routinely carried out for those whose systems are in such distress that they're losing weight & wearing diapers. A colonoscopy that plants a donor's poop up their own intestines often fixes the problem, at least for a time. Now they're refining this to cultures that are contained in a capsule. yes, they give out a poo pill! Apparently our species' aversion to eating poo isn't exactly the norm in the animal kingdom. Rabbits & rats have to eat their own or else they get a vitamin deficiency. Other species regularly eat other's poo & it's one way beneficial bacteria spread & inoculate them. It can also lead to similar smells among them fostering a sense of community. Who knew? Fascinating!I was really surprised by the example of Sea World keeping the dolphin's water too clean. Anyone who has had an aquarium knows it takes a while to balance the system & clear up the water. It's not dirt, but the bio-balance, so it's often best to start a new tank by taking water from an existing aquarium. I never changed more than 1/3 of the water per week, a rule of thumb that was told to me early on by seemingly everyone. Ivory tower syndrome?While this is rather long & sagged a bit about 2/3-3/4 of the way through (at least I wandered a bit) I highly recommend reading it all the way through. The end is great & well worth the journey. My edition was well narrated & easily understood. I did get the ebook to refer to, but didn't have to very often - mostly just for the name & spelling of some terms & names.Highly recommended!"
280,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna,5,"This was a fascinating book. I’ve heard of gut microbiota and faecal microbiome transfer, but there was tons of new information. One of the most important concepts for me was that the microbiome is necessary for the normal development and functioning of higher organisms. One of the main targets for research is the gut:“The weird biology of germ-free animals is most obvious in the gut. A well-functioning gut needs a big surface area for absorbing nutrients, which is why its walls are densely lined with long, finger-like pillars. It needs to constantly regenerate the cells at its surface, which get sloughed off by the passing tide of food. It needs a rich network of underlying blood vessels to carry nutrients to and fro. And it needs to be sealed – its cells must stick tightly to each other to prevent foreign molecules (and microbes) from leaking into those blood vessels. All of these essential properties are compromised without microbes.If zebrafish or mice grow up in the absence of bacteria their guts don’t develop fully, (which) can be rectified simply by giving the animals a normal complement of microbes or even isolated microbial molecules. The bacteria don’t physically reshape the gut themselves. Instead, they work via their hosts...Lora Hooper demonstrated this by infusing into germ-free mice a common gut bacterium called Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron – or B-theta to its friends. She found that the microbe activated a wide range of mouse genes that are involved in absorbing nutrients, building an impermeable barrier, breaking down toxins, creating blood vessels, and creating mature cells.”The microbiome is also essential in the early development and the normal functioning of the mature immune system:… an animal’s genome doesn’t provide everything it needs to create a mature immune system. It also needs input from a microbiome. Hundreds of scientific papers, on species as diverse as mice, tsetse flies and zebrafish, have shown that microbes help to shape the immune system in some way. They influence the creation of entire classes of immune cells, and the development of organs that make and store those cells. They are especially important early in life, when the immunity machine is first constructed and tunes itself to the big, bad world. And once the machine is chugging away, microbes continue to calibrate its reactions to threats.I found it fascinating that breast milk doesn’t just contain antibodies to protect the infant, it also contains special oligosaccharides: „scientists have identified over 200 human milk oligosaccharides, or HMOs, so far” that the infant can’t digest. Breast-fed infants carry Bifidobacteria in their guts. “HMOs are not an all-purpose food for Bifs. [] the sugars selectively nourish one particular subspecies called Bifidobacterium longum infantis, or B. infantis for short. As long as you provide it with HMOs, it will outcompete any other gut bacterium.” [] As it digests HMOs, B. infantis releases short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that feed an infant’s gut cells – so while mothers nourish this microbe, the microbe in turn nourishes the baby. Through direct contact, B. infantis also encourages gut cells to make adhesive proteins that seal the gaps between them, and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system.”There are also chapters dealing with how microbes play a role in the life and death of coral reefs, symbionts in insects, how symbiosis is a precarious balance and only advantageous when the microbes are in the right place at the right time… I could go on, but you must read it yourself. I think it will be an engrossing read for anyone who is interested in science, symbiosis, evolution, ecology, hygiene…"

In fact, he manages to make it so interesting that I often found myself glued to the pages and sometimes reading parts of the text aloud to my daughters.Yong’s erudition is visible in many ways, including the several links he makes with literature, which begin right with the title of the book, a verse taken from a poem by Walt Whitman, ”Song to myself”.In the introduction, Yong describes a visit to a zoo with a microbiologist, to collect samples from a white-bellied pangolin – in his words, “an utterly endearing animal that looks like a cross between an anteater and a pine cone.” What starts like a novel, quickly gives way to an overview of the different types of microbes that live on, within and around every animal. We find ourselves amazed by the variety and ubiquity of these beings and we know we’re trapped: our curiosity has been stirred and we will not stop reading this book!The first chapter of the book is a summary of the evolution of life on Earth, framing the appearance of the human being in relation to other life forms, and especially single-cell ones:“All the visible organisms we’re familiar with, everything that springs to mind when we think of ‘nature’, are latecomers to life’s story. For most of the tale, microbes were the only living things on Earth” (more precisely, from March to October, in an imaginary calendar that we can use if we collapse the planet’s entire 4.54 billion years old history into one year, to make it manageable by our brains; in this calendar, humans have only existed for the last 30 min of December 31).The second chapter is a condensed historical overview of the “discovery” of microbes by man and the way knowledge and our general perception of this group has evolved. It finishes with a visit to a museum in the Netherlands dedicated to microscopic life, that I absolutely need to visit: Micropia (https://www.micropia.nl/en/)From here onwards, each chapter follows the work and the recent discoveries of scientists working in different parts of the world with different microbe groups and applications (ecology, agriculture, human health…). I am not making a summary or giving away any spoilers, but suffice to say that although I am not a complete layman in this field, I still found myself amazed and fascinated enough to ponder enrolling on a microbiology online course just to freshen up my long forgotten and outdated knowledge in this field.As far as I could find out, this was Ed Yong’s first book. I can’t wait to read his next one, although I am prepared to wait, as I am sure books like these take a very long time to write. This is very clear from the dozens of people he interviewed, laboratories he visited and publications he consulted. The book has around 70 pages of notes and bibliography, which I found myself constantly referring to.For those who are still thinking whether they should read this book, I am leaving a link to a talk given by Ed Yong himself about his book on the day it was published. I am sure he will convince you himself:https://edyong.me/i-contain-multitudes/"

I read this as part of the May #AsianReadathon, and listened to the audiobook which is well narrated by Charlie Anson.I loved biology as a kid, and was that kid who read every single book she could get her hands on. So much so, that my Mom, a Bio and Chemistry teacher, had to keep them away from me so I would study other subjects. This wonderful book took me back to those days of sheer delight and wonderment at learning such cool stuff.This nonfiction book is wide reaching in scope, but takes deep dives on specific themes. Homo Sapiens often forget that we are relatively really late to this game called life, and that microbes have been around (and dominant) for much, much, much longer. It should then not be a surprise that all other life forms evolved with/around microbes. It's not news today that we are all covered (internally and externally) with trillions of microbes, but it's not often that we look at the world from the microbes point of view. This book explores the history, zoology, ecology, and biology of microbes and how they affect every single living thing on the planet in a myriad of ways. We often tend to focus on the bad guys - the pathogens - but that's like learning about terrorists, and assuming all that kind of people are terrorists. Not remotely true. I was educated, entertained, entranced, my mental maps where changed, and I will never look the world the same again. It was rather like a flat lander learning that the planet is not in fact flat. I do not exaggerate. The writing is really good, and covers a lot of ground in an easily digestible manner without dumbing things down. I appreciated the author's respect for the people on the front lines of the field, and the humor interspersed throughout. I loved every minute. I just learned the author covers science for The Atlantic, and I've added all his articles to my TBR list.Why might you care about microbes you ask? Well, from the book blurb: Many people think of microbes as germs to be eradicated, but those that live with us—the microbiome—build our bodies, protect our health, shape our identities, and grant us incredible abilities. You choose to remain ignorant at your own peril!"

Also gives a good argument for not trying to create hygenic, sterile, too-clean environments because they reduce our microbe populations and leave us vulnerable to invasion by bad things. As a slob, I feel vindicated. Highly readable, the best sort of popular science."
285,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,4,"This was an interesting book about the microbes inside us and around us and that are everywhere. This book goes into a lot of detail about the symbiosis between the microbes and other organisms, humans and animals. They are essential for life in all aspects, in digestion, our immune systems, and every other aspect of life. We would not be here today without them. It is also important to know that most microbes are not harmful. We have become so fixated on getting rid of them by too many antibiotics and too much antibacterial soaps and overly hygienic conditions that it is to our detriment. Antibiotics must be taken with care and only when necessary. Bacteria have been around forever and we have learned about them since Louis Pasteur and other microbiologists but with the new technologies of gene sequencing and genomics, it is now possible to sequence every gene and get a complete detail of every microbiome. With our understanding of evolution, we know that all life has co-evolved within close contact with microbes. And with our fast expanding knowledge of these microbes, we are learning how to eradicate diseases and learn how to live with them symbiotically.This book covers a very interesting array of topics about microbes in an understandable way and is for you if you are interested in microbiology."

A world that pre-existed the one of all more complicated life forms and that every other creature has had to accommodate to.I’m on day five of influenza and am sorely not up to writing the titillating review this book deserves. I am hoping my virus infection does not result in a bacterial infection that would need antibiotics. Bacteria evolve at a blistering speed by gene transfer, so resistance is almost instantaneous. Furthermore, a dose of antibiotics would put my gut microbes into havoc, possibly decimating the colonies I would like to keep and let more nasty ones settle. But no, you cannot treat a viral infection itself with antibiotics! Please! Our microbiomes aren’t inherently good or bad. There is no such thing as a good bug or a bad bug. Some play along the entire scale anyway. What has become clear is that our obsession with cleanliness is counterproductive, causing autoimmune diseases such as asthma. We need to train our immune systems to not be jittery and overreact.This book deserves to be read. It’s well told and entertaining, while being immensely informative."
288,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,4,"If you’re a physician, a nutritionist, or have studied biology, you’re probably aware that our bodies contain an immense number of microbes. Most of the rest of us find that surprising. Though I knew about the bugs that inhabit my digestive system, British science journalist Ed Yong helped me understand just how numerous and widely dispersed those microbes are on my body—and yours. Try 39 trillion. That number’s greater than the estimated number of human cells in our bodies. And it’s 100 times as great as the largest estimate of the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. In other words, it’s an understatement to say that the number of microbes we contain is astronomical.Should we fear the microbes within us?Now, before you panic about the many diseases you’ll contract from all these bugs, rest assured. “There are fewer than 100 species of bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans,” as Yong explains in I Contain Multitudes. “By contrast, the thousands of species in our guts are mostly harmless.” And a great many of them play indispensable roles in keeping us alive and disease-free. They bolster our immune system, digest our food, and even help make us who we are.How did this come about? “Remember that animals emerged in a world that had already been teeming with microbes for billions of years,” Yong notes. “They were the rulers of the planet long before we arrived. And when we did arrive, of course we evolved ways of interacting with the microbes around us.”The world within usThe collection of microbes in each of us is generally called the microbiome. Yong explains its functions and its fathomless diversity in conversational English with occasional flashes of humor. “Every one of us is a zoo in our own right,” he writes. “A colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collective. An entire world. . . Some species are common, but none is everywhere.” And that collection of species is unique to each of us. The microbes in my gut and on my skin are very different from those in and on you. Not only that but “your right hand shares just a sixth of its microbial species with your left hand.”The symbiosis spectrumThe theme of I Contain Multitudes is symbiosis. In common parlance, symbiosis suggests mutual benefit. Technically, though, the meaning is broader. “If one partner benefited at the expense of the other, it was a parasite (or a pathogen if it caused disease). If it benefited without affecting its host, it was a commensal. If it benefited its host, it was a mutualist. All these styles of coexistence fell under the rubric of symbiosis.” Yong’s book includes a huge number of examples, not just within our own bodies but in animals and plants as well. If you have an affinity for science, you’ll love this book.By the way, “there is no such thing as a ‘good microbe’ or a ‘bad microbe’ . . . In reality, bacteria exist along a continuum of lifestyles, between ‘bad’ parasites and ‘good’ mutualists. Some microbes . . . slide from one end of the parasite-mutualist spectrum to the other, depending on the strain, and on the host they find themselves in.” The possibilities of these combinations are endless.The ever-evolving field of biologyYong will take you on a tour of the laboratories where scientists study symbiosis and its effects on its many hosts in other living things. You’ll meet the pioneers in the field—a fascinating lot, few of whom match the stereotype of the frizzy-haired, absent-minded professor. You’ll learn about the emerging fields of biogeography, metagenomics, and synthetic biology. And you’ll see how the discoveries in these fields are benefiting medical science—and portend more advances in the future.The title of this engrossing book is from Walt Whitman: “I am large. I contain multitudes.”About the authorBorn Edmund Soon-Weng Yong in 1981, Ed Yong is a staff member of The Atlantic. He has degrees in zoology and biochemistry from England’s most celebrated centers of scientific teaching and research, the University of Cambridge and University College London. His popular blog has been incorporated into the National Geographic online."
289,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/563794-amy,5,"I originally encountered this book when ordering it for a class at the high school where I work. I have to think that if I had read this book in high school, my life would have taken a different trajectory. I find the world of bacteria and fungi to be ridiculously fascinating. Since I started reading this book, I’ve started reading microbiology textbooks and even joined a local mycology society. I’m not sure what I can do with all of this fascination at this point in my life, but here I am. I made 102 highlights in this book. Where in the world do I start? First of all, I think it’s important to clear up the misconception microbes are mainly disease-causing germs. Viruses cause diseases, but fewer than 100 bacteria actually cause diseases. So many of them work in symbiosis with the creatures that they inhabit making them healthier overall. Many have evolved with their hosts. Some of the more interesting ones discussed in the book are microbes that work inside insects to do things that the insects couldn't do on their own (such as the protozoa inside termites which help to digest wood). I could read an entire book on microbes inside insects and be happy. One of the more intriguing microbes that works in our favor is the bacteriophage. Bacteriophages in our mucus act as a line of defense against bacteria that try to enter our bodies through our mouths and nose. A bacteriophage injects its DNA into an invading bacteria and then replicates itself many times over inside the bacteria. Then all these new baby bacteriophages burst out of the bacteria in a spectacular act of bactericide. Something I’ve thought for years is that we’re hurting ourselves by living in cities, staying indoors, not interacting with farm animals, sanitizing everything, swimming in chlorinated pools, washing our hands too often and with anti-bacterial soaps, taking too many baths, being overly-cautious about refrigerating food, etc. We're robbing ourselves of the good bacteria that once colonized us. As a result, we have more allergies, more inflammatory diseases, etc. Of course, I say this, but I can’t stand for my hands to be dirty. But I do notice a huge difference moving to the city and spending more time indoors than outdoors in the woods. Last time I went back to visit relatives who live in the pine-filled South, I was sneezing at pine pollen that never bothered me before. I’ve been trying to spend more time in the woods, even going so far as to fall into mud puddles while trail running. It’s all part of the master plan of gaining more microbes. At least I’ll tell myself that. When we take antibiotics, we know that we’re eliminating helpful bacteria as well as the bad bacteria infecting us. As a result, we’ve been led to believe that eating yogurt or probiotics can help restore our gut microbiome. And we've heard about our gut microbiome affecting obesity. It is true that several studies have shown that it appears that gut bacteria can determine our propensity toward obesity. For example, normal-sized mice have 3000 times more Akkermansia muciniphila than obese mice. When obese mice eat this bacteria, they lose weight and are less likely to have type 2 diabetes. However, studies have shown that eating yogurt doesn’t really change the gut biome in the long term and probiotics really can only shorten diarrhea brought about by the infection or the antibiotics. Probiotics an also save premature infants from death by necrotising entercolitis. Otherwise, neither yogurt nor probiotics do much good in restoring what we’ve lost. However, it is possible to restore our gut health by acquiring the right microbes. But the way that we do this may sound a little gross because it’s by cacophagy (ingesting feces in pill form) or fecal transplants. I noticed my dog doing this for herself on a walk the other day and had to tell myself that it wasn't gross; she was just treating herself to a free ecosystem transplant. Fecal transplant studies have been found to cure up to 94% of participants of certain maladies which is statistically amazing. Fecal transplants have been used to treat everything from obesity to gut issues to mental health issues. I feel like I need to reread this book a few times to really get everything from it. There are just so many things that are interesting in the world of microbes. I know this book only scratches the surface, but it does so in a way that’s easily readable and understandable. Sometimes when I was reading this, I found myself far more intrigued to see where a study went than to find out what was happening next in my fiction book. Not all authors of scientific subjects can manage to do that."
290,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I picked this book up recently from Audible (because they had a sale and I'm weak.) ((After writing that I remembered that as part of that sale I received a $5 credit and then went to Audible to scope out their daily deal to see if I wanted to use it on that. I. AM. WEAK.)) (((By the way, it's Leviathan Wakes, which I already own, and absolutely recommend. $5.95 - can't beat that price for the audio!))) But anyway, I've been reading and listening to a LOT of nonfiction this year, and this was right up my alley, so of course I would pick it up if it was on sale. And man, was this fascinating. I have never been the type of person who worries overmuch about cleanliness to the point of sterility, and this book has kind of made me feel justified in that. I learned a lot - some that worries me for the future of my preemie, c-section born, and formula-fed nephew's future gut health (because he didn't get a boost of beneficial microbes that vaginally born and breastfed babies usually get from their mothers)... but a lot more that makes me hopeful for a lot of other conditions and illnesses and diseases that could be treated or prevented with the right microbial application. The hubs and I have been probiotic fans for a while (him more religiously than I) and so it was a little disappointing to learn that for the most part, this is useless and bunk because any microbes ingested this way don't actually stick around to become part of our biome, but rather pass through as any other food would. But it is a thought in the right direction for how we think about health, and how we think about microbes. Far from the ""all bacteria are bad!"" model, we should be thinking about them as organisms that can be beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. To a mouse, a cat is always bad news. To a human relying on that cat to rid them of mice, the cat is beneficial. Sometimes we're the mouse, and sometimes we're the human, but the cat is always just the cat. I was really interested to learn how microbes have facilitated evolution and development for many, many animals through symbiosis. This part of the book was very fascinating to me, because we usually tend to think of an organism as suited to its environment on its own, but that isn't always the case. For some animals, the right microbe at the right time is necessary to reach maturity, or to be able to eat and digest certain foods, etc. Really interesting. I didn't love the reader for this audiobook. He wasn't bad, but he would pause oddly in the middle of sentences sometimes (especially toward the end of the book) and it would throw me off thinking that he was done with the sentence, only to continue the thought. Otherwise, the only little nitpick I had was that sometimes the way he pronounced things threw me off. Aside from that, I thought he did a fine job, and I really enjoyed the book."
291,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"A Most Engrossing Exploration of the Microbial Organisms Which Lurk Within UsEchoing Charles Darwin's concluding paragraph in the first edition of Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" in its subtitle, noted science journalist Ed Yong's ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life"" is an exceptional, quite riveting, account explaining how bacteria and other microbes have played - and continue to play - important roles in shaping the course of the history of life on our planet. Yong offers us a compelling account of microbial ecology - especially the human microbiome - that can be seen as a worthy successor to David Quammen's masterful book on biogeography, ""The Song of The Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction"", Quammen's other notable works on evolutionary biology and Carl Zimmer's excellent books ranging from microbiology to evolutionary biology. While Yong does not explicitly refer to the coevolution of bacteria and other microbes within their plant and animal hosts, he does stress the importance of the mutualistic aspects of coevolution, noting as the main theme of his book, symbiosis between microbes and those other, much larger, organisms for which they are the ""multitudes"" within them.Yong takes readers on a compelling journey through space and time, noting some of the most important figures in the history of microbiology as well as introducing us to important contemporary microbiologists, and especially, microbial ecologists, such as University of Texas, Austin entomologist Nancy A. Moran, who is highly regarded for her research into the coevolution of aphids with their microbiomes, and most recently, honeybees with theirs. There are also especially noteworthy biographical overviews of Antony van Leeuwenhoek, the inventor of the microscope, and the first serious scientific investigator of the microbial world, Carl Woese, the American microbiologist who discovered the Archaea, Earth's oldest - and most ""primitive"" - organisms, and Lynn Margulies, the maverick American biologist who developed the credible scientific theory of endosymbiosis, explaining the origin of the eukaryotic cell found in plants and animals. He also explains how the once popular germ theory of disease promoted first by the likes of Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur in the 19th Century - which treated virtually all microbes as germs that had to be destroyed to prevent humanity from suffering from germ-borne diseases - is giving way to a far more nuanced view of the microbes residing within us, as willing partners and occasionally, antagonists, which have played notable roles in our evolutionary histories while we have also been influencing theirs across the vast gulf of time.Yong asks us to see ourselves as individual ""islands"", drawing upon the scientific metaphor of island biogeography popularized by David Quammen in his seminal book, ""The Song of the Dodo"" and the subject of much notable ecological research from the 1960s to the present. We are ""islands"" inhabited by microbial denizens. He emphasizes this repeatedly, introducing us to species as bizarre as a squid that relies on luminous bacteria for fostering its growth from juvenile larvae to adult, and parthenogenetic female parasitic wasps relying on microbes that prevent the occurrence of reproductively fertile male wasps. He shows how important microbes are in facilitating digestion of otherwise inedible food, like grasses in the stomachs of ruminant mammals such as cows, goats and sheep. In humans, he notes how differing modes of birth - natural vaginal versus Caesarean section - will leave newborn infants with different microbiomes, that may have an important impact on the health of new-born infants. He also shows how current microbiome research in evolutionary medicine and environmental science, represents some of the newest frontiers in contemporary medicine and science.Ed Yong is such a compellingly gifted storyteller and prose stylist that ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life"" will simultaneously surprise, delight, and entertain its readers. There is never a dull moment lurking in the pages of Yong's book; instead, readers will be mesmerized from its opening pages to its very last. If Charles Darwin read Ed Yong's ""I Contain Multitudes"", he might conclude that it offers readers a much grander view of life than what he envisioned when he wrote ""On the Origin of Species"". He might admit to possessing after reading it, both a substantial understanding and appreciation for the microbial life that he never thought of when he ended ""On the Origin of Species"" with these eloquent observations; ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved."""
292,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"I Contain Multitudes  is an enjoyable and informative book that takes a look at how microbes live, where microbes live and their interactions with other species, including humans. This book contains many interesting scientific findings and microbial interactions - such as worms that don't have a mouth and don't need to eat; parasitic wasps with antibiotic antennae goo; viruses inside bacteria inside a bug; bacteria that influence which bugs get to breed; the effects of your microbial ecosystem in sickness and in health; as well as a whole lot of other fascinating stuff.The author has a personable writing style without turning into a semi-biography. He manages to explain scientific concepts without simplifying them too much or bogging the reader down with technical terminology. The beginning of the book is a bit disjointed in terms of story telling, but then gets better as the author goes along. I do wish Ed Yong had included more details about some of the topics discussed, but that was probably out of the scope for a popular science book like this.Other Recommended Books about Microbes:- March of the Microbes: Sighting the Unseen by John L.

293,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343721-becky,5,"This was cruising along at a pleasant 4 stars, but I had to bump it up when I got to the penultimate chapter. Here, the microbiomania was tempered by words of caution and foresight. For example, the lack of evidence that the lactic acid-producing bacteria survive the digestive track or even influence resident gut microbe communities, (most “probiotics” are mostly hype) while the bugs that HAVE shown clinical effects (e.g. in mice) should be wielded with much caution given that they are precisely more likely to establish themselves, and no organisms have only good or only bad effects. Even my favorite example of fecal transplants has really only been the miracle cure with C. diff infections, while the more complex IBD, obesity, and autism effects are clearly much more poorly understood. Still, there are amazing things on the horizon, and I love seeing that the actual reasearchers in the field are demonstrating that they have (finally) learned lessons from evolution and ecology and are trying to work with, rather than against, these forces. Balanced and rational arguments are so damned sexy."

The writing was awesome, very easy to read for those who are not into microbiology or animals. It’s definitely not a boring read, and I learned a lot from it.

So overall I enjoyed reading it.The reason for only three stars: the books structure is not great. He talks about an issue and revisits it again and again. It is lacking the flow, and feels like he is visiting the same points over and over again. I assume this is due to him writing a first lengthy book on a single subject. The narrative wanders a bit, and it is harder to follow from time to time.Also, some of the research presented in the book is preliminary and not conclusive. Even though he has a section on how we cannot infer cause-effect relationship of these findings, many instances of the book has premature conclusions.Overall, it was a fun to read book and taught me many new things. I recommend it, but do not expect this to be the ""best science book"" you'll read.I am sure with his talent and good storytelling skills he will get there, but this one is not it."

The population of Canada is (marginally) less than that. I can’t help but picture Pigpen from Charlie Brown walking around with his cloud of dirt. I also think what a great pity it is that the hospital I work in was designed with windows that are sealed shut, locking all of those pathogenic bacteria that we want to avoid inside with our patients. Think about that the next time you go to the hospital. "

They are the real dominant species on this planet. We live with them, we provide for them adn they work with us. The examples given in this book are really interesting, but what really blows my mind is how we can now start using them to improve the way we live and improve our planet."

I think it certainly deserves to be mentioned aside Elizabeth Kolbert's Sixth Extinction, Song of the Dodo, etc. I read a fair amount about biology and practiced it in the field (albeit in a wildly different specialty) and I was still shocked by some of the work going on in microbial bio today. Can't recommend it enough, for people interested in science and certainly for science fiction writers."
308,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"Reading a straight pop-science book is a nice change, and even better when the book covers super-interesting material, as Ed Yong’s I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life does. Where Yong lays bare research into inter-species cooperation that’s changing scientist’s views about natural selection. In the classic evolutionary/ biological view, it’s “us” against “the world.” Life is a struggle, red in tooth and claw. While that is true, it ignores that adaptive success that cooperation often provides. But unlike macro-cooperation (like a tight-knit African village banding together to raise all of their children collectively, or Microsoft and Intel working together to benefit both companies), Yong focuses on microbiological cooperation. You know. Those “probiotics” yogurt and supplement companies are so keen to foist on us, overstating the potential benefits of eating Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Which, as Yong points out, seldom if ever survive our stomach acids. But Yong digs deeper than shallow pop-cultural gee whiz. For instance, he introduces a theory that a positive “bacterial infection” may have led to human’s increased brain-size. He finds the evidence in probiotics present in human infants, passed to the via their mothers, that increase brain size. What’s more, they break down chemicals in breast milk that neither our guts nor other probiotics can. He also discusses the bacterial adaptations of termites, and how bacteria, molds and algae band together to create a healthy environment for corals, which create a lush habitat for a healthy reef’s assorted flora and fauna.And then I Contain Multitudes delves deeper, highlighting the ecological collapse of the tight webs of interconnected lives. He traces many biological disturbances, from dying coral reefs to human bacterial infection, to “dysbiosis,” an imbalance of the ecological order. Sometimes this imbalance provides a new, more adaptive order, like how recovery from an illness protects us from that bug via antibodies. At other times, like in a dying coral reef or Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a dysbiosis can settle into a chilling, almost dead stasis.On a related, if and gross side-note that appeals to my inner 14-year-old science-geek (for the record, that’s many decades behind me), Yong spends a chapter discussing Fecal Microbiota Transplants. It’s as potty-humor funny as it sounds. Here, doctors (or alternative medicine quacks) shoot a slurry of healthy people’s poop into sick people’s rectums via a high-pressure enema. Though silly and gross-sounding, this procedure often cures dysbiotic ailments, such as Crohn’s Disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, albeit with risks. [FYI from my Inner Adult: Since there are risks, it's best to avoid alternative medical woo-woo and consult an MD for Fecal Matter Transplants. Which, despite the potty humor, is no laughing matter. Here’s a WebMD article that oulines the risk/ reward using the best available science: http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disord... ]My main criticism of the book is the gee-whiz visionaries and entrepreneurs, hoping to cash-in “using the science or probiotics” to create healthier human cityscapes and dwellings. Since scientific efforts like this have a storied history of failure. Like the kudzu that’s overtaking the southeast, which the Soil Erosion Service paid farmers to plant in fallow fields to avoid the next Dust Bowl, only to have it “take off,” overtaking about 2,500 acres of land in the south each year. Or the FDA introducing carp, a delicacy in European cuisines, as a source of farm income, only to discover that American-raised carp taste muddy compared to those raised in Europe. Problem was, byt the time they'd discovered this, carp eggs were “in the wild,” spreading like a plague, displacing native fish populations and destroying the habitat of others. These two failures of ""scientific solutions"" are illustrative: many more exist. So needless to say, this skeptic won’t hold his breath. Like the antibiotic craze that’s created or current dysbiosis and given rise to higher-than-average allergies, asthmas and other autoimmune diseases, this “cure” will likely create a new dysbiosis. Flaws (and new-fangled tech gee-whiz) aside, I enjoyed Ed Yong’s I Contain Multitudes. I recommend it without reservation to fans of science books. The material is engaging, new and interesting. And very important. I was tempted to give it five stars, but something held me back. So I’m going with my four-star (and probiotic rich) gut in saying “four-stars.” . "
309,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"The first paragraph of the book's description perfectly describes it for me. Yong didn't just tell me how important my microbiome is, by the end of book, I felt it. There he really missed a perfect picture for me - that of Pigpen from the Peanuts strip by Charles Shultz. We aren't discrete beings making our lonely way through the world, but continually changing clouds of bacteria influencing & being influenced by our surroundings plant, animal, & mineral due to our incredible ecologies. That's not an overstatement & Yong gives plenty of examples throughout the book.We didn't evolve in a vacuum, bacteria have constantly drenched every living organism. Most don't have much to do with us, but many find a home within the newcomers, the more complex hosts, & they act like good house guests. Sometimes they move in to stay & provide services (symbiot). Occasionally they get out of line (disbiosis) & far more rarely they're bad. He gives fascinating examples of all states.He really shined with his descriptions of how one variety mosquitoes are altered to not carry disease. I've heard about such efforts, but never knew any of the methods. He'd mentioned & had given enough details about the bacterial strain Wolbachia that when he got around to telling how scientists were infecting mosquitoes that carried Dengue fever with it in an attempt to eradicate the disease, it made perfect sense & I'm not a scientist of any sort. IOW, his explanations were all good & accessible.His discussion of balances within the microbiotic community were especially interesting to me since both my wife & daughter have stomach issues. I had no idea how much or quickly such things could change. A mere change in diet of a day can completely change the balance of our gut bacteria while a course of antibiotics can be catastrophic. Of course, we have to balance the risks of destroying gut bacteria against dying of another infection that the antibiotic is being taken for. Often there isn't a definite or even a good answer, but a guess based on probabilities. It's messy & defies simplification so beware of miracle cures. In a few decades a doctor might be able to tailor a bacterial cocktail for your particular symptoms & biome, but the science is in its infancy. One of the places it is starting is with Fecal Matter Transfer (FMT). Gross, but it's been routinely carried out for those whose systems are in such distress that they're losing weight & wearing diapers. A colonoscopy that plants a donor's poop up their own intestines often fixes the problem, at least for a time. Now they're refining this to cultures that are contained in a capsule. yes, they give out a poo pill! Apparently our species' aversion to eating poo isn't exactly the norm in the animal kingdom. Rabbits & rats have to eat their own or else they get a vitamin deficiency. Other species regularly eat other's poo & it's one way beneficial bacteria spread & inoculate them. It can also lead to similar smells among them fostering a sense of community. Who knew? Fascinating!I was really surprised by the example of Sea World keeping the dolphin's water too clean. Anyone who has had an aquarium knows it takes a while to balance the system & clear up the water. It's not dirt, but the bio-balance, so it's often best to start a new tank by taking water from an existing aquarium. I never changed more than 1/3 of the water per week, a rule of thumb that was told to me early on by seemingly everyone. Ivory tower syndrome?While this is rather long & sagged a bit about 2/3-3/4 of the way through (at least I wandered a bit) I highly recommend reading it all the way through. The end is great & well worth the journey. My edition was well narrated & easily understood. I did get the ebook to refer to, but didn't have to very often - mostly just for the name & spelling of some terms & names.Highly recommended!"
310,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna,5,"This was a fascinating book. I’ve heard of gut microbiota and faecal microbiome transfer, but there was tons of new information. One of the most important concepts for me was that the microbiome is necessary for the normal development and functioning of higher organisms. One of the main targets for research is the gut:“The weird biology of germ-free animals is most obvious in the gut. A well-functioning gut needs a big surface area for absorbing nutrients, which is why its walls are densely lined with long, finger-like pillars. It needs to constantly regenerate the cells at its surface, which get sloughed off by the passing tide of food. It needs a rich network of underlying blood vessels to carry nutrients to and fro. And it needs to be sealed – its cells must stick tightly to each other to prevent foreign molecules (and microbes) from leaking into those blood vessels. All of these essential properties are compromised without microbes.If zebrafish or mice grow up in the absence of bacteria their guts don’t develop fully, (which) can be rectified simply by giving the animals a normal complement of microbes or even isolated microbial molecules. The bacteria don’t physically reshape the gut themselves. Instead, they work via their hosts...Lora Hooper demonstrated this by infusing into germ-free mice a common gut bacterium called Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron – or B-theta to its friends. She found that the microbe activated a wide range of mouse genes that are involved in absorbing nutrients, building an impermeable barrier, breaking down toxins, creating blood vessels, and creating mature cells.”The microbiome is also essential in the early development and the normal functioning of the mature immune system:… an animal’s genome doesn’t provide everything it needs to create a mature immune system. It also needs input from a microbiome. Hundreds of scientific papers, on species as diverse as mice, tsetse flies and zebrafish, have shown that microbes help to shape the immune system in some way. They influence the creation of entire classes of immune cells, and the development of organs that make and store those cells. They are especially important early in life, when the immunity machine is first constructed and tunes itself to the big, bad world. And once the machine is chugging away, microbes continue to calibrate its reactions to threats.I found it fascinating that breast milk doesn’t just contain antibodies to protect the infant, it also contains special oligosaccharides: „scientists have identified over 200 human milk oligosaccharides, or HMOs, so far” that the infant can’t digest. Breast-fed infants carry Bifidobacteria in their guts. “HMOs are not an all-purpose food for Bifs. [] the sugars selectively nourish one particular subspecies called Bifidobacterium longum infantis, or B. infantis for short. As long as you provide it with HMOs, it will outcompete any other gut bacterium.” [] As it digests HMOs, B. infantis releases short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that feed an infant’s gut cells – so while mothers nourish this microbe, the microbe in turn nourishes the baby. Through direct contact, B. infantis also encourages gut cells to make adhesive proteins that seal the gaps between them, and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system.”There are also chapters dealing with how microbes play a role in the life and death of coral reefs, symbionts in insects, how symbiosis is a precarious balance and only advantageous when the microbes are in the right place at the right time… I could go on, but you must read it yourself. I think it will be an engrossing read for anyone who is interested in science, symbiosis, evolution, ecology, hygiene…"
311,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1192324-ana,5,"This will be a difficult book to review, because I find myself short of words to express how good it is! Ed Yong is a science journalist and an amazing story teller. He masters the difficult art of delivering detailed and scientifically accurate information in an agreeable way, without scaring away the layman reader while satisfying someone with knowledge in the field as well. In fact, he manages to make it so interesting that I often found myself glued to the pages and sometimes reading parts of the text aloud to my daughters.Yong’s erudition is visible in many ways, including the several links he makes with literature, which begin right with the title of the book, a verse taken from a poem by Walt Whitman, ”Song to myself”.In the introduction, Yong describes a visit to a zoo with a microbiologist, to collect samples from a white-bellied pangolin – in his words, “an utterly endearing animal that looks like a cross between an anteater and a pine cone.” What starts like a novel, quickly gives way to an overview of the different types of microbes that live on, within and around every animal. We find ourselves amazed by the variety and ubiquity of these beings and we know we’re trapped: our curiosity has been stirred and we will not stop reading this book!The first chapter of the book is a summary of the evolution of life on Earth, framing the appearance of the human being in relation to other life forms, and especially single-cell ones:“All the visible organisms we’re familiar with, everything that springs to mind when we think of ‘nature’, are latecomers to life’s story. For most of the tale, microbes were the only living things on Earth” (more precisely, from March to October, in an imaginary calendar that we can use if we collapse the planet’s entire 4.54 billion years old history into one year, to make it manageable by our brains; in this calendar, humans have only existed for the last 30 min of December 31).The second chapter is a condensed historical overview of the “discovery” of microbes by man and the way knowledge and our general perception of this group has evolved. It finishes with a visit to a museum in the Netherlands dedicated to microscopic life, that I absolutely need to visit: Micropia (https://www.micropia.nl/en/)From here onwards, each chapter follows the work and the recent discoveries of scientists working in different parts of the world with different microbe groups and applications (ecology, agriculture, human health…). I am not making a summary or giving away any spoilers, but suffice to say that although I am not a complete layman in this field, I still found myself amazed and fascinated enough to ponder enrolling on a microbiology online course just to freshen up my long forgotten and outdated knowledge in this field.As far as I could find out, this was Ed Yong’s first book. I can’t wait to read his next one, although I am prepared to wait, as I am sure books like these take a very long time to write. This is very clear from the dozens of people he interviewed, laboratories he visited and publications he consulted. The book has around 70 pages of notes and bibliography, which I found myself constantly referring to.For those who are still thinking whether they should read this book, I am leaving a link to a talk given by Ed Yong himself about his book on the day it was published. I am sure he will convince you himself:https://edyong.me/i-contain-multitudes/"

I read this as part of the May #AsianReadathon, and listened to the audiobook which is well narrated by Charlie Anson.I loved biology as a kid, and was that kid who read every single book she could get her hands on. So much so, that my Mom, a Bio and Chemistry teacher, had to keep them away from me so I would study other subjects. This wonderful book took me back to those days of sheer delight and wonderment at learning such cool stuff.This nonfiction book is wide reaching in scope, but takes deep dives on specific themes. Homo Sapiens often forget that we are relatively really late to this game called life, and that microbes have been around (and dominant) for much, much, much longer. It should then not be a surprise that all other life forms evolved with/around microbes. It's not news today that we are all covered (internally and externally) with trillions of microbes, but it's not often that we look at the world from the microbes point of view. This book explores the history, zoology, ecology, and biology of microbes and how they affect every single living thing on the planet in a myriad of ways. We often tend to focus on the bad guys - the pathogens - but that's like learning about terrorists, and assuming all that kind of people are terrorists. Not remotely true. I was educated, entertained, entranced, my mental maps where changed, and I will never look the world the same again. It was rather like a flat lander learning that the planet is not in fact flat. I do not exaggerate. The writing is really good, and covers a lot of ground in an easily digestible manner without dumbing things down. I appreciated the author's respect for the people on the front lines of the field, and the humor interspersed throughout. I loved every minute. I just learned the author covers science for The Atlantic, and I've added all his articles to my TBR list.Why might you care about microbes you ask? Well, from the book blurb: Many people think of microbes as germs to be eradicated, but those that live with us—the microbiome—build our bodies, protect our health, shape our identities, and grant us incredible abilities. You choose to remain ignorant at your own peril!"

Also gives a good argument for not trying to create hygenic, sterile, too-clean environments because they reduce our microbe populations and leave us vulnerable to invasion by bad things.

315,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,4,"This was an interesting book about the microbes inside us and around us and that are everywhere. This book goes into a lot of detail about the symbiosis between the microbes and other organisms, humans and animals. They are essential for life in all aspects, in digestion, our immune systems, and every other aspect of life. We would not be here today without them. It is also important to know that most microbes are not harmful. We have become so fixated on getting rid of them by too many antibiotics and too much antibacterial soaps and overly hygienic conditions that it is to our detriment. Antibiotics must be taken with care and only when necessary. Bacteria have been around forever and we have learned about them since Louis Pasteur and other microbiologists but with the new technologies of gene sequencing and genomics, it is now possible to sequence every gene and get a complete detail of every microbiome. With our understanding of evolution, we know that all life has co-evolved within close contact with microbes. And with our fast expanding knowledge of these microbes, we are learning how to eradicate diseases and learn how to live with them symbiotically.This book covers a very interesting array of topics about microbes in an understandable way and is for you if you are interested in microbiology."

A world that pre-existed the one of all more complicated life forms and that every other creature has had to accommodate to.I’m on day five of influenza and am sorely not up to writing the titillating review this book deserves. I am hoping my virus infection does not result in a bacterial infection that would need antibiotics. Bacteria evolve at a blistering speed by gene transfer, so resistance is almost instantaneous. Furthermore, a dose of antibiotics would put my gut microbes into havoc, possibly decimating the colonies I would like to keep and let more nasty ones settle. But no, you cannot treat a viral infection itself with antibiotics! Please! Our microbiomes aren’t inherently good or bad. There is no such thing as a good bug or a bad bug. Some play along the entire scale anyway. What has become clear is that our obsession with cleanliness is counterproductive, causing autoimmune diseases such as asthma. We need to train our immune systems to not be jittery and overreact.This book deserves to be read. It’s well told and entertaining, while being immensely informative."
318,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,4,"If you’re a physician, a nutritionist, or have studied biology, you’re probably aware that our bodies contain an immense number of microbes. Most of the rest of us find that surprising. Though I knew about the bugs that inhabit my digestive system, British science journalist Ed Yong helped me understand just how numerous and widely dispersed those microbes are on my body—and yours. Try 39 trillion. That number’s greater than the estimated number of human cells in our bodies. And it’s 100 times as great as the largest estimate of the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. In other words, it’s an understatement to say that the number of microbes we contain is astronomical.Should we fear the microbes within us?Now, before you panic about the many diseases you’ll contract from all these bugs, rest assured. “There are fewer than 100 species of bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans,” as Yong explains in I Contain Multitudes. “By contrast, the thousands of species in our guts are mostly harmless.” And a great many of them play indispensable roles in keeping us alive and disease-free. They bolster our immune system, digest our food, and even help make us who we are.How did this come about? “Remember that animals emerged in a world that had already been teeming with microbes for billions of years,” Yong notes. “They were the rulers of the planet long before we arrived. And when we did arrive, of course we evolved ways of interacting with the microbes around us.”The world within usThe collection of microbes in each of us is generally called the microbiome. Yong explains its functions and its fathomless diversity in conversational English with occasional flashes of humor. “Every one of us is a zoo in our own right,” he writes. “A colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collective. An entire world. . . Some species are common, but none is everywhere.” And that collection of species is unique to each of us. The microbes in my gut and on my skin are very different from those in and on you. Not only that but “your right hand shares just a sixth of its microbial species with your left hand.”The symbiosis spectrumThe theme of I Contain Multitudes is symbiosis. In common parlance, symbiosis suggests mutual benefit. Technically, though, the meaning is broader. “If one partner benefited at the expense of the other, it was a parasite (or a pathogen if it caused disease). If it benefited without affecting its host, it was a commensal. If it benefited its host, it was a mutualist. All these styles of coexistence fell under the rubric of symbiosis.” Yong’s book includes a huge number of examples, not just within our own bodies but in animals and plants as well. If you have an affinity for science, you’ll love this book.By the way, “there is no such thing as a ‘good microbe’ or a ‘bad microbe’ . . . In reality, bacteria exist along a continuum of lifestyles, between ‘bad’ parasites and ‘good’ mutualists. Some microbes . . . slide from one end of the parasite-mutualist spectrum to the other, depending on the strain, and on the host they find themselves in.” The possibilities of these combinations are endless.The ever-evolving field of biologyYong will take you on a tour of the laboratories where scientists study symbiosis and its effects on its many hosts in other living things. You’ll meet the pioneers in the field—a fascinating lot, few of whom match the stereotype of the frizzy-haired, absent-minded professor. You’ll learn about the emerging fields of biogeography, metagenomics, and synthetic biology. And you’ll see how the discoveries in these fields are benefiting medical science—and portend more advances in the future.The title of this engrossing book is from Walt Whitman: “I am large. I contain multitudes.”About the authorBorn Edmund Soon-Weng Yong in 1981, Ed Yong is a staff member of The Atlantic. He has degrees in zoology and biochemistry from England’s most celebrated centers of scientific teaching and research, the University of Cambridge and University College London. His popular blog has been incorporated into the National Geographic online."
319,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/563794-amy,5,"I originally encountered this book when ordering it for a class at the high school where I work. I have to think that if I had read this book in high school, my life would have taken a different trajectory. I find the world of bacteria and fungi to be ridiculously fascinating. Since I started reading this book, I’ve started reading microbiology textbooks and even joined a local mycology society. I’m not sure what I can do with all of this fascination at this point in my life, but here I am. I made 102 highlights in this book. Where in the world do I start? First of all, I think it’s important to clear up the misconception microbes are mainly disease-causing germs. Viruses cause diseases, but fewer than 100 bacteria actually cause diseases. So many of them work in symbiosis with the creatures that they inhabit making them healthier overall. Many have evolved with their hosts. Some of the more interesting ones discussed in the book are microbes that work inside insects to do things that the insects couldn't do on their own (such as the protozoa inside termites which help to digest wood). I could read an entire book on microbes inside insects and be happy. One of the more intriguing microbes that works in our favor is the bacteriophage. Bacteriophages in our mucus act as a line of defense against bacteria that try to enter our bodies through our mouths and nose. A bacteriophage injects its DNA into an invading bacteria and then replicates itself many times over inside the bacteria. Then all these new baby bacteriophages burst out of the bacteria in a spectacular act of bactericide. Something I’ve thought for years is that we’re hurting ourselves by living in cities, staying indoors, not interacting with farm animals, sanitizing everything, swimming in chlorinated pools, washing our hands too often and with anti-bacterial soaps, taking too many baths, being overly-cautious about refrigerating food, etc. We're robbing ourselves of the good bacteria that once colonized us. As a result, we have more allergies, more inflammatory diseases, etc. Of course, I say this, but I can’t stand for my hands to be dirty. But I do notice a huge difference moving to the city and spending more time indoors than outdoors in the woods. Last time I went back to visit relatives who live in the pine-filled South, I was sneezing at pine pollen that never bothered me before. I’ve been trying to spend more time in the woods, even going so far as to fall into mud puddles while trail running. It’s all part of the master plan of gaining more microbes. At least I’ll tell myself that. When we take antibiotics, we know that we’re eliminating helpful bacteria as well as the bad bacteria infecting us. As a result, we’ve been led to believe that eating yogurt or probiotics can help restore our gut microbiome. And we've heard about our gut microbiome affecting obesity. It is true that several studies have shown that it appears that gut bacteria can determine our propensity toward obesity. For example, normal-sized mice have 3000 times more Akkermansia muciniphila than obese mice. When obese mice eat this bacteria, they lose weight and are less likely to have type 2 diabetes. However, studies have shown that eating yogurt doesn’t really change the gut biome in the long term and probiotics really can only shorten diarrhea brought about by the infection or the antibiotics. Probiotics an also save premature infants from death by necrotising entercolitis. Otherwise, neither yogurt nor probiotics do much good in restoring what we’ve lost. However, it is possible to restore our gut health by acquiring the right microbes. But the way that we do this may sound a little gross because it’s by cacophagy (ingesting feces in pill form) or fecal transplants. I noticed my dog doing this for herself on a walk the other day and had to tell myself that it wasn't gross; she was just treating herself to a free ecosystem transplant. Fecal transplant studies have been found to cure up to 94% of participants of certain maladies which is statistically amazing. Fecal transplants have been used to treat everything from obesity to gut issues to mental health issues. I feel like I need to reread this book a few times to really get everything from it. There are just so many things that are interesting in the world of microbes. I know this book only scratches the surface, but it does so in a way that’s easily readable and understandable. Sometimes when I was reading this, I found myself far more intrigued to see where a study went than to find out what was happening next in my fiction book. Not all authors of scientific subjects can manage to do that."
320,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I picked this book up recently from Audible (because they had a sale and I'm weak.) ((After writing that I remembered that as part of that sale I received a $5 credit and then went to Audible to scope out their daily deal to see if I wanted to use it on that. I. AM. WEAK.)) (((By the way, it's Leviathan Wakes, which I already own, and absolutely recommend. $5.95 - can't beat that price for the audio!))) But anyway, I've been reading and listening to a LOT of nonfiction this year, and this was right up my alley, so of course I would pick it up if it was on sale. And man, was this fascinating. I have never been the type of person who worries overmuch about cleanliness to the point of sterility, and this book has kind of made me feel justified in that. I learned a lot - some that worries me for the future of my preemie, c-section born, and formula-fed nephew's future gut health (because he didn't get a boost of beneficial microbes that vaginally born and breastfed babies usually get from their mothers)... but a lot more that makes me hopeful for a lot of other conditions and illnesses and diseases that could be treated or prevented with the right microbial application. The hubs and I have been probiotic fans for a while (him more religiously than I) and so it was a little disappointing to learn that for the most part, this is useless and bunk because any microbes ingested this way don't actually stick around to become part of our biome, but rather pass through as any other food would. But it is a thought in the right direction for how we think about health, and how we think about microbes. Far from the ""all bacteria are bad!"" model, we should be thinking about them as organisms that can be beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. To a mouse, a cat is always bad news. To a human relying on that cat to rid them of mice, the cat is beneficial. Sometimes we're the mouse, and sometimes we're the human, but the cat is always just the cat. I was really interested to learn how microbes have facilitated evolution and development for many, many animals through symbiosis. This part of the book was very fascinating to me, because we usually tend to think of an organism as suited to its environment on its own, but that isn't always the case. For some animals, the right microbe at the right time is necessary to reach maturity, or to be able to eat and digest certain foods, etc. Really interesting. I didn't love the reader for this audiobook. He wasn't bad, but he would pause oddly in the middle of sentences sometimes (especially toward the end of the book) and it would throw me off thinking that he was done with the sentence, only to continue the thought. Otherwise, the only little nitpick I had was that sometimes the way he pronounced things threw me off. Aside from that, I thought he did a fine job, and I really enjoyed the book."
321,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"A Most Engrossing Exploration of the Microbial Organisms Which Lurk Within UsEchoing Charles Darwin's concluding paragraph in the first edition of Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" in its subtitle, noted science journalist Ed Yong's ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life"" is an exceptional, quite riveting, account explaining how bacteria and other microbes have played - and continue to play - important roles in shaping the course of the history of life on our planet. Yong offers us a compelling account of microbial ecology - especially the human microbiome - that can be seen as a worthy successor to David Quammen's masterful book on biogeography, ""The Song of The Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction"", Quammen's other notable works on evolutionary biology and Carl Zimmer's excellent books ranging from microbiology to evolutionary biology. While Yong does not explicitly refer to the coevolution of bacteria and other microbes within their plant and animal hosts, he does stress the importance of the mutualistic aspects of coevolution, noting as the main theme of his book, symbiosis between microbes and those other, much larger, organisms for which they are the ""multitudes"" within them.Yong takes readers on a compelling journey through space and time, noting some of the most important figures in the history of microbiology as well as introducing us to important contemporary microbiologists, and especially, microbial ecologists, such as University of Texas, Austin entomologist Nancy A. Moran, who is highly regarded for her research into the coevolution of aphids with their microbiomes, and most recently, honeybees with theirs. There are also especially noteworthy biographical overviews of Antony van Leeuwenhoek, the inventor of the microscope, and the first serious scientific investigator of the microbial world, Carl Woese, the American microbiologist who discovered the Archaea, Earth's oldest - and most ""primitive"" - organisms, and Lynn Margulies, the maverick American biologist who developed the credible scientific theory of endosymbiosis, explaining the origin of the eukaryotic cell found in plants and animals. He also explains how the once popular germ theory of disease promoted first by the likes of Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur in the 19th Century - which treated virtually all microbes as germs that had to be destroyed to prevent humanity from suffering from germ-borne diseases - is giving way to a far more nuanced view of the microbes residing within us, as willing partners and occasionally, antagonists, which have played notable roles in our evolutionary histories while we have also been influencing theirs across the vast gulf of time.Yong asks us to see ourselves as individual ""islands"", drawing upon the scientific metaphor of island biogeography popularized by David Quammen in his seminal book, ""The Song of the Dodo"" and the subject of much notable ecological research from the 1960s to the present. We are ""islands"" inhabited by microbial denizens. He emphasizes this repeatedly, introducing us to species as bizarre as a squid that relies on luminous bacteria for fostering its growth from juvenile larvae to adult, and parthenogenetic female parasitic wasps relying on microbes that prevent the occurrence of reproductively fertile male wasps. He shows how important microbes are in facilitating digestion of otherwise inedible food, like grasses in the stomachs of ruminant mammals such as cows, goats and sheep. In humans, he notes how differing modes of birth - natural vaginal versus Caesarean section - will leave newborn infants with different microbiomes, that may have an important impact on the health of new-born infants. He also shows how current microbiome research in evolutionary medicine and environmental science, represents some of the newest frontiers in contemporary medicine and science.Ed Yong is such a compellingly gifted storyteller and prose stylist that ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life"" will simultaneously surprise, delight, and entertain its readers. There is never a dull moment lurking in the pages of Yong's book; instead, readers will be mesmerized from its opening pages to its very last. If Charles Darwin read Ed Yong's ""I Contain Multitudes"", he might conclude that it offers readers a much grander view of life than what he envisioned when he wrote ""On the Origin of Species"". He might admit to possessing after reading it, both a substantial understanding and appreciation for the microbial life that he never thought of when he ended ""On the Origin of Species"" with these eloquent observations; ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved."""
322,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"I Contain Multitudes  is an enjoyable and informative book that takes a look at how microbes live, where microbes live and their interactions with other species, including humans. This book contains many interesting scientific findings and microbial interactions - such as worms that don't have a mouth and don't need to eat; parasitic wasps with antibiotic antennae goo; viruses inside bacteria inside a bug; bacteria that influence which bugs get to breed; the effects of your microbial ecosystem in sickness and in health; as well as a whole lot of other fascinating stuff.The author has a personable writing style without turning into a semi-biography. He manages to explain scientific concepts without simplifying them too much or bogging the reader down with technical terminology. The beginning of the book is a bit disjointed in terms of story telling, but then gets better as the author goes along. I do wish Ed Yong had included more details about some of the topics discussed, but that was probably out of the scope for a popular science book like this.Other Recommended Books about Microbes:- March of the Microbes: Sighting the Unseen by John L.

Here, the microbiomania was tempered by words of caution and foresight. For example, the lack of evidence that the lactic acid-producing bacteria survive the digestive track or even influence resident gut microbe communities, (most “probiotics” are mostly hype) while the bugs that HAVE shown clinical effects (e.g. in mice) should be wielded with much caution given that they are precisely more likely to establish themselves, and no organisms have only good or only bad effects. Even my favorite example of fecal transplants has really only been the miracle cure with C. diff infections, while the more complex IBD, obesity, and autism effects are clearly much more poorly understood. Still, there are amazing things on the horizon, and I love seeing that the actual reasearchers in the field are demonstrating that they have (finally) learned lessons from evolution and ecology and are trying to work with, rather than against, these forces. Balanced and rational arguments are so damned sexy."

The writing was awesome, very easy to read for those who are not into microbiology or animals. It’s definitely not a boring read, and I learned a lot from it. The research that went into this about how long ago is very evident, which makes the more that much more interesting to read.

It felt like a lot work to read without sufficient payoff. I feel more knowledgable about science and biology than the average person but I always felt a little behind in the science throughout. There were clearly interesting parts but they were outweighed by a writing and organizational style that felt unstructured and wandering.

So overall I enjoyed reading it.The reason for only three stars: the books structure is not great. He talks about an issue and revisits it again and again. It is lacking the flow, and feels like he is visiting the same points over and over again. I assume this is due to him writing a first lengthy book on a single subject. The narrative wanders a bit, and it is harder to follow from time to time.Also, some of the research presented in the book is preliminary and not conclusive. Even though he has a section on how we cannot infer cause-effect relationship of these findings, many instances of the book has premature conclusions.Overall, it was a fun to read book and taught me many new things. I recommend it, but do not expect this to be the ""best science book"" you'll read.I am sure with his talent and good storytelling skills he will get there, but this one is not it."

The population of Canada is (marginally) less than that. I can’t help but picture Pigpen from Charlie Brown walking around with his cloud of dirt. I also think what a great pity it is that the hospital I work in was designed with windows that are sealed shut, locking all of those pathogenic bacteria that we want to avoid inside with our patients. Think about that the next time you go to the hospital. "

338,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"Reading a straight pop-science book is a nice change, and even better when the book covers super-interesting material, as Ed Yong’s I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life does. Where Yong lays bare research into inter-species cooperation that’s changing scientist’s views about natural selection. In the classic evolutionary/ biological view, it’s “us” against “the world.” Life is a struggle, red in tooth and claw. While that is true, it ignores that adaptive success that cooperation often provides. But unlike macro-cooperation (like a tight-knit African village banding together to raise all of their children collectively, or Microsoft and Intel working together to benefit both companies), Yong focuses on microbiological cooperation. You know. Those “probiotics” yogurt and supplement companies are so keen to foist on us, overstating the potential benefits of eating Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Which, as Yong points out, seldom if ever survive our stomach acids. But Yong digs deeper than shallow pop-cultural gee whiz. For instance, he introduces a theory that a positive “bacterial infection” may have led to human’s increased brain-size. He finds the evidence in probiotics present in human infants, passed to the via their mothers, that increase brain size. What’s more, they break down chemicals in breast milk that neither our guts nor other probiotics can. He also discusses the bacterial adaptations of termites, and how bacteria, molds and algae band together to create a healthy environment for corals, which create a lush habitat for a healthy reef’s assorted flora and fauna.And then I Contain Multitudes delves deeper, highlighting the ecological collapse of the tight webs of interconnected lives. He traces many biological disturbances, from dying coral reefs to human bacterial infection, to “dysbiosis,” an imbalance of the ecological order. Sometimes this imbalance provides a new, more adaptive order, like how recovery from an illness protects us from that bug via antibodies. At other times, like in a dying coral reef or Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a dysbiosis can settle into a chilling, almost dead stasis.On a related, if and gross side-note that appeals to my inner 14-year-old science-geek (for the record, that’s many decades behind me), Yong spends a chapter discussing Fecal Microbiota Transplants. It’s as potty-humor funny as it sounds. Here, doctors (or alternative medicine quacks) shoot a slurry of healthy people’s poop into sick people’s rectums via a high-pressure enema. Though silly and gross-sounding, this procedure often cures dysbiotic ailments, such as Crohn’s Disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, albeit with risks. [FYI from my Inner Adult: Since there are risks, it's best to avoid alternative medical woo-woo and consult an MD for Fecal Matter Transplants. Which, despite the potty humor, is no laughing matter. Here’s a WebMD article that oulines the risk/ reward using the best available science: http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disord... ]My main criticism of the book is the gee-whiz visionaries and entrepreneurs, hoping to cash-in “using the science or probiotics” to create healthier human cityscapes and dwellings. Since scientific efforts like this have a storied history of failure. Like the kudzu that’s overtaking the southeast, which the Soil Erosion Service paid farmers to plant in fallow fields to avoid the next Dust Bowl, only to have it “take off,” overtaking about 2,500 acres of land in the south each year. Or the FDA introducing carp, a delicacy in European cuisines, as a source of farm income, only to discover that American-raised carp taste muddy compared to those raised in Europe. Problem was, byt the time they'd discovered this, carp eggs were “in the wild,” spreading like a plague, displacing native fish populations and destroying the habitat of others. These two failures of ""scientific solutions"" are illustrative: many more exist. So needless to say, this skeptic won’t hold his breath. Like the antibiotic craze that’s created or current dysbiosis and given rise to higher-than-average allergies, asthmas and other autoimmune diseases, this “cure” will likely create a new dysbiosis. Flaws (and new-fangled tech gee-whiz) aside, I enjoyed Ed Yong’s I Contain Multitudes. I recommend it without reservation to fans of science books. The material is engaging, new and interesting. And very important. I was tempted to give it five stars, but something held me back. So I’m going with my four-star (and probiotic rich) gut in saying “four-stars.” . "
339,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"The first paragraph of the book's description perfectly describes it for me. Yong didn't just tell me how important my microbiome is, by the end of book, I felt it. There he really missed a perfect picture for me - that of Pigpen from the Peanuts strip by Charles Shultz. We aren't discrete beings making our lonely way through the world, but continually changing clouds of bacteria influencing & being influenced by our surroundings plant, animal, & mineral due to our incredible ecologies. That's not an overstatement & Yong gives plenty of examples throughout the book.We didn't evolve in a vacuum, bacteria have constantly drenched every living organism. Most don't have much to do with us, but many find a home within the newcomers, the more complex hosts, & they act like good house guests. Sometimes they move in to stay & provide services (symbiot). Occasionally they get out of line (disbiosis) & far more rarely they're bad. He gives fascinating examples of all states.He really shined with his descriptions of how one variety mosquitoes are altered to not carry disease. I've heard about such efforts, but never knew any of the methods. He'd mentioned & had given enough details about the bacterial strain Wolbachia that when he got around to telling how scientists were infecting mosquitoes that carried Dengue fever with it in an attempt to eradicate the disease, it made perfect sense & I'm not a scientist of any sort. IOW, his explanations were all good & accessible.His discussion of balances within the microbiotic community were especially interesting to me since both my wife & daughter have stomach issues. I had no idea how much or quickly such things could change. A mere change in diet of a day can completely change the balance of our gut bacteria while a course of antibiotics can be catastrophic. Of course, we have to balance the risks of destroying gut bacteria against dying of another infection that the antibiotic is being taken for. Often there isn't a definite or even a good answer, but a guess based on probabilities. It's messy & defies simplification so beware of miracle cures. In a few decades a doctor might be able to tailor a bacterial cocktail for your particular symptoms & biome, but the science is in its infancy. One of the places it is starting is with Fecal Matter Transfer (FMT). Gross, but it's been routinely carried out for those whose systems are in such distress that they're losing weight & wearing diapers. A colonoscopy that plants a donor's poop up their own intestines often fixes the problem, at least for a time. Now they're refining this to cultures that are contained in a capsule. yes, they give out a poo pill! Apparently our species' aversion to eating poo isn't exactly the norm in the animal kingdom. Rabbits & rats have to eat their own or else they get a vitamin deficiency. Other species regularly eat other's poo & it's one way beneficial bacteria spread & inoculate them. It can also lead to similar smells among them fostering a sense of community. Who knew? Fascinating!I was really surprised by the example of Sea World keeping the dolphin's water too clean. Anyone who has had an aquarium knows it takes a while to balance the system & clear up the water. It's not dirt, but the bio-balance, so it's often best to start a new tank by taking water from an existing aquarium. I never changed more than 1/3 of the water per week, a rule of thumb that was told to me early on by seemingly everyone. Ivory tower syndrome?While this is rather long & sagged a bit about 2/3-3/4 of the way through (at least I wandered a bit) I highly recommend reading it all the way through. The end is great & well worth the journey. My edition was well narrated & easily understood. I did get the ebook to refer to, but didn't have to very often - mostly just for the name & spelling of some terms & names.Highly recommended!"
340,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna,5,"This was a fascinating book. I’ve heard of gut microbiota and faecal microbiome transfer, but there was tons of new information. One of the most important concepts for me was that the microbiome is necessary for the normal development and functioning of higher organisms. One of the main targets for research is the gut:“The weird biology of germ-free animals is most obvious in the gut. A well-functioning gut needs a big surface area for absorbing nutrients, which is why its walls are densely lined with long, finger-like pillars. It needs to constantly regenerate the cells at its surface, which get sloughed off by the passing tide of food. It needs a rich network of underlying blood vessels to carry nutrients to and fro. And it needs to be sealed – its cells must stick tightly to each other to prevent foreign molecules (and microbes) from leaking into those blood vessels. All of these essential properties are compromised without microbes.If zebrafish or mice grow up in the absence of bacteria their guts don’t develop fully, (which) can be rectified simply by giving the animals a normal complement of microbes or even isolated microbial molecules. The bacteria don’t physically reshape the gut themselves. Instead, they work via their hosts...Lora Hooper demonstrated this by infusing into germ-free mice a common gut bacterium called Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron – or B-theta to its friends. She found that the microbe activated a wide range of mouse genes that are involved in absorbing nutrients, building an impermeable barrier, breaking down toxins, creating blood vessels, and creating mature cells.”The microbiome is also essential in the early development and the normal functioning of the mature immune system:… an animal’s genome doesn’t provide everything it needs to create a mature immune system. It also needs input from a microbiome. Hundreds of scientific papers, on species as diverse as mice, tsetse flies and zebrafish, have shown that microbes help to shape the immune system in some way. They influence the creation of entire classes of immune cells, and the development of organs that make and store those cells. They are especially important early in life, when the immunity machine is first constructed and tunes itself to the big, bad world. And once the machine is chugging away, microbes continue to calibrate its reactions to threats.I found it fascinating that breast milk doesn’t just contain antibodies to protect the infant, it also contains special oligosaccharides: „scientists have identified over 200 human milk oligosaccharides, or HMOs, so far” that the infant can’t digest. Breast-fed infants carry Bifidobacteria in their guts. “HMOs are not an all-purpose food for Bifs. [] the sugars selectively nourish one particular subspecies called Bifidobacterium longum infantis, or B. infantis for short. As long as you provide it with HMOs, it will outcompete any other gut bacterium.” [] As it digests HMOs, B. infantis releases short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that feed an infant’s gut cells – so while mothers nourish this microbe, the microbe in turn nourishes the baby. Through direct contact, B. infantis also encourages gut cells to make adhesive proteins that seal the gaps between them, and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system.”There are also chapters dealing with how microbes play a role in the life and death of coral reefs, symbionts in insects, how symbiosis is a precarious balance and only advantageous when the microbes are in the right place at the right time… I could go on, but you must read it yourself. I think it will be an engrossing read for anyone who is interested in science, symbiosis, evolution, ecology, hygiene…"
341,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1192324-ana,5,"This will be a difficult book to review, because I find myself short of words to express how good it is! Ed Yong is a science journalist and an amazing story teller. He masters the difficult art of delivering detailed and scientifically accurate information in an agreeable way, without scaring away the layman reader while satisfying someone with knowledge in the field as well. In fact, he manages to make it so interesting that I often found myself glued to the pages and sometimes reading parts of the text aloud to my daughters.Yong’s erudition is visible in many ways, including the several links he makes with literature, which begin right with the title of the book, a verse taken from a poem by Walt Whitman, ”Song to myself”.In the introduction, Yong describes a visit to a zoo with a microbiologist, to collect samples from a white-bellied pangolin – in his words, “an utterly endearing animal that looks like a cross between an anteater and a pine cone.” What starts like a novel, quickly gives way to an overview of the different types of microbes that live on, within and around every animal. We find ourselves amazed by the variety and ubiquity of these beings and we know we’re trapped: our curiosity has been stirred and we will not stop reading this book!The first chapter of the book is a summary of the evolution of life on Earth, framing the appearance of the human being in relation to other life forms, and especially single-cell ones:“All the visible organisms we’re familiar with, everything that springs to mind when we think of ‘nature’, are latecomers to life’s story. For most of the tale, microbes were the only living things on Earth” (more precisely, from March to October, in an imaginary calendar that we can use if we collapse the planet’s entire 4.54 billion years old history into one year, to make it manageable by our brains; in this calendar, humans have only existed for the last 30 min of December 31).The second chapter is a condensed historical overview of the “discovery” of microbes by man and the way knowledge and our general perception of this group has evolved. It finishes with a visit to a museum in the Netherlands dedicated to microscopic life, that I absolutely need to visit: Micropia (https://www.micropia.nl/en/)From here onwards, each chapter follows the work and the recent discoveries of scientists working in different parts of the world with different microbe groups and applications (ecology, agriculture, human health…). I am not making a summary or giving away any spoilers, but suffice to say that although I am not a complete layman in this field, I still found myself amazed and fascinated enough to ponder enrolling on a microbiology online course just to freshen up my long forgotten and outdated knowledge in this field.As far as I could find out, this was Ed Yong’s first book. I can’t wait to read his next one, although I am prepared to wait, as I am sure books like these take a very long time to write. This is very clear from the dozens of people he interviewed, laboratories he visited and publications he consulted. The book has around 70 pages of notes and bibliography, which I found myself constantly referring to.For those who are still thinking whether they should read this book, I am leaving a link to a talk given by Ed Yong himself about his book on the day it was published. I am sure he will convince you himself:https://edyong.me/i-contain-multitudes/"

So much so, that my Mom, a Bio and Chemistry teacher, had to keep them away from me so I would study other subjects.

Homo Sapiens often forget that we are relatively really late to this game called life, and that microbes have been around (and dominant) for much, much, much longer. It should then not be a surprise that all other life forms evolved with/around microbes. It's not news today that we are all covered (internally and externally) with trillions of microbes, but it's not often that we look at the world from the microbes point of view. This book explores the history, zoology, ecology, and biology of microbes and how they affect every single living thing on the planet in a myriad of ways. We often tend to focus on the bad guys - the pathogens - but that's like learning about terrorists, and assuming all that kind of people are terrorists. Not remotely true. I was educated, entertained, entranced, my mental maps where changed, and I will never look the world the same again. It was rather like a flat lander learning that the planet is not in fact flat. I do not exaggerate. The writing is really good, and covers a lot of ground in an easily digestible manner without dumbing things down. I appreciated the author's respect for the people on the front lines of the field, and the humor interspersed throughout. I loved every minute. I just learned the author covers science for The Atlantic, and I've added all his articles to my TBR list.Why might you care about microbes you ask? Well, from the book blurb: Many people think of microbes as germs to be eradicated, but those that live with us—the microbiome—build our bodies, protect our health, shape our identities, and grant us incredible abilities. You choose to remain ignorant at your own peril!"

Also gives a good argument for not trying to create hygenic, sterile, too-clean environments because they reduce our microbe populations and leave us vulnerable to invasion by bad things. As a slob, I feel vindicated. Highly readable, the best sort of popular science."
345,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,4,"This was an interesting book about the microbes inside us and around us and that are everywhere. This book goes into a lot of detail about the symbiosis between the microbes and other organisms, humans and animals. They are essential for life in all aspects, in digestion, our immune systems, and every other aspect of life. We would not be here today without them. It is also important to know that most microbes are not harmful. We have become so fixated on getting rid of them by too many antibiotics and too much antibacterial soaps and overly hygienic conditions that it is to our detriment. Antibiotics must be taken with care and only when necessary. Bacteria have been around forever and we have learned about them since Louis Pasteur and other microbiologists but with the new technologies of gene sequencing and genomics, it is now possible to sequence every gene and get a complete detail of every microbiome. With our understanding of evolution, we know that all life has co-evolved within close contact with microbes. And with our fast expanding knowledge of these microbes, we are learning how to eradicate diseases and learn how to live with them symbiotically.This book covers a very interesting array of topics about microbes in an understandable way and is for you if you are interested in microbiology."

A world that pre-existed the one of all more complicated life forms and that every other creature has had to accommodate to.I’m on day five of influenza and am sorely not up to writing the titillating review this book deserves. I am hoping my virus infection does not result in a bacterial infection that would need antibiotics. Bacteria evolve at a blistering speed by gene transfer, so resistance is almost instantaneous. Furthermore, a dose of antibiotics would put my gut microbes into havoc, possibly decimating the colonies I would like to keep and let more nasty ones settle. But no, you cannot treat a viral infection itself with antibiotics! Please! Our microbiomes aren’t inherently good or bad. There is no such thing as a good bug or a bad bug. Some play along the entire scale anyway. What has become clear is that our obsession with cleanliness is counterproductive, causing autoimmune diseases such as asthma. We need to train our immune systems to not be jittery and overreact.This book deserves to be read. It’s well told and entertaining, while being immensely informative."
348,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,4,"If you’re a physician, a nutritionist, or have studied biology, you’re probably aware that our bodies contain an immense number of microbes. Most of the rest of us find that surprising. Though I knew about the bugs that inhabit my digestive system, British science journalist Ed Yong helped me understand just how numerous and widely dispersed those microbes are on my body—and yours. Try 39 trillion. That number’s greater than the estimated number of human cells in our bodies. And it’s 100 times as great as the largest estimate of the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. In other words, it’s an understatement to say that the number of microbes we contain is astronomical.Should we fear the microbes within us?Now, before you panic about the many diseases you’ll contract from all these bugs, rest assured. “There are fewer than 100 species of bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans,” as Yong explains in I Contain Multitudes. “By contrast, the thousands of species in our guts are mostly harmless.” And a great many of them play indispensable roles in keeping us alive and disease-free. They bolster our immune system, digest our food, and even help make us who we are.How did this come about? “Remember that animals emerged in a world that had already been teeming with microbes for billions of years,” Yong notes. “They were the rulers of the planet long before we arrived. And when we did arrive, of course we evolved ways of interacting with the microbes around us.”The world within usThe collection of microbes in each of us is generally called the microbiome. Yong explains its functions and its fathomless diversity in conversational English with occasional flashes of humor. “Every one of us is a zoo in our own right,” he writes. “A colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collective. An entire world. . . Some species are common, but none is everywhere.” And that collection of species is unique to each of us. The microbes in my gut and on my skin are very different from those in and on you. Not only that but “your right hand shares just a sixth of its microbial species with your left hand.”The symbiosis spectrumThe theme of I Contain Multitudes is symbiosis. In common parlance, symbiosis suggests mutual benefit. Technically, though, the meaning is broader. “If one partner benefited at the expense of the other, it was a parasite (or a pathogen if it caused disease). If it benefited without affecting its host, it was a commensal. If it benefited its host, it was a mutualist. All these styles of coexistence fell under the rubric of symbiosis.” Yong’s book includes a huge number of examples, not just within our own bodies but in animals and plants as well. If you have an affinity for science, you’ll love this book.By the way, “there is no such thing as a ‘good microbe’ or a ‘bad microbe’ . . . In reality, bacteria exist along a continuum of lifestyles, between ‘bad’ parasites and ‘good’ mutualists. Some microbes . . . slide from one end of the parasite-mutualist spectrum to the other, depending on the strain, and on the host they find themselves in.” The possibilities of these combinations are endless.The ever-evolving field of biologyYong will take you on a tour of the laboratories where scientists study symbiosis and its effects on its many hosts in other living things. You’ll meet the pioneers in the field—a fascinating lot, few of whom match the stereotype of the frizzy-haired, absent-minded professor. You’ll learn about the emerging fields of biogeography, metagenomics, and synthetic biology. And you’ll see how the discoveries in these fields are benefiting medical science—and portend more advances in the future.The title of this engrossing book is from Walt Whitman: “I am large. I contain multitudes.”About the authorBorn Edmund Soon-Weng Yong in 1981, Ed Yong is a staff member of The Atlantic. He has degrees in zoology and biochemistry from England’s most celebrated centers of scientific teaching and research, the University of Cambridge and University College London. His popular blog has been incorporated into the National Geographic online."
349,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/563794-amy,5,"I originally encountered this book when ordering it for a class at the high school where I work. I have to think that if I had read this book in high school, my life would have taken a different trajectory. I find the world of bacteria and fungi to be ridiculously fascinating. Since I started reading this book, I’ve started reading microbiology textbooks and even joined a local mycology society. I’m not sure what I can do with all of this fascination at this point in my life, but here I am. I made 102 highlights in this book. Where in the world do I start? First of all, I think it’s important to clear up the misconception microbes are mainly disease-causing germs. Viruses cause diseases, but fewer than 100 bacteria actually cause diseases. So many of them work in symbiosis with the creatures that they inhabit making them healthier overall. Many have evolved with their hosts. Some of the more interesting ones discussed in the book are microbes that work inside insects to do things that the insects couldn't do on their own (such as the protozoa inside termites which help to digest wood). I could read an entire book on microbes inside insects and be happy. One of the more intriguing microbes that works in our favor is the bacteriophage. Bacteriophages in our mucus act as a line of defense against bacteria that try to enter our bodies through our mouths and nose. A bacteriophage injects its DNA into an invading bacteria and then replicates itself many times over inside the bacteria. Then all these new baby bacteriophages burst out of the bacteria in a spectacular act of bactericide. Something I’ve thought for years is that we’re hurting ourselves by living in cities, staying indoors, not interacting with farm animals, sanitizing everything, swimming in chlorinated pools, washing our hands too often and with anti-bacterial soaps, taking too many baths, being overly-cautious about refrigerating food, etc. We're robbing ourselves of the good bacteria that once colonized us. As a result, we have more allergies, more inflammatory diseases, etc. Of course, I say this, but I can’t stand for my hands to be dirty. But I do notice a huge difference moving to the city and spending more time indoors than outdoors in the woods. Last time I went back to visit relatives who live in the pine-filled South, I was sneezing at pine pollen that never bothered me before. I’ve been trying to spend more time in the woods, even going so far as to fall into mud puddles while trail running. It’s all part of the master plan of gaining more microbes. At least I’ll tell myself that. When we take antibiotics, we know that we’re eliminating helpful bacteria as well as the bad bacteria infecting us. As a result, we’ve been led to believe that eating yogurt or probiotics can help restore our gut microbiome. And we've heard about our gut microbiome affecting obesity. It is true that several studies have shown that it appears that gut bacteria can determine our propensity toward obesity. For example, normal-sized mice have 3000 times more Akkermansia muciniphila than obese mice. When obese mice eat this bacteria, they lose weight and are less likely to have type 2 diabetes. However, studies have shown that eating yogurt doesn’t really change the gut biome in the long term and probiotics really can only shorten diarrhea brought about by the infection or the antibiotics. Probiotics an also save premature infants from death by necrotising entercolitis. Otherwise, neither yogurt nor probiotics do much good in restoring what we’ve lost. However, it is possible to restore our gut health by acquiring the right microbes. But the way that we do this may sound a little gross because it’s by cacophagy (ingesting feces in pill form) or fecal transplants. I noticed my dog doing this for herself on a walk the other day and had to tell myself that it wasn't gross; she was just treating herself to a free ecosystem transplant. Fecal transplant studies have been found to cure up to 94% of participants of certain maladies which is statistically amazing. Fecal transplants have been used to treat everything from obesity to gut issues to mental health issues. I feel like I need to reread this book a few times to really get everything from it. There are just so many things that are interesting in the world of microbes. I know this book only scratches the surface, but it does so in a way that’s easily readable and understandable. Sometimes when I was reading this, I found myself far more intrigued to see where a study went than to find out what was happening next in my fiction book. Not all authors of scientific subjects can manage to do that."
350,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I picked this book up recently from Audible (because they had a sale and I'm weak.) ((After writing that I remembered that as part of that sale I received a $5 credit and then went to Audible to scope out their daily deal to see if I wanted to use it on that. I. AM. WEAK.)) (((By the way, it's Leviathan Wakes, which I already own, and absolutely recommend. $5.95 - can't beat that price for the audio!))) But anyway, I've been reading and listening to a LOT of nonfiction this year, and this was right up my alley, so of course I would pick it up if it was on sale. And man, was this fascinating. I have never been the type of person who worries overmuch about cleanliness to the point of sterility, and this book has kind of made me feel justified in that. I learned a lot - some that worries me for the future of my preemie, c-section born, and formula-fed nephew's future gut health (because he didn't get a boost of beneficial microbes that vaginally born and breastfed babies usually get from their mothers)... but a lot more that makes me hopeful for a lot of other conditions and illnesses and diseases that could be treated or prevented with the right microbial application. The hubs and I have been probiotic fans for a while (him more religiously than I) and so it was a little disappointing to learn that for the most part, this is useless and bunk because any microbes ingested this way don't actually stick around to become part of our biome, but rather pass through as any other food would. But it is a thought in the right direction for how we think about health, and how we think about microbes. Far from the ""all bacteria are bad!"" model, we should be thinking about them as organisms that can be beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. To a mouse, a cat is always bad news. To a human relying on that cat to rid them of mice, the cat is beneficial. Sometimes we're the mouse, and sometimes we're the human, but the cat is always just the cat. I was really interested to learn how microbes have facilitated evolution and development for many, many animals through symbiosis. This part of the book was very fascinating to me, because we usually tend to think of an organism as suited to its environment on its own, but that isn't always the case. For some animals, the right microbe at the right time is necessary to reach maturity, or to be able to eat and digest certain foods, etc. Really interesting. I didn't love the reader for this audiobook. He wasn't bad, but he would pause oddly in the middle of sentences sometimes (especially toward the end of the book) and it would throw me off thinking that he was done with the sentence, only to continue the thought. Otherwise, the only little nitpick I had was that sometimes the way he pronounced things threw me off. Aside from that, I thought he did a fine job, and I really enjoyed the book."
351,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"A Most Engrossing Exploration of the Microbial Organisms Which Lurk Within UsEchoing Charles Darwin's concluding paragraph in the first edition of Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" in its subtitle, noted science journalist Ed Yong's ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life"" is an exceptional, quite riveting, account explaining how bacteria and other microbes have played - and continue to play - important roles in shaping the course of the history of life on our planet. Yong offers us a compelling account of microbial ecology - especially the human microbiome - that can be seen as a worthy successor to David Quammen's masterful book on biogeography, ""The Song of The Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction"", Quammen's other notable works on evolutionary biology and Carl Zimmer's excellent books ranging from microbiology to evolutionary biology. While Yong does not explicitly refer to the coevolution of bacteria and other microbes within their plant and animal hosts, he does stress the importance of the mutualistic aspects of coevolution, noting as the main theme of his book, symbiosis between microbes and those other, much larger, organisms for which they are the ""multitudes"" within them.Yong takes readers on a compelling journey through space and time, noting some of the most important figures in the history of microbiology as well as introducing us to important contemporary microbiologists, and especially, microbial ecologists, such as University of Texas, Austin entomologist Nancy A. Moran, who is highly regarded for her research into the coevolution of aphids with their microbiomes, and most recently, honeybees with theirs. There are also especially noteworthy biographical overviews of Antony van Leeuwenhoek, the inventor of the microscope, and the first serious scientific investigator of the microbial world, Carl Woese, the American microbiologist who discovered the Archaea, Earth's oldest - and most ""primitive"" - organisms, and Lynn Margulies, the maverick American biologist who developed the credible scientific theory of endosymbiosis, explaining the origin of the eukaryotic cell found in plants and animals. He also explains how the once popular germ theory of disease promoted first by the likes of Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur in the 19th Century - which treated virtually all microbes as germs that had to be destroyed to prevent humanity from suffering from germ-borne diseases - is giving way to a far more nuanced view of the microbes residing within us, as willing partners and occasionally, antagonists, which have played notable roles in our evolutionary histories while we have also been influencing theirs across the vast gulf of time.Yong asks us to see ourselves as individual ""islands"", drawing upon the scientific metaphor of island biogeography popularized by David Quammen in his seminal book, ""The Song of the Dodo"" and the subject of much notable ecological research from the 1960s to the present. We are ""islands"" inhabited by microbial denizens. He emphasizes this repeatedly, introducing us to species as bizarre as a squid that relies on luminous bacteria for fostering its growth from juvenile larvae to adult, and parthenogenetic female parasitic wasps relying on microbes that prevent the occurrence of reproductively fertile male wasps. He shows how important microbes are in facilitating digestion of otherwise inedible food, like grasses in the stomachs of ruminant mammals such as cows, goats and sheep. In humans, he notes how differing modes of birth - natural vaginal versus Caesarean section - will leave newborn infants with different microbiomes, that may have an important impact on the health of new-born infants. He also shows how current microbiome research in evolutionary medicine and environmental science, represents some of the newest frontiers in contemporary medicine and science.Ed Yong is such a compellingly gifted storyteller and prose stylist that ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life"" will simultaneously surprise, delight, and entertain its readers. There is never a dull moment lurking in the pages of Yong's book; instead, readers will be mesmerized from its opening pages to its very last. If Charles Darwin read Ed Yong's ""I Contain Multitudes"", he might conclude that it offers readers a much grander view of life than what he envisioned when he wrote ""On the Origin of Species"". He might admit to possessing after reading it, both a substantial understanding and appreciation for the microbial life that he never thought of when he ended ""On the Origin of Species"" with these eloquent observations; ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved."""
352,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"I Contain Multitudes  is an enjoyable and informative book that takes a look at how microbes live, where microbes live and their interactions with other species, including humans. This book contains many interesting scientific findings and microbial interactions - such as worms that don't have a mouth and don't need to eat; parasitic wasps with antibiotic antennae goo; viruses inside bacteria inside a bug; bacteria that influence which bugs get to breed; the effects of your microbial ecosystem in sickness and in health; as well as a whole lot of other fascinating stuff.The author has a personable writing style without turning into a semi-biography. He manages to explain scientific concepts without simplifying them too much or bogging the reader down with technical terminology. The beginning of the book is a bit disjointed in terms of story telling, but then gets better as the author goes along. I do wish Ed Yong had included more details about some of the topics discussed, but that was probably out of the scope for a popular science book like this.Other Recommended Books about Microbes:- March of the Microbes: Sighting the Unseen by John L.

Here, the microbiomania was tempered by words of caution and foresight. For example, the lack of evidence that the lactic acid-producing bacteria survive the digestive track or even influence resident gut microbe communities, (most “probiotics” are mostly hype) while the bugs that HAVE shown clinical effects (e.g. in mice) should be wielded with much caution given that they are precisely more likely to establish themselves, and no organisms have only good or only bad effects. Even my favorite example of fecal transplants has really only been the miracle cure with C. diff infections, while the more complex IBD, obesity, and autism effects are clearly much more poorly understood. Still, there are amazing things on the horizon, and I love seeing that the actual reasearchers in the field are demonstrating that they have (finally) learned lessons from evolution and ecology and are trying to work with, rather than against, these forces. Balanced and rational arguments are so damned sexy."

Highly recommended."
360,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"If you’ve already read books like Martin Blaser’s Missing Microbes, a lot of this info won’t be new to you. However, Ed Yong’s enthusiasm and wider range — dipping into the microbes of other animals and even insects — is a joy. He also provides a counterpoint to some of Blaser’s more hysterical ideas about the loss of microbes. He agrees that microbes are important, and that our relationships with them are complex. But he doesn’t accept that we’re totally doomed. There’s tons of research into repopulating our guts with beneficial microbes, prebiotics and probiotics. No doubt things are in the pipeline which will make a difference.Yong is significantly less hopeful about the potential of procedures like faecal transplants — though the results have been encouraging in cases of C. difficile infections, the potential for treating inflammatory bowel disease seems more limited. It’s not impossible that a refined version of faecal transplants can help to rebalance the irritated and inflamed gut systems of people who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases… but so far, the data isn’t there.With his enthusiasm and interest, Yong makes me want to hurry the heck up, get my biology degree, and get stuck into researching on exactly these topics. One thing is for sure: our microbiome is incredibly important, and we need more research. Our gut microbes can affect our overall health in so many ways — mental health included — that I foresee a lot more time being spent on this in labs in the near future. And I hope I’ll be one of the people working in one of those labs.If you don’t know much about microbes, fear not: Yong’s writing is clear and accessible, with no technobabble. I think this book would be totally accessible to anyone with an interest.Originally reviewed on my blog."
361,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7206839-jenny,4,"My favorite parts of this book are when Ed Yong talks about the human microbiome. It's not that I don't want to learn about the bacteria on and in bugs and hyenas and such, but I read this book, hoping to learn more about how microbes affect humans, positively and/or negatively. I was hoping for more discussion of pathogens and illness. That's just where my fascination lies. Yong says in the Afterword that his goal in writing this book was to look at the microbiome as a whole and NOT focus on humans, so he did a great job of that. He makes it clear that bacteria are important to all life, not just to humans. Because, after all, there was life way before we humans were created, and there are many more non-human creatures than human ones on our planet. Besides, it's a more holistic view of life, a ""grander view,"" if you will, than we usually have. I recommend this book because it's eyeopening and educational. I learned a lot about microbes but also about life in general. It's funny and interesting. Yong has a unique voice, complete with corny jokes and wording, which makes this book about microbes accessible to anyone with an interest in the subject. My dad and I read this book together. From a quote in an early chapter until today, upon finishing, my dad kept bugging (pun intended) me about getting him a shirt that says, ""Microbe Lives Matter."" Maybe I'll just get him the shirt, so he'll stop pest-ering me. But, really. He wants a shirt that says that..."

Naturally, I will draw parallels.Ed Yong's goal in this book appears to be proving that our symbiosis with microbes is rooted in our origins, and while many commercial products might tell us otherwise, is absolutely necessary for our healthy lives. From the very first signs of life billions of years ago to modern day, microbes have essentially been dictating the rules by which complex beings evolve, absorb nutrients, battle toxins, and communicate with others. It is not always an easy coexistence, but like a pair of old roommates, we learn to feed off each other's best qualities.Read the rest of the review on: Chaika Books"

Though most cast microbes as antagonists, ""[t]here are fewer than 100 species of bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans""(11). Our microbes also supplement our body cells. It carries a whopping 500 times more genes than your cells. What your body cells cannot do, your microbes are most likely capable of.  We then dive into a crash course on microbiology's history. While looking through his microscope, the famous lens maker, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, found vast populations of microbes which he christened ""animalcules."" The field of microbiology made no significant advances until the nineteenth century, when Louis Pasteur proposed that microbes could be the agents of disease. Before then, disease was thought to be ""caused by bad air, or miasma, released from rotting matter""(32). Another breakthrough was seen when Joseph Lister introduced the use of antiseptic for medical purposes. The classification of microbes was enhanced by Carl Woese. In different bacterial samples, he found a common molecule called 16S rRNA. A discovery was made when Woese studied methanogens: ""when he looked at its 16S rRNA, he realized it was decidedly un-bacterial""(41). The methanogens were later reclassified as archaea. What marked this as a monumental step for biology in general was Woese's method of ""comparing genes to work out how species are related to each other""(41). This opened the path to metagenomics. Later scientist were able to ""extract the DNA from all local microbes, cut it into small fragments, and sequence them together""(43).  According to tests done on sterilized mice, ""microbes activated a wide range of mouse genes"" and ""told them how to use their own genes to make a healthy gut""(54). Microbes also ""stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cells, while others induce dove-like anti-inflammatory cells … they allow us to react to threats without overreacting""(64). Without this equilibrium, we would not be able to respond to harmful threats while overreacting to harmless one. Yong notes the irony of this. While many think of our immune system as a defense that destroys microbes, ""microbes craft and tune our immune system in the first place!""(64). When research showed that microbes affect the brain and behavior, scientists experimented on sterilized mice and ""by swapping the bacteria in the animal's guts … also swapped part of their personalities""(72). Microbes even release a chemical called dopamine, which inhibits satisfaction. By releasing dopamine when you eat certain foods, microbes can potentially hone your diet to benefit them. Sadly, our little friends can turn on us sometimes. Many viruses actually control the microbes in your body which have gone rogue. These are called microphages: ""When they touch down on a bacterium, they inject their DNA and turn the microbes into a factory for making more phages""(89). Our immune system helps us control our microbes: ""It's more about balance and good management than defence and destruction""(91).  Yong describes our immune system as an ""immunostat."" When relaxed, it can encourage invasions from outside microbes. When intensified, the immune system attacks harmless microbes and cause inflammation. With our modern sanitation, Yong claims that we have tuned our ""immunostats"" to be set toward the latter. This inadvertently induces problems such as allergies. The lack of fiber in modern diets also affect our intense ""immunostat."" When microbes break down bacteria, a chemical called short fatty acid (SCFA) is produced. These galvanize an increase in our anti-inflammatory cells. Fibers also encourage the colonization of helpful microbes with certain digestive enzymes. Our modern world has ""cut off routes by which microbes reach us, and then starve those that make it""(125). We then use the microbes' own weaponry, antibiotics, to kill both harmful and helpful microbes. Without a healthy microbiome, many pathogens can easily penetrate our body. But Yong does not suggest that antibiotics never be utilized; instead, he warns of their overuse which ""disrupts our microbiome and foments the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria""(128).  Microbes also utilize the special power of horizontal gene transfers (HGTs). All microbes are able to transmit genes to one another. There is a scary aspect to this. Microbes with mutations that allow them to be resistant to antibiotics can transfer its genes to other microbes, making them antibiotic-resistant. Yong describes this as ""one of the greatest public health threats of the twenty-first century""(192). But, as with all things, we can harness HGT for our benefit. Yong illustrates this through nori. Nori, which contains special carbohydrates, cannot be digested by regular enzymes. But marine Zobellia can digest it! When nori was eaten raw, Zobellia found on the nori was also eaten. As the Zobellia passed through the gut, it transferred its genes to other microbes. This is why many Japanese are able to digest nori. So hypothetically, if we need some benefit a microbe has, we just need it to pass through our body and allow it to carry out HGT.  Yong imagines an à la carte future , where scientists can equip microbes with specific genes. Scientists could program the microbes to eliminate certain harmful substances. This is the wonderful future of synthetic biology: Synthetic biologist aren't limited to sending microbes after pathogens. They might also train their creations to eliminate cancer cells or convert toxins into medicines. (239) In this book, Yong takes readers on a fascinating ride through the history and application of microbiology. It contains compelling anecdotes which are sprinkled with a topping of information. For readers interested in how microbes affect our lives, Ed Yong's I Contain Multitudes is the book to devour."
366,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23212031-james-foster,5,"There is a scientific revolution happening right now that is changing how we think about living things, including ourselves. The new realization is that the world is dominated by organisms too small to see. Put another way, large organisms like us are passengers, not drivers, despite our egotistical assumptions to the contrary. The subtitle of Yong’s new book, “the Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life,” exactly captures the thrill of these microbiome studies. A microbiome comprises the microscopic organisms associated with an organism or ecosystem. We are learning that the living things we can see are dominated by, and cannot exist without, their microbiomes We are also learning that microbiomes are far more complicated and ubiquitous than we ever imagined. Here are some examples. All oxygen on earth comes from bacteria—most of it directly from oceanic algae, but some from molecular devices in plants that have descended from bacteria that invaded the plant ancestors long ago. Bacteria exist everywhere we have looked—miles down in solid rock, in boiling water, deep in the black ocean, in NASA “clean rooms,” in “sterile” hospitals, in insects, plants, soil, air, and of course in and on your skin, teeth, guts, genitals, nasal cavities, etc. In fact, everywhere we have actually looked has bacteria, including healthy breast milk, amniotic fluid (probably), blood, semen, lungs, and more. Moreover, these microbiomes can have hundreds (as in human dentitia, milk, and vaginas) to thousands (as in mammalian guts) of different kinds of bacteria. You cannot survive in the real world without your bacteria. To give just one example, your bacteria produce essential amino acids that your body cannot synthesize or extract from what you eat. Other examples of our reliance on bacteria: they fix nitrogen for plants, digest grass for cattle and wood for termites, produce antibiotics, determine the sex of some insects, and more. Even cooler, in my opinion, is that we don’t know what most of these bacteria are, how they live, or what they do. We only know they are there. This means that every time we look, we are very likely to discover (many) new “species” of bacteria. It is as if every time we examine a tablespoon of dirt, a wall swab, or a breath of air, we make a major new discovery, far surpassing Darwin’s experiences on the Beagle.Yet we can only grow about 3% (estimated) of the bacteria we find. So, how do we know they are there? We take all the DNA in a sample (a skin swab, a bit of poop, some dirt, whatever), chop it up, sequence it, and put the sequences back together. This is new. Only in the last 15 years or so have we been able to sequence unknown DNA on very large scales. It used to be necessary to already know what part of a DNA molecule looked like, in order to design so-called “primers” to jump start the sequencing process. Moreover, we used to need to grow bacteria before we could get enough DNA to sequence. In both cases, this presumed we already knew quite a bit about what bacteria were present, so that discovery was very limited. Also, until recently, computers were not powerful enough to handle huge volumes of data, or to figure out which DNA fragments belonged together. Not so long ago, the accepted wisdom was that bacteria (and viruses, and microscopic fungi) were mostly bad, either giving us diseases, damaging our crops, or infecting our livestock. The assumption was that “bacteria” and “pathogen” were nearly synonymous. After all, we call our current theory of disease “the germ theory”. I remember once giving a talk about microbiomes at a public event in the Moscow Alehouse while people were enjoying their beer and burgers. Afterwards, a clearly upset patron approached me, complaining that he didn’t want to hear about nasty bacteria, especially in his gut, while he was eating. I was astonished. Didn’t he realize that the ex-cow he was eating wouldn’t exist without bacteria or that he couldn’t digest it without his own gut bacteria, let alone that the alcohol in his beer was essentially yeast excrement? We need to stop thinking about the microscopic world as the enemy, and instead think of ourselves (and our crops, livestock, homes, etc.) as partners with them. Hence Yong’s subtitle, “a Grander View of Life.”That bacteria dominate the world really shouldn’t be a surprise. They far out number us. A patch of your intestine the size of your thumbnail has more bacteria than all humans that have ever existed. It shouldn’t be a surprise that they can do so many things or that they live in so many places. They were the only living things on Earth for two billion year, almost half of Earth’s existence. We shouldn’t be surprised that the human body has 100 times more bacterial than human genes. Humans have only for about one five hundredth of one percent of the time that bacteria have. I think it is unfortunate that Yong didn’t go with the shorter and, I think, more accurate and interesting title that he mentions in passing, namely “I Am Multitudes.” This is a bacterial planet.Full disclosure: when I have on my scientist hat, this is what I do for a living. I study cool microbiomes, such as the skin microbiome of a highly toxic newt, the microbiome in breast milk, the microbiome of mud from the bottom of the ocean, the human vaginal microbiome, and the microbiome in the gut of premature infants with cystic fibrosis. As a computer scientist, most of what I do is develop new algorithms interpret DNA data, but I also sometimes work directly with the biology. I chose to do microbiome science because it is so very cool to be part of a scientific revolution, and because the people, such as those profiled in this book, are fascinating.I have intentionally not given any details about which microbiomes Yong discusses, nor what they do in their environments. I don’t want to spoil the discoveries for you. Suffice it to say that I Contain Multitudes captures the excitement and scope of this field. Read it. You will be infected, intellectually!"
367,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"Famously, according to Douglas Adams, The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (not the novel, the 'actual' guide) begin by telling you at length how big space is, but then 'After a while the style settles down a bit and it starts telling you things you actually need to know' - and the opening of Ed Yong's exploration of the microbiome, the complex world of bacterial life inside us and generally in living things and around the world, is rather reminiscent of this. In the first couple of chapters, we are fed fact after fact in a staccato collection of information that has no sense of narrative or flow, rather like a set of frenzied bullet points, which becomes wearing for the reader. For example there are two paragraphs in a row, one with practically all the sentences starting 'They', and the next with almost all beginning 'We'll'. Thankfully, though, like the HHGTTG, We Are Multitude then settles down and gets on with job in hand.It's a job that Ed Yong does very well. It's hardly news that we have many, many bacterial cells in us (though it does biologists no scientific favours when we discover the much used 'ten times as many as human cells' figure was just picked out of the air and has no scientific basis). However, Yong quickly takes us beyond that to explore the nuances of a very intricate relationship between bacteria and more complex life that could be summarised as 'Can't live with them, can't live without them.' Even many of our most hated bacterial foes can have positive roles at the right place and the right time.What certainly comes across is that our knee-jerk reaction of 'germs are bad' leads to an overemphasis on removing them, where actually they are often doing a useful job. When we go mad with our antibacterial cleansers, we are more like to wipe out good bacteria, leaving space for colonisation by nasties, than we are to simply kill off a threat. And Yong gives us a dramatic tour of the sheer variety of microbes and the environments in which different bacterial life can thrive, whether we talking black smokers or dolphin armpits.Every now and then, we get some excellent storytelling, but the use of example after example does give the impression to the non-biologist of the kind of approach that led Rutherford to comment that all science is either physics or stamp collecting - there is a fair amount of stamp collecting here. However, whenever the reader is beginning to feel that they are losing interest, up comes a really interesting part. I loved, for example, the story of the way that bacteria actually re-engineer the physical structure of a glow-in-the-dark squid. And it's hard not be impressed by the description of bacteria surveys being undertaken in a brand new hospital as it is brought into use, to see where the bugs come from. One of the particularly engaging observations is the emphasis on the benefits of open windows to allow bacteria to come in from the outside. Your mum's enthusiasm for getting you out in the fresh air was justified after all.If there's one message the reader comes away with, it's that we need to be more nuanced in our thinking about bacteria - sometimes, it seems almost to be a case of 'sit back and enjoy the ride, because whatever you do will probably mess things up.' You'll never look at a probiotic yogurt drink or a bottle of toilet cleaner the same again."
368,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,5,"A fantastic book covering an area that is the hot topic of the day in biology: the microbiome and how it affects us all. However, as the author shows, there is currently a lot of hype surrounding some aspects of the microbiome, like in probiotics and fecal transplants. This book will help readers to navigate the minefield of papers and articles about the microbiome and show you just what we know and, more importantly, what we still don't know about it and how it can affect our lives and the environment.Ed Yong starts with a look at how people like Leeuwenhoek discovered the world of bacteria and then goes on to show how microbes can interact with multi-celled organisms, like us, to form and grow them; for the fact is the genes and cells of animals (and probably plants) need the microbes to help mediate the growth of bodies. Experiments with sterile (germ-free) animals show they don't grow or develop well without the microbes.However, the microbes are not the selfless helpers of animals. Like any other organism, they also act in their self-interest and will grow and multiply uncontrollably inside animals (causing diseases) unless they are controlled by the body. This back-and-forth of conflict and cooperation is shown to occur not just in bodies but also in our environment. Numerous examples, from coral reefs that grow or die depending on which types of microbes are around, to malnutrition in children, are evidence of the action of different kinds of microbiomes.Now that we are starting to learn about microbiomes, what can we do about it. Here, the author covers the various experiments and studies that have been conducted or are being conducted to try to understand how various microbiomes work. He is also careful not to over-state the results of the studies for, in reality, we still know very little about the interactions of the microbes in the microbiomes and the changes we introduce may be for the better or worse.This book covers the very latest research into the microbiome; a look at the very long list of endnotes show some research where the results have yet to be published at the book's release. A definite must-read for those who want a glimpse of how microbes, despite their very small size, can affect our environment in surprising ways."
369,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,5,"Ed Yong may just be the best science writer currently working. In either case, this regular contributor to The Atlantic has written a brilliant book about the teeming microbial communities that live inside us, governing our health, illness, allergies and relationships with others.People who know about this topic generally have heard about it in terms of the somewhat offputting idea of fecal transplants, in which people with persistent C. difficile gut infections have been cured by giving them a sample of someone else's stool. It is a mark of how broad and incisive this book is that Yong doesn't get to the fecal transplant topic until the penultimate chapter.The rest of the book ranges far and wide through nature, from the scientist studying the microbiomes of zoo animals to the ones studying light emitting squids to those that are cataloging how microbial communities grow inside buildings ranging from hospitals to hotel rooms.Yong explains with literate craft how we have been hampered by a simplistic two-sided view of this hugely diverse microbial world. We either think of microbes as disease causing baddies that need to be vanquished, or as benign ""probiotic"" species that will turn us into healthy Birkenstock-wearing granola-crunching citizens. In fact, these microbial communities live in a tenuous and shifting balance with their hosts, whether they are mosquitoes, beewolf wasps or human beings, and if we aren't careful, tampering with these communities can cause more harm than good.Nevertheless, there are many exciting possibilities being explored by researchers for making our lives better, from breeding mosquitoes than are incapable of carrying the dengue or Zika viruses, to 3D-printed balls that will seed our hospital rooms with healthy microbes to specially designed microbial pills that can be dispensed to deal with an individual's particular ailment.We truly do contain multitudes, and this is one of the best, most gracefully written and cutting edge science books I've encountered."
370,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s,4,"All of us have an abundant microscopic menagerie, collectively known as the microbiota or microbiome. They live on our surface, inside our bodies, and sometimes inside our very cells. the vast majority of them are bacteria, but there are also other tiny organisms including fungi (such as yeasts) and archaea... There are viruses too, in unfathomable numbers...I've read some books recently about the microbiome. The Hidden Half of Nature: The Microbial Roots of Life and Health touched on it, but not satisfyingly enough. Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics Is Fueling Our Modern Plagues was really great, although almost a bit too evangelistic in his fervor for our resident bacteria and his ideas of how our mistreatment of it might be driving modern diseases. Ed Yong does a great job of toning that down a little and explaining how scientists believe our bodies became so dependent upon them for our health.Unfortunately, much of the book doesn't really talk about the human microbiome at all. He talks about pangolins and squid and aphids and termites and mealy bugs and... you get the (sometimes tedious) point. For me the strongest parts were where he discussed how our microbiome helps us to digest foods or how it protects us from sickness. Some points I got from the book were that human health is best with 1) natural childbirth, 2) breast-feeding, and 3) having pets in the home, especially dogs. And I absolutely loved his sense of humor - a little on the dry side, but right up my alley. So, while I was hoping for more emphasis on human health, it was still a very interesting book."
371,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5039223-ben-gutierrez,3,"For most of human history, microbes were invisible to us, though we sometimes saw their effects. After they were discovered, we paid most attention to the bacteria that caused disease or the bacteria that could fight disease.In recent decades, our attitude has shifted from fighting bacteria at every step, to understanding its vital role in the health of all living species. With the new view of bacteria, and our greater ability to understand it, we've begun to use it in ever subtler ways to improve the health of ourselves and other species.If you want a shorter read, try reading the first few chapters, which outline the history of our understanding of bacteria and will give you an idea of how amazing it is. Then, read the last two chapters: Microbes à la Carte and Tomorrow the World.The last two might be the most important, because almost all popular journalism about bacteria comes with all these promises of how bacteria will cure weight gain, how a new superbug is going to wipe out the entire human species, or how eating yogurt, kombucha, and sauerkraut is going to give you the bowel movements you've always dreamed of. At least, that's always my interpretation of these articles. The last portion of the book sheds more light on these ideas, and thereby tempers them. It's not that bacteria isn't dynamic cellular life in its rawest form that can do pretty much anything. It is and it can. But life is very complex and often does not have simple solutions."

I am glad it was my first book delving into the microbes and how they interact with life because it doesn't just focus on humans and our digestive tract. It does touch on it, but it covers so much more. How microbes interact in nature and with other animals, how our hospitals may actually be too clean and causing us harm, how probiotics you can buy may not be what you think they are (they are overly hyped), how microbes work in teams at times, how too much of a good thing is actually a bad thing. This book is great for an overview of the interactions of microbes with nature in general. It goes into a bit more detail on some of the subjects I mentioned above. I look forward to finding out more about the interactions in humans. "

The book takes us on a tour of the rapidly growing field of microbiology, demonstrating their crucial importance to species (including humans) and entire ecologies. Useful when thinking about the world and practically useful in living your life, not many science book can pull both off. Several themes I have came across before in the press or science blogs, even these capture the interest due to the quality of the writing. Bringing to life even the gross parts about fecal transplants (featuring an unfortunate blender!).Only minor quibble would be that even at a few years old large stride have already taken place that will of course not be present, that is most clear in the final chapter which feels a little threadbare compared to all of the others."

This book did not disappoint. I have been reading more and more in short news articles about the microbiome - the trillions of microbes that live within us. But this book gave the author the chance to explore the microbes of the world - from the deepest ocean, insects and animals, plant life and humans of course - and see how the multitudes of microbes at various times protect, destroy, change, adapt and interact with various hosts. It was fascinating to read about and I will look forward to finding out about new discoveries in this field."

This is a super accessible science book. I thought some of it was too niche or not interesting, but none of it was too difficult to understand. I also like his carefulness in examining the crazy claims of the ""probiotics"" evangelists. The book made me feel really lucky that I was able to birth my babies naturally and breastfeed them for a year each. Human milk is remarkable!"

To finish it and gush about what I have learned, recommend it to my loved ones, and hear similarly great reviews. Buckle up. This is not that review. I did not enjoy this book. In fact, there were several moments that this felt like a punishment. Many of the chapters felt convoluted and meandering. I gained some fun parcels of knowledge. I can better appreciate how the microbiotic world impacts all of evolution. Amazing. Thinking about medicine as gardening instead of warfare? Meaningful.

As an individual, you are not measured just by your mettle but by the mettle of your microbiome⁠—all the microbes collectively on and in your person. I Contain Multitudes boldly brings to your attention just how teeming the world and we are with invisible life.As some of the earliest forms of life on Earth, bacteria have developed diverse mechanisms and processes to survive on land, sea, and the most extreme environments. In the words of Yong, bacteria are ""metabolic wizards,"" now my new favorite way of describing how they can break down most anything: crude oil, plastics, plant material, you name it. In essence, if there's a way, you can bet there's a bacteria that has found it. Ed Yong's goal here is to dispel the overwhelming notion that bacteria are an evil to be eradicated, the infamous pathogens responsible for tuberculosis, cholera, tetanus, and the plague. Those bacteria are only a tiny drop in the bucket; there's a planet full of fascinating microbes that are harmless or, taking it a step further, essential for animal survival.The numerous examples which Yong provides of important symbiotic, or mutually beneficial, relationships between animal and bacteria demonstrate that such mutual coevolution simply cannot be ignored. Insects, squids, and yes, humans would find their immune defense and nutritional health wanting should the little microbes disappear. Mention about the scary Clostridium difficile, a bacteria that ravages the human gut when antibiotics clean out the healthy microbes within, hits close to home about the importance of recognizing the microbiome as a community, a vibrant ecosystem. There has only been a recent paradigm shift in recognizing both scientifically and medically that bacteria aren't solely organisms which ought to be nuked out of existence. On the flip side, that can lead to some overzealous claims about their benevolence (sorry, natural selection is still cranking away), but Yong is careful to point out when the data behind wild claims about bacterial miracles is just a little too shaky to trust. There's a lack of quantification for much of what Yong says, but I blame the state of the research field more than his skills as a science writer for a popular audience. He qualifies and admits the inherent weaknesses that a number of studies about the microbiome have; frankly, there is plenty of bad science out there. Instead, Yong chooses to look optimistically, to pique our attention towards the great potential for research results that are yet to be released. Though the information can become a little dense at times, Yong delivers a wide berth of information with easily digestible and dynamic language. At times, he writes with almost a childlike wonder at the biology, passionate about new discoveries and the future directions of research. Microbes are an undeniable part of each of us, and though Yong doesn't go full force towards heavy hitting questions about who we are, there is plenty of relevance to our lives and our worldview stocked in this book. Ultimately, I Contain Multitudes leaves us readers with our hopes raised for some incredible scientific advancements to be made with the proper lens—a lens zoomed into the microbes, that is."

Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes."" - Walt WhitmanI'm a priori inclined to like bacteria. My favorite is Oenococcus Oeni, even though that's not the only bacteria that causes the poorly-named malolactic fermentation during winemaking (malolactic conversion is better jargon, but I digress). No one really extols the virtues of super young red wine (I mean, besides those marketing masters in Beaujolais, but I'm firmly of the opinion that, if the terroir's worth tastin', skip the carbonic maceration). Straight out of the fermentation tank, red wine tastes like tart apples, which is not generally what you want. Introduce a little Oenococcus Oeni, and the apple taste softens up into butter. And I don't trust people who don't like butter.Northern California is apparently swarming with hippies, such as myself, who imagine that we're all interconnected cosmic beings embracing within a universal stew (or maybe cheese plate, we do a lot of wine and cheese up here, and I've been driving through redwoods for a few hours so it's a little hard for me to come up with a fitting metaphor). I Contain Multitudes is not only poetically written, but it deepens the feeling that we're all in this together. It's kind of like that episode of The Magic School Bus where the gang shrinks to the size of a blood cell and floats around the human body, but for educated grown ups who also listen to NPR. I recommend I Contain Multitudes, especially for people who want a more nuanced explanation of the hygiene hypothesis, fecal transplants, probiotics, and other bacteria-related stuff being reported in the news these days. Also recommended for stoners who want to think about the fact that we live in cities, but we also contain cities of bacteria, and the bacteria are floating in our bodies, and we're all fucking floating in space."
385,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5164471-geoffrey-benn,4,"“I Contain Multitudes,” is the first book by one of my favorite science journalists, Ed Yong. The focus of the book is microbiomes – the microbial ecosystems that exist on and in nearly every object on our planet (including us). Yong initially explores how scientific perceptions of the microbial world have changed from the first studies by Leeuwenhoek to the golden age of antibiotics to our microbiome-paper-a-day modern era and then jumps into ongoing microbiome research. The book is rich in excerpts from interviews with many leading scientists and covers a range of topics from the human microbiome to ecological consequences of altering microbial communities. As with Yong’s writing elsewhere, it is exciting and engaging while remaining rigorously factual and avoiding sensationalism. My one criticism is that the book lacked a strong over-arching narrative – it felt like I was jumping from one fascinating story to the next without a clear sense of direction. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in gaining a more nuanced understanding of the microbial world."

Ed Yong has captured a superb snapshot of a rapidly developing field. Microbes are not good or bad, as we used to be taught. They just are. Every animal, including us of course, is a dynamic ecosystem balancing countless species of bacteria plus viruses and other icky things. Microbes have evolved along with each other and animals in a balance that usually works best for everyone, because they were naturally selected to do so.Ed Yong writes so beautifully and naturally that you can gallop through this book with joy. His sly witticisms, stories, and elegant prose make a very complex subject understandable and consistently fascinating. And how refreshing it is to hear him say wee, poo, and squirting from its backside instead of pretending to be grown up with scientific Latinisms."

I know people don't often describe science books as beautiful, but this one is.The author presents an inclusive and harmonious picture of the complex universe of microorganisms. It was easy to see that he has a passion for the subject. His writing, at times, could be described as poetic. I can't pretend that I understood or will remember the majority of what he said but, it wasn't really that kind of book. This is a book that is meant to inspire the reader with a greater sense of wonder at the beauty and complexity of both our own bodies and of the world around us.I may just have to take a microbiology class at my local Jr College to gain a better understanding of the material this book covered."

They are utterly fascinating and we are just beginning to understand their role in our lives. Yong certainly knows his stuff. Most of this book was really interesting, with some pockets of 'deep knowledge' that I wasn't that intrigued about and lost me, but otherwise read up on microbes! #bookstagram #bookworm #icontainmultitudes"

This is likely a combination of a new-to-me topic and my own weak biology skills.So -- I'm (mostly) glad I read it, learned a few things, and glad to be done. 3.4 stars."
390,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"If you’ve already read books like Martin Blaser’s Missing Microbes, a lot of this info won’t be new to you. However, Ed Yong’s enthusiasm and wider range — dipping into the microbes of other animals and even insects — is a joy. He also provides a counterpoint to some of Blaser’s more hysterical ideas about the loss of microbes. He agrees that microbes are important, and that our relationships with them are complex. But he doesn’t accept that we’re totally doomed. There’s tons of research into repopulating our guts with beneficial microbes, prebiotics and probiotics. No doubt things are in the pipeline which will make a difference.Yong is significantly less hopeful about the potential of procedures like faecal transplants — though the results have been encouraging in cases of C. difficile infections, the potential for treating inflammatory bowel disease seems more limited. It’s not impossible that a refined version of faecal transplants can help to rebalance the irritated and inflamed gut systems of people who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases… but so far, the data isn’t there.With his enthusiasm and interest, Yong makes me want to hurry the heck up, get my biology degree, and get stuck into researching on exactly these topics. One thing is for sure: our microbiome is incredibly important, and we need more research. Our gut microbes can affect our overall health in so many ways — mental health included — that I foresee a lot more time being spent on this in labs in the near future. And I hope I’ll be one of the people working in one of those labs.If you don’t know much about microbes, fear not: Yong’s writing is clear and accessible, with no technobabble. I think this book would be totally accessible to anyone with an interest.Originally reviewed on my blog."
391,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7206839-jenny,4,"My favorite parts of this book are when Ed Yong talks about the human microbiome. It's not that I don't want to learn about the bacteria on and in bugs and hyenas and such, but I read this book, hoping to learn more about how microbes affect humans, positively and/or negatively. I was hoping for more discussion of pathogens and illness. That's just where my fascination lies. Yong says in the Afterword that his goal in writing this book was to look at the microbiome as a whole and NOT focus on humans, so he did a great job of that. He makes it clear that bacteria are important to all life, not just to humans. Because, after all, there was life way before we humans were created, and there are many more non-human creatures than human ones on our planet. Besides, it's a more holistic view of life, a ""grander view,"" if you will, than we usually have. I recommend this book because it's eyeopening and educational. I learned a lot about microbes but also about life in general. It's funny and interesting. Yong has a unique voice, complete with corny jokes and wording, which makes this book about microbes accessible to anyone with an interest in the subject. My dad and I read this book together. From a quote in an early chapter until today, upon finishing, my dad kept bugging (pun intended) me about getting him a shirt that says, ""Microbe Lives Matter."" Maybe I'll just get him the shirt, so he'll stop pest-ering me. But, really. He wants a shirt that says that..."

Naturally, I will draw parallels.Ed Yong's goal in this book appears to be proving that our symbiosis with microbes is rooted in our origins, and while many commercial products might tell us otherwise, is absolutely necessary for our healthy lives. From the very first signs of life billions of years ago to modern day, microbes have essentially been dictating the rules by which complex beings evolve, absorb nutrients, battle toxins, and communicate with others. It is not always an easy coexistence, but like a pair of old roommates, we learn to feed off each other's best qualities.Read the rest of the review on: Chaika Books"

I consider this a must read for anyone who thinks of bacteria as being evil 'germs'. Learning about the interactions and symbiosis of the little buggers is rationale enough for reading the book. I also really liked Yong's explanation of the gut brain microbiome connections, explained in an easy to grasp way without over-simplifying the controversies. "

395,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116660907-brian,5,"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life by Ed Yong dives into the wonderful and often misunderstood field of microbiology. Yong will unravel discoveries and knock down conspiracies — all while talking about microbes! Microbes will never be the same once you have read this book. The myriad microbes in our bodies are collectively known as the microbiome or microbiota. Microbes are a big part of our lives. According to Yong, our oxygen is produced by photosynthetic microbes in the ocean and the bacteria in chloroplasts (we would not be here without them!). Though most cast microbes as antagonists, ""[t]here are fewer than 100 species of bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans""(11). Our microbes also supplement our body cells. It carries a whopping 500 times more genes than your cells. What your body cells cannot do, your microbes are most likely capable of.  We then dive into a crash course on microbiology's history. While looking through his microscope, the famous lens maker, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, found vast populations of microbes which he christened ""animalcules."" The field of microbiology made no significant advances until the nineteenth century, when Louis Pasteur proposed that microbes could be the agents of disease. Before then, disease was thought to be ""caused by bad air, or miasma, released from rotting matter""(32). Another breakthrough was seen when Joseph Lister introduced the use of antiseptic for medical purposes. The classification of microbes was enhanced by Carl Woese. In different bacterial samples, he found a common molecule called 16S rRNA. A discovery was made when Woese studied methanogens: ""when he looked at its 16S rRNA, he realized it was decidedly un-bacterial""(41). The methanogens were later reclassified as archaea. What marked this as a monumental step for biology in general was Woese's method of ""comparing genes to work out how species are related to each other""(41). This opened the path to metagenomics. Later scientist were able to ""extract the DNA from all local microbes, cut it into small fragments, and sequence them together""(43).  According to tests done on sterilized mice, ""microbes activated a wide range of mouse genes"" and ""told them how to use their own genes to make a healthy gut""(54). Microbes also ""stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cells, while others induce dove-like anti-inflammatory cells … they allow us to react to threats without overreacting""(64). Without this equilibrium, we would not be able to respond to harmful threats while overreacting to harmless one. Yong notes the irony of this. While many think of our immune system as a defense that destroys microbes, ""microbes craft and tune our immune system in the first place!""(64). When research showed that microbes affect the brain and behavior, scientists experimented on sterilized mice and ""by swapping the bacteria in the animal's guts … also swapped part of their personalities""(72). Microbes even release a chemical called dopamine, which inhibits satisfaction. By releasing dopamine when you eat certain foods, microbes can potentially hone your diet to benefit them. Sadly, our little friends can turn on us sometimes. Many viruses actually control the microbes in your body which have gone rogue. These are called microphages: ""When they touch down on a bacterium, they inject their DNA and turn the microbes into a factory for making more phages""(89). Our immune system helps us control our microbes: ""It's more about balance and good management than defence and destruction""(91).  Yong describes our immune system as an ""immunostat."" When relaxed, it can encourage invasions from outside microbes. When intensified, the immune system attacks harmless microbes and cause inflammation. With our modern sanitation, Yong claims that we have tuned our ""immunostats"" to be set toward the latter. This inadvertently induces problems such as allergies. The lack of fiber in modern diets also affect our intense ""immunostat."" When microbes break down bacteria, a chemical called short fatty acid (SCFA) is produced. These galvanize an increase in our anti-inflammatory cells. Fibers also encourage the colonization of helpful microbes with certain digestive enzymes. Our modern world has ""cut off routes by which microbes reach us, and then starve those that make it""(125). We then use the microbes' own weaponry, antibiotics, to kill both harmful and helpful microbes. Without a healthy microbiome, many pathogens can easily penetrate our body. But Yong does not suggest that antibiotics never be utilized; instead, he warns of their overuse which ""disrupts our microbiome and foments the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria""(128).  Microbes also utilize the special power of horizontal gene transfers (HGTs). All microbes are able to transmit genes to one another. There is a scary aspect to this. Microbes with mutations that allow them to be resistant to antibiotics can transfer its genes to other microbes, making them antibiotic-resistant. Yong describes this as ""one of the greatest public health threats of the twenty-first century""(192). But, as with all things, we can harness HGT for our benefit. Yong illustrates this through nori. Nori, which contains special carbohydrates, cannot be digested by regular enzymes. But marine Zobellia can digest it! When nori was eaten raw, Zobellia found on the nori was also eaten. As the Zobellia passed through the gut, it transferred its genes to other microbes. This is why many Japanese are able to digest nori. So hypothetically, if we need some benefit a microbe has, we just need it to pass through our body and allow it to carry out HGT.  Yong imagines an à la carte future , where scientists can equip microbes with specific genes. Scientists could program the microbes to eliminate certain harmful substances. This is the wonderful future of synthetic biology: Synthetic biologist aren't limited to sending microbes after pathogens. They might also train their creations to eliminate cancer cells or convert toxins into medicines. (239) In this book, Yong takes readers on a fascinating ride through the history and application of microbiology. It contains compelling anecdotes which are sprinkled with a topping of information. For readers interested in how microbes affect our lives, Ed Yong's I Contain Multitudes is the book to devour."
396,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23212031-james-foster,5,"There is a scientific revolution happening right now that is changing how we think about living things, including ourselves. The new realization is that the world is dominated by organisms too small to see. Put another way, large organisms like us are passengers, not drivers, despite our egotistical assumptions to the contrary. The subtitle of Yong’s new book, “the Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life,” exactly captures the thrill of these microbiome studies. A microbiome comprises the microscopic organisms associated with an organism or ecosystem. We are learning that the living things we can see are dominated by, and cannot exist without, their microbiomes We are also learning that microbiomes are far more complicated and ubiquitous than we ever imagined. Here are some examples. All oxygen on earth comes from bacteria—most of it directly from oceanic algae, but some from molecular devices in plants that have descended from bacteria that invaded the plant ancestors long ago. Bacteria exist everywhere we have looked—miles down in solid rock, in boiling water, deep in the black ocean, in NASA “clean rooms,” in “sterile” hospitals, in insects, plants, soil, air, and of course in and on your skin, teeth, guts, genitals, nasal cavities, etc. In fact, everywhere we have actually looked has bacteria, including healthy breast milk, amniotic fluid (probably), blood, semen, lungs, and more. Moreover, these microbiomes can have hundreds (as in human dentitia, milk, and vaginas) to thousands (as in mammalian guts) of different kinds of bacteria. You cannot survive in the real world without your bacteria. To give just one example, your bacteria produce essential amino acids that your body cannot synthesize or extract from what you eat. Other examples of our reliance on bacteria: they fix nitrogen for plants, digest grass for cattle and wood for termites, produce antibiotics, determine the sex of some insects, and more. Even cooler, in my opinion, is that we don’t know what most of these bacteria are, how they live, or what they do. We only know they are there. This means that every time we look, we are very likely to discover (many) new “species” of bacteria. It is as if every time we examine a tablespoon of dirt, a wall swab, or a breath of air, we make a major new discovery, far surpassing Darwin’s experiences on the Beagle.Yet we can only grow about 3% (estimated) of the bacteria we find. So, how do we know they are there? We take all the DNA in a sample (a skin swab, a bit of poop, some dirt, whatever), chop it up, sequence it, and put the sequences back together. This is new. Only in the last 15 years or so have we been able to sequence unknown DNA on very large scales. It used to be necessary to already know what part of a DNA molecule looked like, in order to design so-called “primers” to jump start the sequencing process. Moreover, we used to need to grow bacteria before we could get enough DNA to sequence. In both cases, this presumed we already knew quite a bit about what bacteria were present, so that discovery was very limited. Also, until recently, computers were not powerful enough to handle huge volumes of data, or to figure out which DNA fragments belonged together. Not so long ago, the accepted wisdom was that bacteria (and viruses, and microscopic fungi) were mostly bad, either giving us diseases, damaging our crops, or infecting our livestock. The assumption was that “bacteria” and “pathogen” were nearly synonymous. After all, we call our current theory of disease “the germ theory”. I remember once giving a talk about microbiomes at a public event in the Moscow Alehouse while people were enjoying their beer and burgers. Afterwards, a clearly upset patron approached me, complaining that he didn’t want to hear about nasty bacteria, especially in his gut, while he was eating. I was astonished. Didn’t he realize that the ex-cow he was eating wouldn’t exist without bacteria or that he couldn’t digest it without his own gut bacteria, let alone that the alcohol in his beer was essentially yeast excrement? We need to stop thinking about the microscopic world as the enemy, and instead think of ourselves (and our crops, livestock, homes, etc.) as partners with them. Hence Yong’s subtitle, “a Grander View of Life.”That bacteria dominate the world really shouldn’t be a surprise. They far out number us. A patch of your intestine the size of your thumbnail has more bacteria than all humans that have ever existed. It shouldn’t be a surprise that they can do so many things or that they live in so many places. They were the only living things on Earth for two billion year, almost half of Earth’s existence. We shouldn’t be surprised that the human body has 100 times more bacterial than human genes. Humans have only for about one five hundredth of one percent of the time that bacteria have. I think it is unfortunate that Yong didn’t go with the shorter and, I think, more accurate and interesting title that he mentions in passing, namely “I Am Multitudes.” This is a bacterial planet.Full disclosure: when I have on my scientist hat, this is what I do for a living. I study cool microbiomes, such as the skin microbiome of a highly toxic newt, the microbiome in breast milk, the microbiome of mud from the bottom of the ocean, the human vaginal microbiome, and the microbiome in the gut of premature infants with cystic fibrosis. As a computer scientist, most of what I do is develop new algorithms interpret DNA data, but I also sometimes work directly with the biology. I chose to do microbiome science because it is so very cool to be part of a scientific revolution, and because the people, such as those profiled in this book, are fascinating.I have intentionally not given any details about which microbiomes Yong discusses, nor what they do in their environments. I don’t want to spoil the discoveries for you. Suffice it to say that I Contain Multitudes captures the excitement and scope of this field. Read it. You will be infected, intellectually!"
397,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"Famously, according to Douglas Adams, The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (not the novel, the 'actual' guide) begin by telling you at length how big space is, but then 'After a while the style settles down a bit and it starts telling you things you actually need to know' - and the opening of Ed Yong's exploration of the microbiome, the complex world of bacterial life inside us and generally in living things and around the world, is rather reminiscent of this. In the first couple of chapters, we are fed fact after fact in a staccato collection of information that has no sense of narrative or flow, rather like a set of frenzied bullet points, which becomes wearing for the reader. For example there are two paragraphs in a row, one with practically all the sentences starting 'They', and the next with almost all beginning 'We'll'. Thankfully, though, like the HHGTTG, We Are Multitude then settles down and gets on with job in hand.It's a job that Ed Yong does very well. It's hardly news that we have many, many bacterial cells in us (though it does biologists no scientific favours when we discover the much used 'ten times as many as human cells' figure was just picked out of the air and has no scientific basis). However, Yong quickly takes us beyond that to explore the nuances of a very intricate relationship between bacteria and more complex life that could be summarised as 'Can't live with them, can't live without them.' Even many of our most hated bacterial foes can have positive roles at the right place and the right time.What certainly comes across is that our knee-jerk reaction of 'germs are bad' leads to an overemphasis on removing them, where actually they are often doing a useful job. When we go mad with our antibacterial cleansers, we are more like to wipe out good bacteria, leaving space for colonisation by nasties, than we are to simply kill off a threat. And Yong gives us a dramatic tour of the sheer variety of microbes and the environments in which different bacterial life can thrive, whether we talking black smokers or dolphin armpits.Every now and then, we get some excellent storytelling, but the use of example after example does give the impression to the non-biologist of the kind of approach that led Rutherford to comment that all science is either physics or stamp collecting - there is a fair amount of stamp collecting here. However, whenever the reader is beginning to feel that they are losing interest, up comes a really interesting part. I loved, for example, the story of the way that bacteria actually re-engineer the physical structure of a glow-in-the-dark squid. And it's hard not be impressed by the description of bacteria surveys being undertaken in a brand new hospital as it is brought into use, to see where the bugs come from. One of the particularly engaging observations is the emphasis on the benefits of open windows to allow bacteria to come in from the outside. Your mum's enthusiasm for getting you out in the fresh air was justified after all.If there's one message the reader comes away with, it's that we need to be more nuanced in our thinking about bacteria - sometimes, it seems almost to be a case of 'sit back and enjoy the ride, because whatever you do will probably mess things up.' You'll never look at a probiotic yogurt drink or a bottle of toilet cleaner the same again."

However, as the author shows, there is currently a lot of hype surrounding some aspects of the microbiome, like in probiotics and fecal transplants. This book will help readers to navigate the minefield of papers and articles about the microbiome and show you just what we know and, more importantly, what we still don't know about it and how it can affect our lives and the environment.Ed Yong starts with a look at how people like Leeuwenhoek discovered the world of bacteria and then goes on to show how microbes can interact with multi-celled organisms, like us, to form and grow them; for the fact is the genes and cells of animals (and probably plants) need the microbes to help mediate the growth of bodies. Experiments with sterile (germ-free) animals show they don't grow or develop well without the microbes.However, the microbes are not the selfless helpers of animals. Like any other organism, they also act in their self-interest and will grow and multiply uncontrollably inside animals (causing diseases) unless they are controlled by the body. This back-and-forth of conflict and cooperation is shown to occur not just in bodies but also in our environment. Numerous examples, from coral reefs that grow or die depending on which types of microbes are around, to malnutrition in children, are evidence of the action of different kinds of microbiomes.Now that we are starting to learn about microbiomes, what can we do about it. Here, the author covers the various experiments and studies that have been conducted or are being conducted to try to understand how various microbiomes work. He is also careful not to over-state the results of the studies for, in reality, we still know very little about the interactions of the microbes in the microbiomes and the changes we introduce may be for the better or worse.This book covers the very latest research into the microbiome; a look at the very long list of endnotes show some research where the results have yet to be published at the book's release. A definite must-read for those who want a glimpse of how microbes, despite their very small size, can affect our environment in surprising ways."
399,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,5,"Ed Yong may just be the best science writer currently working. In either case, this regular contributor to The Atlantic has written a brilliant book about the teeming microbial communities that live inside us, governing our health, illness, allergies and relationships with others.People who know about this topic generally have heard about it in terms of the somewhat offputting idea of fecal transplants, in which people with persistent C. difficile gut infections have been cured by giving them a sample of someone else's stool. It is a mark of how broad and incisive this book is that Yong doesn't get to the fecal transplant topic until the penultimate chapter.The rest of the book ranges far and wide through nature, from the scientist studying the microbiomes of zoo animals to the ones studying light emitting squids to those that are cataloging how microbial communities grow inside buildings ranging from hospitals to hotel rooms.Yong explains with literate craft how we have been hampered by a simplistic two-sided view of this hugely diverse microbial world. We either think of microbes as disease causing baddies that need to be vanquished, or as benign ""probiotic"" species that will turn us into healthy Birkenstock-wearing granola-crunching citizens. In fact, these microbial communities live in a tenuous and shifting balance with their hosts, whether they are mosquitoes, beewolf wasps or human beings, and if we aren't careful, tampering with these communities can cause more harm than good.Nevertheless, there are many exciting possibilities being explored by researchers for making our lives better, from breeding mosquitoes than are incapable of carrying the dengue or Zika viruses, to 3D-printed balls that will seed our hospital rooms with healthy microbes to specially designed microbial pills that can be dispensed to deal with an individual's particular ailment.We truly do contain multitudes, and this is one of the best, most gracefully written and cutting edge science books I've encountered."

They live on our surface, inside our bodies, and sometimes inside our very cells. the vast majority of them are bacteria, but there are also other tiny organisms including fungi (such as yeasts) and archaea... There are viruses too, in unfathomable numbers...I've read some books recently about the microbiome. The Hidden Half of Nature: The Microbial Roots of Life and Health touched on it, but not satisfyingly enough. Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics Is Fueling Our Modern Plagues was really great, although almost a bit too evangelistic in his fervor for our resident bacteria and his ideas of how our mistreatment of it might be driving modern diseases. Ed Yong does a great job of toning that down a little and explaining how scientists believe our bodies became so dependent upon them for our health.Unfortunately, much of the book doesn't really talk about the human microbiome at all. He talks about pangolins and squid and aphids and termites and mealy bugs and... you get the (sometimes tedious) point. For me the strongest parts were where he discussed how our microbiome helps us to digest foods or how it protects us from sickness. Some points I got from the book were that human health is best with 1) natural childbirth, 2) breast-feeding, and 3) having pets in the home, especially dogs. And I absolutely loved his sense of humor - a little on the dry side, but right up my alley. So, while I was hoping for more emphasis on human health, it was still a very interesting book."
401,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5039223-ben-gutierrez,3,"For most of human history, microbes were invisible to us, though we sometimes saw their effects. After they were discovered, we paid most attention to the bacteria that caused disease or the bacteria that could fight disease.In recent decades, our attitude has shifted from fighting bacteria at every step, to understanding its vital role in the health of all living species. With the new view of bacteria, and our greater ability to understand it, we've begun to use it in ever subtler ways to improve the health of ourselves and other species.If you want a shorter read, try reading the first few chapters, which outline the history of our understanding of bacteria and will give you an idea of how amazing it is. Then, read the last two chapters: Microbes à la Carte and Tomorrow the World.The last two might be the most important, because almost all popular journalism about bacteria comes with all these promises of how bacteria will cure weight gain, how a new superbug is going to wipe out the entire human species, or how eating yogurt, kombucha, and sauerkraut is going to give you the bowel movements you've always dreamed of. At least, that's always my interpretation of these articles. The last portion of the book sheds more light on these ideas, and thereby tempers them. It's not that bacteria isn't dynamic cellular life in its rawest form that can do pretty much anything. It is and it can. But life is very complex and often does not have simple solutions."

It does touch on it, but it covers so much more. How microbes interact in nature and with other animals, how our hospitals may actually be too clean and causing us harm, how probiotics you can buy may not be what you think they are (they are overly hyped), how microbes work in teams at times, how too much of a good thing is actually a bad thing. This book is great for an overview of the interactions of microbes with nature in general. It goes into a bit more detail on some of the subjects I mentioned above. I look forward to finding out more about the interactions in humans. "

The book takes us on a tour of the rapidly growing field of microbiology, demonstrating their crucial importance to species (including humans) and entire ecologies. Useful when thinking about the world and practically useful in living your life, not many science book can pull both off. Several themes I have came across before in the press or science blogs, even these capture the interest due to the quality of the writing. Bringing to life even the gross parts about fecal transplants (featuring an unfortunate blender!).Only minor quibble would be that even at a few years old large stride have already taken place that will of course not be present, that is most clear in the final chapter which feels a little threadbare compared to all of the others."

This book did not disappoint. I have been reading more and more in short news articles about the microbiome - the trillions of microbes that live within us. But this book gave the author the chance to explore the microbes of the world - from the deepest ocean, insects and animals, plant life and humans of course - and see how the multitudes of microbes at various times protect, destroy, change, adapt and interact with various hosts. It was fascinating to read about and I will look forward to finding out about new discoveries in this field."
405,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"Fascinating insights--it won't be fire or ice that will take us down, it will be bacteria! They were here long before we were and will most certainly outlive us. That's actually not what he's saying at all, but sort of the message I took away from it. This is a super accessible science book. I thought some of it was too niche or not interesting, but none of it was too difficult to understand. I also like his carefulness in examining the crazy claims of the ""probiotics"" evangelists. The book made me feel really lucky that I was able to birth my babies naturally and breastfeed them for a year each. Human milk is remarkable!"

Microbes are opening up new avenues to deal with old problems ...... without chemicals. Who knew microbes would make for a great read.It is interesting to speculate the power of the microbe and how it can make the difference between sickness and health, death and life. "

Great anecdotes framed by a biographical sketch: meet a scientist, hear how they had a question and pursued the answer, etc. Wonderful descriptions of the lifecycle of different microbes, their impact on host organisms, and author's speculation on how the symbiosis began.But the author repeats this template over and over again. A magazine story repeated twenty times. All these wonderful details remained details."

Well, no, because Yong injects some humor into the narrative and keeps the pace snappy and fun.

To finish it and gush about what I have learned, recommend it to my loved ones, and hear similarly great reviews. Buckle up. This is not that review. I did not enjoy this book. In fact, there were several moments that this felt like a punishment. Many of the chapters felt convoluted and meandering. I gained some fun parcels of knowledge. I can better appreciate how the microbiotic world impacts all of evolution. Amazing. Thinking about medicine as gardening instead of warfare? Meaningful. But, these bits of knowledge do not outweigh the book overall."

As an individual, you are not measured just by your mettle but by the mettle of your microbiome⁠—all the microbes collectively on and in your person. I Contain Multitudes boldly brings to your attention just how teeming the world and we are with invisible life.As some of the earliest forms of life on Earth, bacteria have developed diverse mechanisms and processes to survive on land, sea, and the most extreme environments. In the words of Yong, bacteria are ""metabolic wizards,"" now my new favorite way of describing how they can break down most anything: crude oil, plastics, plant material, you name it. In essence, if there's a way, you can bet there's a bacteria that has found it. Ed Yong's goal here is to dispel the overwhelming notion that bacteria are an evil to be eradicated, the infamous pathogens responsible for tuberculosis, cholera, tetanus, and the plague. Those bacteria are only a tiny drop in the bucket; there's a planet full of fascinating microbes that are harmless or, taking it a step further, essential for animal survival.The numerous examples which Yong provides of important symbiotic, or mutually beneficial, relationships between animal and bacteria demonstrate that such mutual coevolution simply cannot be ignored. Insects, squids, and yes, humans would find their immune defense and nutritional health wanting should the little microbes disappear. Mention about the scary Clostridium difficile, a bacteria that ravages the human gut when antibiotics clean out the healthy microbes within, hits close to home about the importance of recognizing the microbiome as a community, a vibrant ecosystem. There has only been a recent paradigm shift in recognizing both scientifically and medically that bacteria aren't solely organisms which ought to be nuked out of existence. On the flip side, that can lead to some overzealous claims about their benevolence (sorry, natural selection is still cranking away), but Yong is careful to point out when the data behind wild claims about bacterial miracles is just a little too shaky to trust. There's a lack of quantification for much of what Yong says, but I blame the state of the research field more than his skills as a science writer for a popular audience. He qualifies and admits the inherent weaknesses that a number of studies about the microbiome have; frankly, there is plenty of bad science out there. Instead, Yong chooses to look optimistically, to pique our attention towards the great potential for research results that are yet to be released. Though the information can become a little dense at times, Yong delivers a wide berth of information with easily digestible and dynamic language. At times, he writes with almost a childlike wonder at the biology, passionate about new discoveries and the future directions of research. Microbes are an undeniable part of each of us, and though Yong doesn't go full force towards heavy hitting questions about who we are, there is plenty of relevance to our lives and our worldview stocked in this book. Ultimately, I Contain Multitudes leaves us readers with our hopes raised for some incredible scientific advancements to be made with the proper lens—a lens zoomed into the microbes, that is."

Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes."" - Walt WhitmanI'm a priori inclined to like bacteria. My favorite is Oenococcus Oeni, even though that's not the only bacteria that causes the poorly-named malolactic fermentation during winemaking (malolactic conversion is better jargon, but I digress). No one really extols the virtues of super young red wine (I mean, besides those marketing masters in Beaujolais, but I'm firmly of the opinion that, if the terroir's worth tastin', skip the carbonic maceration). Straight out of the fermentation tank, red wine tastes like tart apples, which is not generally what you want. Introduce a little Oenococcus Oeni, and the apple taste softens up into butter. And I don't trust people who don't like butter.Northern California is apparently swarming with hippies, such as myself, who imagine that we're all interconnected cosmic beings embracing within a universal stew (or maybe cheese plate, we do a lot of wine and cheese up here, and I've been driving through redwoods for a few hours so it's a little hard for me to come up with a fitting metaphor). I Contain Multitudes is not only poetically written, but it deepens the feeling that we're all in this together. It's kind of like that episode of The Magic School Bus where the gang shrinks to the size of a blood cell and floats around the human body, but for educated grown ups who also listen to NPR. I recommend I Contain Multitudes, especially for people who want a more nuanced explanation of the hygiene hypothesis, fecal transplants, probiotics, and other bacteria-related stuff being reported in the news these days. Also recommended for stoners who want to think about the fact that we live in cities, but we also contain cities of bacteria, and the bacteria are floating in our bodies, and we're all fucking floating in space."

The focus of the book is microbiomes – the microbial ecosystems that exist on and in nearly every object on our planet (including us). Yong initially explores how scientific perceptions of the microbial world have changed from the first studies by Leeuwenhoek to the golden age of antibiotics to our microbiome-paper-a-day modern era and then jumps into ongoing microbiome research. The book is rich in excerpts from interviews with many leading scientists and covers a range of topics from the human microbiome to ecological consequences of altering microbial communities. As with Yong’s writing elsewhere, it is exciting and engaging while remaining rigorously factual and avoiding sensationalism. My one criticism is that the book lacked a strong over-arching narrative – it felt like I was jumping from one fascinating story to the next without a clear sense of direction. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in gaining a more nuanced understanding of the microbial world."

Ed Yong has captured a superb snapshot of a rapidly developing field. Microbes are not good or bad, as we used to be taught. They just are. Every animal, including us of course, is a dynamic ecosystem balancing countless species of bacteria plus viruses and other icky things. Microbes have evolved along with each other and animals in a balance that usually works best for everyone, because they were naturally selected to do so.Ed Yong writes so beautifully and naturally that you can gallop through this book with joy. His sly witticisms, stories, and elegant prose make a very complex subject understandable and consistently fascinating. And how refreshing it is to hear him say wee, poo, and squirting from its backside instead of pretending to be grown up with scientific Latinisms."

It was easy to see that he has a passion for the subject. His writing, at times, could be described as poetic. I can't pretend that I understood or will remember the majority of what he said but, it wasn't really that kind of book. This is a book that is meant to inspire the reader with a greater sense of wonder at the beauty and complexity of both our own bodies and of the world around us.I may just have to take a microbiology class at my local Jr College to gain a better understanding of the material this book covered."

420,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"If you’ve already read books like Martin Blaser’s Missing Microbes, a lot of this info won’t be new to you. However, Ed Yong’s enthusiasm and wider range — dipping into the microbes of other animals and even insects — is a joy. He also provides a counterpoint to some of Blaser’s more hysterical ideas about the loss of microbes. He agrees that microbes are important, and that our relationships with them are complex. But he doesn’t accept that we’re totally doomed. There’s tons of research into repopulating our guts with beneficial microbes, prebiotics and probiotics. No doubt things are in the pipeline which will make a difference.Yong is significantly less hopeful about the potential of procedures like faecal transplants — though the results have been encouraging in cases of C. difficile infections, the potential for treating inflammatory bowel disease seems more limited. It’s not impossible that a refined version of faecal transplants can help to rebalance the irritated and inflamed gut systems of people who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases… but so far, the data isn’t there.With his enthusiasm and interest, Yong makes me want to hurry the heck up, get my biology degree, and get stuck into researching on exactly these topics. One thing is for sure: our microbiome is incredibly important, and we need more research. Our gut microbes can affect our overall health in so many ways — mental health included — that I foresee a lot more time being spent on this in labs in the near future. And I hope I’ll be one of the people working in one of those labs.If you don’t know much about microbes, fear not: Yong’s writing is clear and accessible, with no technobabble. I think this book would be totally accessible to anyone with an interest.Originally reviewed on my blog."
421,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7206839-jenny,4,"My favorite parts of this book are when Ed Yong talks about the human microbiome. It's not that I don't want to learn about the bacteria on and in bugs and hyenas and such, but I read this book, hoping to learn more about how microbes affect humans, positively and/or negatively. I was hoping for more discussion of pathogens and illness. That's just where my fascination lies. Yong says in the Afterword that his goal in writing this book was to look at the microbiome as a whole and NOT focus on humans, so he did a great job of that. He makes it clear that bacteria are important to all life, not just to humans. Because, after all, there was life way before we humans were created, and there are many more non-human creatures than human ones on our planet. Besides, it's a more holistic view of life, a ""grander view,"" if you will, than we usually have. I recommend this book because it's eyeopening and educational. I learned a lot about microbes but also about life in general. It's funny and interesting. Yong has a unique voice, complete with corny jokes and wording, which makes this book about microbes accessible to anyone with an interest in the subject. My dad and I read this book together. From a quote in an early chapter until today, upon finishing, my dad kept bugging (pun intended) me about getting him a shirt that says, ""Microbe Lives Matter."" Maybe I'll just get him the shirt, so he'll stop pest-ering me. But, really. He wants a shirt that says that..."

Naturally, I will draw parallels.Ed Yong's goal in this book appears to be proving that our symbiosis with microbes is rooted in our origins, and while many commercial products might tell us otherwise, is absolutely necessary for our healthy lives. From the very first signs of life billions of years ago to modern day, microbes have essentially been dictating the rules by which complex beings evolve, absorb nutrients, battle toxins, and communicate with others. It is not always an easy coexistence, but like a pair of old roommates, we learn to feed off each other's best qualities.Read the rest of the review on: Chaika Books"

I consider this a must read for anyone who thinks of bacteria as being evil 'germs'. Learning about the interactions and symbiosis of the little buggers is rationale enough for reading the book.

425,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116660907-brian,5,"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life by Ed Yong dives into the wonderful and often misunderstood field of microbiology. Yong will unravel discoveries and knock down conspiracies — all while talking about microbes! Microbes will never be the same once you have read this book. The myriad microbes in our bodies are collectively known as the microbiome or microbiota. Microbes are a big part of our lives. According to Yong, our oxygen is produced by photosynthetic microbes in the ocean and the bacteria in chloroplasts (we would not be here without them!). Though most cast microbes as antagonists, ""[t]here are fewer than 100 species of bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans""(11). Our microbes also supplement our body cells. It carries a whopping 500 times more genes than your cells. What your body cells cannot do, your microbes are most likely capable of.  We then dive into a crash course on microbiology's history. While looking through his microscope, the famous lens maker, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, found vast populations of microbes which he christened ""animalcules."" The field of microbiology made no significant advances until the nineteenth century, when Louis Pasteur proposed that microbes could be the agents of disease. Before then, disease was thought to be ""caused by bad air, or miasma, released from rotting matter""(32). Another breakthrough was seen when Joseph Lister introduced the use of antiseptic for medical purposes. The classification of microbes was enhanced by Carl Woese. In different bacterial samples, he found a common molecule called 16S rRNA. A discovery was made when Woese studied methanogens: ""when he looked at its 16S rRNA, he realized it was decidedly un-bacterial""(41). The methanogens were later reclassified as archaea. What marked this as a monumental step for biology in general was Woese's method of ""comparing genes to work out how species are related to each other""(41). This opened the path to metagenomics. Later scientist were able to ""extract the DNA from all local microbes, cut it into small fragments, and sequence them together""(43).  According to tests done on sterilized mice, ""microbes activated a wide range of mouse genes"" and ""told them how to use their own genes to make a healthy gut""(54). Microbes also ""stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cells, while others induce dove-like anti-inflammatory cells … they allow us to react to threats without overreacting""(64). Without this equilibrium, we would not be able to respond to harmful threats while overreacting to harmless one. Yong notes the irony of this. While many think of our immune system as a defense that destroys microbes, ""microbes craft and tune our immune system in the first place!""(64). When research showed that microbes affect the brain and behavior, scientists experimented on sterilized mice and ""by swapping the bacteria in the animal's guts … also swapped part of their personalities""(72). Microbes even release a chemical called dopamine, which inhibits satisfaction. By releasing dopamine when you eat certain foods, microbes can potentially hone your diet to benefit them. Sadly, our little friends can turn on us sometimes. Many viruses actually control the microbes in your body which have gone rogue. These are called microphages: ""When they touch down on a bacterium, they inject their DNA and turn the microbes into a factory for making more phages""(89). Our immune system helps us control our microbes: ""It's more about balance and good management than defence and destruction""(91).  Yong describes our immune system as an ""immunostat."" When relaxed, it can encourage invasions from outside microbes. When intensified, the immune system attacks harmless microbes and cause inflammation. With our modern sanitation, Yong claims that we have tuned our ""immunostats"" to be set toward the latter. This inadvertently induces problems such as allergies. The lack of fiber in modern diets also affect our intense ""immunostat."" When microbes break down bacteria, a chemical called short fatty acid (SCFA) is produced. These galvanize an increase in our anti-inflammatory cells. Fibers also encourage the colonization of helpful microbes with certain digestive enzymes. Our modern world has ""cut off routes by which microbes reach us, and then starve those that make it""(125). We then use the microbes' own weaponry, antibiotics, to kill both harmful and helpful microbes. Without a healthy microbiome, many pathogens can easily penetrate our body. But Yong does not suggest that antibiotics never be utilized; instead, he warns of their overuse which ""disrupts our microbiome and foments the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria""(128).  Microbes also utilize the special power of horizontal gene transfers (HGTs). All microbes are able to transmit genes to one another. There is a scary aspect to this. Microbes with mutations that allow them to be resistant to antibiotics can transfer its genes to other microbes, making them antibiotic-resistant. Yong describes this as ""one of the greatest public health threats of the twenty-first century""(192). But, as with all things, we can harness HGT for our benefit. Yong illustrates this through nori. Nori, which contains special carbohydrates, cannot be digested by regular enzymes. But marine Zobellia can digest it! When nori was eaten raw, Zobellia found on the nori was also eaten. As the Zobellia passed through the gut, it transferred its genes to other microbes. This is why many Japanese are able to digest nori. So hypothetically, if we need some benefit a microbe has, we just need it to pass through our body and allow it to carry out HGT.  Yong imagines an à la carte future , where scientists can equip microbes with specific genes. Scientists could program the microbes to eliminate certain harmful substances. This is the wonderful future of synthetic biology: Synthetic biologist aren't limited to sending microbes after pathogens. They might also train their creations to eliminate cancer cells or convert toxins into medicines. (239) In this book, Yong takes readers on a fascinating ride through the history and application of microbiology. It contains compelling anecdotes which are sprinkled with a topping of information. For readers interested in how microbes affect our lives, Ed Yong's I Contain Multitudes is the book to devour."
426,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23212031-james-foster,5,"There is a scientific revolution happening right now that is changing how we think about living things, including ourselves. The new realization is that the world is dominated by organisms too small to see. Put another way, large organisms like us are passengers, not drivers, despite our egotistical assumptions to the contrary. The subtitle of Yong’s new book, “the Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life,” exactly captures the thrill of these microbiome studies. A microbiome comprises the microscopic organisms associated with an organism or ecosystem. We are learning that the living things we can see are dominated by, and cannot exist without, their microbiomes We are also learning that microbiomes are far more complicated and ubiquitous than we ever imagined. Here are some examples. All oxygen on earth comes from bacteria—most of it directly from oceanic algae, but some from molecular devices in plants that have descended from bacteria that invaded the plant ancestors long ago. Bacteria exist everywhere we have looked—miles down in solid rock, in boiling water, deep in the black ocean, in NASA “clean rooms,” in “sterile” hospitals, in insects, plants, soil, air, and of course in and on your skin, teeth, guts, genitals, nasal cavities, etc. In fact, everywhere we have actually looked has bacteria, including healthy breast milk, amniotic fluid (probably), blood, semen, lungs, and more. Moreover, these microbiomes can have hundreds (as in human dentitia, milk, and vaginas) to thousands (as in mammalian guts) of different kinds of bacteria. You cannot survive in the real world without your bacteria. To give just one example, your bacteria produce essential amino acids that your body cannot synthesize or extract from what you eat. Other examples of our reliance on bacteria: they fix nitrogen for plants, digest grass for cattle and wood for termites, produce antibiotics, determine the sex of some insects, and more. Even cooler, in my opinion, is that we don’t know what most of these bacteria are, how they live, or what they do. We only know they are there. This means that every time we look, we are very likely to discover (many) new “species” of bacteria. It is as if every time we examine a tablespoon of dirt, a wall swab, or a breath of air, we make a major new discovery, far surpassing Darwin’s experiences on the Beagle.Yet we can only grow about 3% (estimated) of the bacteria we find. So, how do we know they are there? We take all the DNA in a sample (a skin swab, a bit of poop, some dirt, whatever), chop it up, sequence it, and put the sequences back together. This is new. Only in the last 15 years or so have we been able to sequence unknown DNA on very large scales. It used to be necessary to already know what part of a DNA molecule looked like, in order to design so-called “primers” to jump start the sequencing process. Moreover, we used to need to grow bacteria before we could get enough DNA to sequence. In both cases, this presumed we already knew quite a bit about what bacteria were present, so that discovery was very limited. Also, until recently, computers were not powerful enough to handle huge volumes of data, or to figure out which DNA fragments belonged together. Not so long ago, the accepted wisdom was that bacteria (and viruses, and microscopic fungi) were mostly bad, either giving us diseases, damaging our crops, or infecting our livestock. The assumption was that “bacteria” and “pathogen” were nearly synonymous. After all, we call our current theory of disease “the germ theory”. I remember once giving a talk about microbiomes at a public event in the Moscow Alehouse while people were enjoying their beer and burgers. Afterwards, a clearly upset patron approached me, complaining that he didn’t want to hear about nasty bacteria, especially in his gut, while he was eating. I was astonished. Didn’t he realize that the ex-cow he was eating wouldn’t exist without bacteria or that he couldn’t digest it without his own gut bacteria, let alone that the alcohol in his beer was essentially yeast excrement? We need to stop thinking about the microscopic world as the enemy, and instead think of ourselves (and our crops, livestock, homes, etc.) as partners with them. Hence Yong’s subtitle, “a Grander View of Life.”That bacteria dominate the world really shouldn’t be a surprise. They far out number us. A patch of your intestine the size of your thumbnail has more bacteria than all humans that have ever existed. It shouldn’t be a surprise that they can do so many things or that they live in so many places. They were the only living things on Earth for two billion year, almost half of Earth’s existence. We shouldn’t be surprised that the human body has 100 times more bacterial than human genes. Humans have only for about one five hundredth of one percent of the time that bacteria have. I think it is unfortunate that Yong didn’t go with the shorter and, I think, more accurate and interesting title that he mentions in passing, namely “I Am Multitudes.” This is a bacterial planet.Full disclosure: when I have on my scientist hat, this is what I do for a living. I study cool microbiomes, such as the skin microbiome of a highly toxic newt, the microbiome in breast milk, the microbiome of mud from the bottom of the ocean, the human vaginal microbiome, and the microbiome in the gut of premature infants with cystic fibrosis. As a computer scientist, most of what I do is develop new algorithms interpret DNA data, but I also sometimes work directly with the biology. I chose to do microbiome science because it is so very cool to be part of a scientific revolution, and because the people, such as those profiled in this book, are fascinating.I have intentionally not given any details about which microbiomes Yong discusses, nor what they do in their environments. I don’t want to spoil the discoveries for you. Suffice it to say that I Contain Multitudes captures the excitement and scope of this field. Read it. You will be infected, intellectually!"
427,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"Famously, according to Douglas Adams, The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (not the novel, the 'actual' guide) begin by telling you at length how big space is, but then 'After a while the style settles down a bit and it starts telling you things you actually need to know' - and the opening of Ed Yong's exploration of the microbiome, the complex world of bacterial life inside us and generally in living things and around the world, is rather reminiscent of this. In the first couple of chapters, we are fed fact after fact in a staccato collection of information that has no sense of narrative or flow, rather like a set of frenzied bullet points, which becomes wearing for the reader. For example there are two paragraphs in a row, one with practically all the sentences starting 'They', and the next with almost all beginning 'We'll'. Thankfully, though, like the HHGTTG, We Are Multitude then settles down and gets on with job in hand.It's a job that Ed Yong does very well. It's hardly news that we have many, many bacterial cells in us (though it does biologists no scientific favours when we discover the much used 'ten times as many as human cells' figure was just picked out of the air and has no scientific basis). However, Yong quickly takes us beyond that to explore the nuances of a very intricate relationship between bacteria and more complex life that could be summarised as 'Can't live with them, can't live without them.' Even many of our most hated bacterial foes can have positive roles at the right place and the right time.What certainly comes across is that our knee-jerk reaction of 'germs are bad' leads to an overemphasis on removing them, where actually they are often doing a useful job. When we go mad with our antibacterial cleansers, we are more like to wipe out good bacteria, leaving space for colonisation by nasties, than we are to simply kill off a threat. And Yong gives us a dramatic tour of the sheer variety of microbes and the environments in which different bacterial life can thrive, whether we talking black smokers or dolphin armpits.Every now and then, we get some excellent storytelling, but the use of example after example does give the impression to the non-biologist of the kind of approach that led Rutherford to comment that all science is either physics or stamp collecting - there is a fair amount of stamp collecting here. However, whenever the reader is beginning to feel that they are losing interest, up comes a really interesting part. I loved, for example, the story of the way that bacteria actually re-engineer the physical structure of a glow-in-the-dark squid. And it's hard not be impressed by the description of bacteria surveys being undertaken in a brand new hospital as it is brought into use, to see where the bugs come from. One of the particularly engaging observations is the emphasis on the benefits of open windows to allow bacteria to come in from the outside. Your mum's enthusiasm for getting you out in the fresh air was justified after all.If there's one message the reader comes away with, it's that we need to be more nuanced in our thinking about bacteria - sometimes, it seems almost to be a case of 'sit back and enjoy the ride, because whatever you do will probably mess things up.' You'll never look at a probiotic yogurt drink or a bottle of toilet cleaner the same again."

However, as the author shows, there is currently a lot of hype surrounding some aspects of the microbiome, like in probiotics and fecal transplants. This book will help readers to navigate the minefield of papers and articles about the microbiome and show you just what we know and, more importantly, what we still don't know about it and how it can affect our lives and the environment.Ed Yong starts with a look at how people like Leeuwenhoek discovered the world of bacteria and then goes on to show how microbes can interact with multi-celled organisms, like us, to form and grow them; for the fact is the genes and cells of animals (and probably plants) need the microbes to help mediate the growth of bodies. Experiments with sterile (germ-free) animals show they don't grow or develop well without the microbes.However, the microbes are not the selfless helpers of animals. Like any other organism, they also act in their self-interest and will grow and multiply uncontrollably inside animals (causing diseases) unless they are controlled by the body. This back-and-forth of conflict and cooperation is shown to occur not just in bodies but also in our environment. Numerous examples, from coral reefs that grow or die depending on which types of microbes are around, to malnutrition in children, are evidence of the action of different kinds of microbiomes.Now that we are starting to learn about microbiomes, what can we do about it. Here, the author covers the various experiments and studies that have been conducted or are being conducted to try to understand how various microbiomes work. He is also careful not to over-state the results of the studies for, in reality, we still know very little about the interactions of the microbes in the microbiomes and the changes we introduce may be for the better or worse.This book covers the very latest research into the microbiome; a look at the very long list of endnotes show some research where the results have yet to be published at the book's release. A definite must-read for those who want a glimpse of how microbes, despite their very small size, can affect our environment in surprising ways."
429,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,5,"Ed Yong may just be the best science writer currently working. In either case, this regular contributor to The Atlantic has written a brilliant book about the teeming microbial communities that live inside us, governing our health, illness, allergies and relationships with others.People who know about this topic generally have heard about it in terms of the somewhat offputting idea of fecal transplants, in which people with persistent C. difficile gut infections have been cured by giving them a sample of someone else's stool. It is a mark of how broad and incisive this book is that Yong doesn't get to the fecal transplant topic until the penultimate chapter.The rest of the book ranges far and wide through nature, from the scientist studying the microbiomes of zoo animals to the ones studying light emitting squids to those that are cataloging how microbial communities grow inside buildings ranging from hospitals to hotel rooms.Yong explains with literate craft how we have been hampered by a simplistic two-sided view of this hugely diverse microbial world. We either think of microbes as disease causing baddies that need to be vanquished, or as benign ""probiotic"" species that will turn us into healthy Birkenstock-wearing granola-crunching citizens. In fact, these microbial communities live in a tenuous and shifting balance with their hosts, whether they are mosquitoes, beewolf wasps or human beings, and if we aren't careful, tampering with these communities can cause more harm than good.Nevertheless, there are many exciting possibilities being explored by researchers for making our lives better, from breeding mosquitoes than are incapable of carrying the dengue or Zika viruses, to 3D-printed balls that will seed our hospital rooms with healthy microbes to specially designed microbial pills that can be dispensed to deal with an individual's particular ailment.We truly do contain multitudes, and this is one of the best, most gracefully written and cutting edge science books I've encountered."

They live on our surface, inside our bodies, and sometimes inside our very cells. the vast majority of them are bacteria, but there are also other tiny organisms including fungi (such as yeasts) and archaea... There are viruses too, in unfathomable numbers...I've read some books recently about the microbiome. The Hidden Half of Nature: The Microbial Roots of Life and Health touched on it, but not satisfyingly enough. Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics Is Fueling Our Modern Plagues was really great, although almost a bit too evangelistic in his fervor for our resident bacteria and his ideas of how our mistreatment of it might be driving modern diseases. Ed Yong does a great job of toning that down a little and explaining how scientists believe our bodies became so dependent upon them for our health.Unfortunately, much of the book doesn't really talk about the human microbiome at all. He talks about pangolins and squid and aphids and termites and mealy bugs and... you get the (sometimes tedious) point. For me the strongest parts were where he discussed how our microbiome helps us to digest foods or how it protects us from sickness. Some points I got from the book were that human health is best with 1) natural childbirth, 2) breast-feeding, and 3) having pets in the home, especially dogs. And I absolutely loved his sense of humor - a little on the dry side, but right up my alley. So, while I was hoping for more emphasis on human health, it was still a very interesting book."

After they were discovered, we paid most attention to the bacteria that caused disease or the bacteria that could fight disease.In recent decades, our attitude has shifted from fighting bacteria at every step, to understanding its vital role in the health of all living species. With the new view of bacteria, and our greater ability to understand it, we've begun to use it in ever subtler ways to improve the health of ourselves and other species.If you want a shorter read, try reading the first few chapters, which outline the history of our understanding of bacteria and will give you an idea of how amazing it is. Then, read the last two chapters: Microbes à la Carte and Tomorrow the World.The last two might be the most important, because almost all popular journalism about bacteria comes with all these promises of how bacteria will cure weight gain, how a new superbug is going to wipe out the entire human species, or how eating yogurt, kombucha, and sauerkraut is going to give you the bowel movements you've always dreamed of. At least, that's always my interpretation of these articles. The last portion of the book sheds more light on these ideas, and thereby tempers them. It's not that bacteria isn't dynamic cellular life in its rawest form that can do pretty much anything. It is and it can. But life is very complex and often does not have simple solutions."

I am glad it was my first book delving into the microbes and how they interact with life because it doesn't just focus on humans and our digestive tract. It does touch on it, but it covers so much more. How microbes interact in nature and with other animals, how our hospitals may actually be too clean and causing us harm, how probiotics you can buy may not be what you think they are (they are overly hyped), how microbes work in teams at times, how too much of a good thing is actually a bad thing. This book is great for an overview of the interactions of microbes with nature in general. It goes into a bit more detail on some of the subjects I mentioned above. I look forward to finding out more about the interactions in humans. "

Useful when thinking about the world and practically useful in living your life, not many science book can pull both off. Several themes I have came across before in the press or science blogs, even these capture the interest due to the quality of the writing. Bringing to life even the gross parts about fecal transplants (featuring an unfortunate blender!).Only minor quibble would be that even at a few years old large stride have already taken place that will of course not be present, that is most clear in the final chapter which feels a little threadbare compared to all of the others."

This book did not disappoint. I have been reading more and more in short news articles about the microbiome - the trillions of microbes that live within us. But this book gave the author the chance to explore the microbes of the world - from the deepest ocean, insects and animals, plant life and humans of course - and see how the multitudes of microbes at various times protect, destroy, change, adapt and interact with various hosts. It was fascinating to read about and I will look forward to finding out about new discoveries in this field."

This is a super accessible science book. I thought some of it was too niche or not interesting, but none of it was too difficult to understand. I also like his carefulness in examining the crazy claims of the ""probiotics"" evangelists.

In fact, there were several moments that this felt like a punishment. Many of the chapters felt convoluted and meandering. I gained some fun parcels of knowledge. I can better appreciate how the microbiotic world impacts all of evolution. Amazing. Thinking about medicine as gardening instead of warfare? Meaningful.

As an individual, you are not measured just by your mettle but by the mettle of your microbiome⁠—all the microbes collectively on and in your person. I Contain Multitudes boldly brings to your attention just how teeming the world and we are with invisible life.As some of the earliest forms of life on Earth, bacteria have developed diverse mechanisms and processes to survive on land, sea, and the most extreme environments. In the words of Yong, bacteria are ""metabolic wizards,"" now my new favorite way of describing how they can break down most anything: crude oil, plastics, plant material, you name it. In essence, if there's a way, you can bet there's a bacteria that has found it. Ed Yong's goal here is to dispel the overwhelming notion that bacteria are an evil to be eradicated, the infamous pathogens responsible for tuberculosis, cholera, tetanus, and the plague. Those bacteria are only a tiny drop in the bucket; there's a planet full of fascinating microbes that are harmless or, taking it a step further, essential for animal survival.The numerous examples which Yong provides of important symbiotic, or mutually beneficial, relationships between animal and bacteria demonstrate that such mutual coevolution simply cannot be ignored. Insects, squids, and yes, humans would find their immune defense and nutritional health wanting should the little microbes disappear. Mention about the scary Clostridium difficile, a bacteria that ravages the human gut when antibiotics clean out the healthy microbes within, hits close to home about the importance of recognizing the microbiome as a community, a vibrant ecosystem. There has only been a recent paradigm shift in recognizing both scientifically and medically that bacteria aren't solely organisms which ought to be nuked out of existence. On the flip side, that can lead to some overzealous claims about their benevolence (sorry, natural selection is still cranking away), but Yong is careful to point out when the data behind wild claims about bacterial miracles is just a little too shaky to trust. There's a lack of quantification for much of what Yong says, but I blame the state of the research field more than his skills as a science writer for a popular audience. He qualifies and admits the inherent weaknesses that a number of studies about the microbiome have; frankly, there is plenty of bad science out there. Instead, Yong chooses to look optimistically, to pique our attention towards the great potential for research results that are yet to be released. Though the information can become a little dense at times, Yong delivers a wide berth of information with easily digestible and dynamic language. At times, he writes with almost a childlike wonder at the biology, passionate about new discoveries and the future directions of research. Microbes are an undeniable part of each of us, and though Yong doesn't go full force towards heavy hitting questions about who we are, there is plenty of relevance to our lives and our worldview stocked in this book. Ultimately, I Contain Multitudes leaves us readers with our hopes raised for some incredible scientific advancements to be made with the proper lens—a lens zoomed into the microbes, that is."

Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes."" - Walt WhitmanI'm a priori inclined to like bacteria. My favorite is Oenococcus Oeni, even though that's not the only bacteria that causes the poorly-named malolactic fermentation during winemaking (malolactic conversion is better jargon, but I digress). No one really extols the virtues of super young red wine (I mean, besides those marketing masters in Beaujolais, but I'm firmly of the opinion that, if the terroir's worth tastin', skip the carbonic maceration). Straight out of the fermentation tank, red wine tastes like tart apples, which is not generally what you want. Introduce a little Oenococcus Oeni, and the apple taste softens up into butter. And I don't trust people who don't like butter.Northern California is apparently swarming with hippies, such as myself, who imagine that we're all interconnected cosmic beings embracing within a universal stew (or maybe cheese plate, we do a lot of wine and cheese up here, and I've been driving through redwoods for a few hours so it's a little hard for me to come up with a fitting metaphor). I Contain Multitudes is not only poetically written, but it deepens the feeling that we're all in this together. It's kind of like that episode of The Magic School Bus where the gang shrinks to the size of a blood cell and floats around the human body, but for educated grown ups who also listen to NPR. I recommend I Contain Multitudes, especially for people who want a more nuanced explanation of the hygiene hypothesis, fecal transplants, probiotics, and other bacteria-related stuff being reported in the news these days. Also recommended for stoners who want to think about the fact that we live in cities, but we also contain cities of bacteria, and the bacteria are floating in our bodies, and we're all fucking floating in space."

The focus of the book is microbiomes – the microbial ecosystems that exist on and in nearly every object on our planet (including us). Yong initially explores how scientific perceptions of the microbial world have changed from the first studies by Leeuwenhoek to the golden age of antibiotics to our microbiome-paper-a-day modern era and then jumps into ongoing microbiome research. The book is rich in excerpts from interviews with many leading scientists and covers a range of topics from the human microbiome to ecological consequences of altering microbial communities. As with Yong’s writing elsewhere, it is exciting and engaging while remaining rigorously factual and avoiding sensationalism. My one criticism is that the book lacked a strong over-arching narrative – it felt like I was jumping from one fascinating story to the next without a clear sense of direction. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in gaining a more nuanced understanding of the microbial world."

Ed Yong has captured a superb snapshot of a rapidly developing field. Microbes are not good or bad, as we used to be taught. They just are. Every animal, including us of course, is a dynamic ecosystem balancing countless species of bacteria plus viruses and other icky things. Microbes have evolved along with each other and animals in a balance that usually works best for everyone, because they were naturally selected to do so.Ed Yong writes so beautifully and naturally that you can gallop through this book with joy. His sly witticisms, stories, and elegant prose make a very complex subject understandable and consistently fascinating. And how refreshing it is to hear him say wee, poo, and squirting from its backside instead of pretending to be grown up with scientific Latinisms."

I can't pretend that I understood or will remember the majority of what he said but, it wasn't really that kind of book. This is a book that is meant to inspire the reader with a greater sense of wonder at the beauty and complexity of both our own bodies and of the world around us.I may just have to take a microbiology class at my local Jr College to gain a better understanding of the material this book covered."

450,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"If you’ve already read books like Martin Blaser’s Missing Microbes, a lot of this info won’t be new to you. However, Ed Yong’s enthusiasm and wider range — dipping into the microbes of other animals and even insects — is a joy. He also provides a counterpoint to some of Blaser’s more hysterical ideas about the loss of microbes. He agrees that microbes are important, and that our relationships with them are complex. But he doesn’t accept that we’re totally doomed. There’s tons of research into repopulating our guts with beneficial microbes, prebiotics and probiotics. No doubt things are in the pipeline which will make a difference.Yong is significantly less hopeful about the potential of procedures like faecal transplants — though the results have been encouraging in cases of C. difficile infections, the potential for treating inflammatory bowel disease seems more limited. It’s not impossible that a refined version of faecal transplants can help to rebalance the irritated and inflamed gut systems of people who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases… but so far, the data isn’t there.With his enthusiasm and interest, Yong makes me want to hurry the heck up, get my biology degree, and get stuck into researching on exactly these topics. One thing is for sure: our microbiome is incredibly important, and we need more research. Our gut microbes can affect our overall health in so many ways — mental health included — that I foresee a lot more time being spent on this in labs in the near future. And I hope I’ll be one of the people working in one of those labs.If you don’t know much about microbes, fear not: Yong’s writing is clear and accessible, with no technobabble.

It's not that I don't want to learn about the bacteria on and in bugs and hyenas and such, but I read this book, hoping to learn more about how microbes affect humans, positively and/or negatively. I was hoping for more discussion of pathogens and illness. That's just where my fascination lies. Yong says in the Afterword that his goal in writing this book was to look at the microbiome as a whole and NOT focus on humans, so he did a great job of that. He makes it clear that bacteria are important to all life, not just to humans. Because, after all, there was life way before we humans were created, and there are many more non-human creatures than human ones on our planet. Besides, it's a more holistic view of life, a ""grander view,"" if you will, than we usually have. I recommend this book because it's eyeopening and educational. I learned a lot about microbes but also about life in general. It's funny and interesting. Yong has a unique voice, complete with corny jokes and wording, which makes this book about microbes accessible to anyone with an interest in the subject. My dad and I read this book together. From a quote in an early chapter until today, upon finishing, my dad kept bugging (pun intended) me about getting him a shirt that says, ""Microbe Lives Matter.""

Naturally, I will draw parallels.Ed Yong's goal in this book appears to be proving that our symbiosis with microbes is rooted in our origins, and while many commercial products might tell us otherwise, is absolutely necessary for our healthy lives. From the very first signs of life billions of years ago to modern day, microbes have essentially been dictating the rules by which complex beings evolve, absorb nutrients, battle toxins, and communicate with others. It is not always an easy coexistence, but like a pair of old roommates, we learn to feed off each other's best qualities.Read the rest of the review on: Chaika Books"

Yong will unravel discoveries and knock down conspiracies — all while talking about microbes! Microbes will never be the same once you have read this book. The myriad microbes in our bodies are collectively known as the microbiome or microbiota. Microbes are a big part of our lives. According to Yong, our oxygen is produced by photosynthetic microbes in the ocean and the bacteria in chloroplasts (we would not be here without them!). Though most cast microbes as antagonists, ""[t]here are fewer than 100 species of bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans""(11). Our microbes also supplement our body cells. It carries a whopping 500 times more genes than your cells. What your body cells cannot do, your microbes are most likely capable of.  We then dive into a crash course on microbiology's history. While looking through his microscope, the famous lens maker, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, found vast populations of microbes which he christened ""animalcules."" The field of microbiology made no significant advances until the nineteenth century, when Louis Pasteur proposed that microbes could be the agents of disease. Before then, disease was thought to be ""caused by bad air, or miasma, released from rotting matter""(32). Another breakthrough was seen when Joseph Lister introduced the use of antiseptic for medical purposes. The classification of microbes was enhanced by Carl Woese. In different bacterial samples, he found a common molecule called 16S rRNA. A discovery was made when Woese studied methanogens: ""when he looked at its 16S rRNA, he realized it was decidedly un-bacterial""(41). The methanogens were later reclassified as archaea. What marked this as a monumental step for biology in general was Woese's method of ""comparing genes to work out how species are related to each other""(41). This opened the path to metagenomics. Later scientist were able to ""extract the DNA from all local microbes, cut it into small fragments, and sequence them together""(43).  According to tests done on sterilized mice, ""microbes activated a wide range of mouse genes"" and ""told them how to use their own genes to make a healthy gut""(54). Microbes also ""stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cells, while others induce dove-like anti-inflammatory cells … they allow us to react to threats without overreacting""(64). Without this equilibrium, we would not be able to respond to harmful threats while overreacting to harmless one. Yong notes the irony of this. While many think of our immune system as a defense that destroys microbes, ""microbes craft and tune our immune system in the first place!""(64). When research showed that microbes affect the brain and behavior, scientists experimented on sterilized mice and ""by swapping the bacteria in the animal's guts … also swapped part of their personalities""(72). Microbes even release a chemical called dopamine, which inhibits satisfaction. By releasing dopamine when you eat certain foods, microbes can potentially hone your diet to benefit them. Sadly, our little friends can turn on us sometimes. Many viruses actually control the microbes in your body which have gone rogue. These are called microphages: ""When they touch down on a bacterium, they inject their DNA and turn the microbes into a factory for making more phages""(89). Our immune system helps us control our microbes: ""It's more about balance and good management than defence and destruction""(91).  Yong describes our immune system as an ""immunostat."" When relaxed, it can encourage invasions from outside microbes. When intensified, the immune system attacks harmless microbes and cause inflammation. With our modern sanitation, Yong claims that we have tuned our ""immunostats"" to be set toward the latter. This inadvertently induces problems such as allergies. The lack of fiber in modern diets also affect our intense ""immunostat."" When microbes break down bacteria, a chemical called short fatty acid (SCFA) is produced. These galvanize an increase in our anti-inflammatory cells. Fibers also encourage the colonization of helpful microbes with certain digestive enzymes. Our modern world has ""cut off routes by which microbes reach us, and then starve those that make it""(125). We then use the microbes' own weaponry, antibiotics, to kill both harmful and helpful microbes. Without a healthy microbiome, many pathogens can easily penetrate our body. But Yong does not suggest that antibiotics never be utilized; instead, he warns of their overuse which ""disrupts our microbiome and foments the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria""(128).  Microbes also utilize the special power of horizontal gene transfers (HGTs). All microbes are able to transmit genes to one another. There is a scary aspect to this. Microbes with mutations that allow them to be resistant to antibiotics can transfer its genes to other microbes, making them antibiotic-resistant. Yong describes this as ""one of the greatest public health threats of the twenty-first century""(192). But, as with all things, we can harness HGT for our benefit. Yong illustrates this through nori. Nori, which contains special carbohydrates, cannot be digested by regular enzymes. But marine Zobellia can digest it! When nori was eaten raw, Zobellia found on the nori was also eaten. As the Zobellia passed through the gut, it transferred its genes to other microbes. This is why many Japanese are able to digest nori. So hypothetically, if we need some benefit a microbe has, we just need it to pass through our body and allow it to carry out HGT.  Yong imagines an à la carte future , where scientists can equip microbes with specific genes. Scientists could program the microbes to eliminate certain harmful substances. This is the wonderful future of synthetic biology: Synthetic biologist aren't limited to sending microbes after pathogens. They might also train their creations to eliminate cancer cells or convert toxins into medicines. (239) In this book, Yong takes readers on a fascinating ride through the history and application of microbiology. It contains compelling anecdotes which are sprinkled with a topping of information. For readers interested in how microbes affect our lives, Ed Yong's I Contain Multitudes is the book to devour."
456,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23212031-james-foster,5,"There is a scientific revolution happening right now that is changing how we think about living things, including ourselves. The new realization is that the world is dominated by organisms too small to see. Put another way, large organisms like us are passengers, not drivers, despite our egotistical assumptions to the contrary. The subtitle of Yong’s new book, “the Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life,” exactly captures the thrill of these microbiome studies. A microbiome comprises the microscopic organisms associated with an organism or ecosystem. We are learning that the living things we can see are dominated by, and cannot exist without, their microbiomes We are also learning that microbiomes are far more complicated and ubiquitous than we ever imagined. Here are some examples. All oxygen on earth comes from bacteria—most of it directly from oceanic algae, but some from molecular devices in plants that have descended from bacteria that invaded the plant ancestors long ago. Bacteria exist everywhere we have looked—miles down in solid rock, in boiling water, deep in the black ocean, in NASA “clean rooms,” in “sterile” hospitals, in insects, plants, soil, air, and of course in and on your skin, teeth, guts, genitals, nasal cavities, etc. In fact, everywhere we have actually looked has bacteria, including healthy breast milk, amniotic fluid (probably), blood, semen, lungs, and more. Moreover, these microbiomes can have hundreds (as in human dentitia, milk, and vaginas) to thousands (as in mammalian guts) of different kinds of bacteria. You cannot survive in the real world without your bacteria. To give just one example, your bacteria produce essential amino acids that your body cannot synthesize or extract from what you eat. Other examples of our reliance on bacteria: they fix nitrogen for plants, digest grass for cattle and wood for termites, produce antibiotics, determine the sex of some insects, and more. Even cooler, in my opinion, is that we don’t know what most of these bacteria are, how they live, or what they do. We only know they are there. This means that every time we look, we are very likely to discover (many) new “species” of bacteria. It is as if every time we examine a tablespoon of dirt, a wall swab, or a breath of air, we make a major new discovery, far surpassing Darwin’s experiences on the Beagle.Yet we can only grow about 3% (estimated) of the bacteria we find. So, how do we know they are there? We take all the DNA in a sample (a skin swab, a bit of poop, some dirt, whatever), chop it up, sequence it, and put the sequences back together. This is new. Only in the last 15 years or so have we been able to sequence unknown DNA on very large scales. It used to be necessary to already know what part of a DNA molecule looked like, in order to design so-called “primers” to jump start the sequencing process. Moreover, we used to need to grow bacteria before we could get enough DNA to sequence. In both cases, this presumed we already knew quite a bit about what bacteria were present, so that discovery was very limited. Also, until recently, computers were not powerful enough to handle huge volumes of data, or to figure out which DNA fragments belonged together. Not so long ago, the accepted wisdom was that bacteria (and viruses, and microscopic fungi) were mostly bad, either giving us diseases, damaging our crops, or infecting our livestock. The assumption was that “bacteria” and “pathogen” were nearly synonymous. After all, we call our current theory of disease “the germ theory”. I remember once giving a talk about microbiomes at a public event in the Moscow Alehouse while people were enjoying their beer and burgers. Afterwards, a clearly upset patron approached me, complaining that he didn’t want to hear about nasty bacteria, especially in his gut, while he was eating. I was astonished. Didn’t he realize that the ex-cow he was eating wouldn’t exist without bacteria or that he couldn’t digest it without his own gut bacteria, let alone that the alcohol in his beer was essentially yeast excrement? We need to stop thinking about the microscopic world as the enemy, and instead think of ourselves (and our crops, livestock, homes, etc.) as partners with them. Hence Yong’s subtitle, “a Grander View of Life.”That bacteria dominate the world really shouldn’t be a surprise. They far out number us. A patch of your intestine the size of your thumbnail has more bacteria than all humans that have ever existed. It shouldn’t be a surprise that they can do so many things or that they live in so many places. They were the only living things on Earth for two billion year, almost half of Earth’s existence. We shouldn’t be surprised that the human body has 100 times more bacterial than human genes. Humans have only for about one five hundredth of one percent of the time that bacteria have. I think it is unfortunate that Yong didn’t go with the shorter and, I think, more accurate and interesting title that he mentions in passing, namely “I Am Multitudes.” This is a bacterial planet.Full disclosure: when I have on my scientist hat, this is what I do for a living. I study cool microbiomes, such as the skin microbiome of a highly toxic newt, the microbiome in breast milk, the microbiome of mud from the bottom of the ocean, the human vaginal microbiome, and the microbiome in the gut of premature infants with cystic fibrosis. As a computer scientist, most of what I do is develop new algorithms interpret DNA data, but I also sometimes work directly with the biology. I chose to do microbiome science because it is so very cool to be part of a scientific revolution, and because the people, such as those profiled in this book, are fascinating.I have intentionally not given any details about which microbiomes Yong discusses, nor what they do in their environments. I don’t want to spoil the discoveries for you. Suffice it to say that I Contain Multitudes captures the excitement and scope of this field. Read it. You will be infected, intellectually!"
457,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"Famously, according to Douglas Adams, The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (not the novel, the 'actual' guide) begin by telling you at length how big space is, but then 'After a while the style settles down a bit and it starts telling you things you actually need to know' - and the opening of Ed Yong's exploration of the microbiome, the complex world of bacterial life inside us and generally in living things and around the world, is rather reminiscent of this. In the first couple of chapters, we are fed fact after fact in a staccato collection of information that has no sense of narrative or flow, rather like a set of frenzied bullet points, which becomes wearing for the reader. For example there are two paragraphs in a row, one with practically all the sentences starting 'They', and the next with almost all beginning 'We'll'. Thankfully, though, like the HHGTTG, We Are Multitude then settles down and gets on with job in hand.It's a job that Ed Yong does very well. It's hardly news that we have many, many bacterial cells in us (though it does biologists no scientific favours when we discover the much used 'ten times as many as human cells' figure was just picked out of the air and has no scientific basis). However, Yong quickly takes us beyond that to explore the nuances of a very intricate relationship between bacteria and more complex life that could be summarised as 'Can't live with them, can't live without them.' Even many of our most hated bacterial foes can have positive roles at the right place and the right time.What certainly comes across is that our knee-jerk reaction of 'germs are bad' leads to an overemphasis on removing them, where actually they are often doing a useful job. When we go mad with our antibacterial cleansers, we are more like to wipe out good bacteria, leaving space for colonisation by nasties, than we are to simply kill off a threat. And Yong gives us a dramatic tour of the sheer variety of microbes and the environments in which different bacterial life can thrive, whether we talking black smokers or dolphin armpits.Every now and then, we get some excellent storytelling, but the use of example after example does give the impression to the non-biologist of the kind of approach that led Rutherford to comment that all science is either physics or stamp collecting - there is a fair amount of stamp collecting here. However, whenever the reader is beginning to feel that they are losing interest, up comes a really interesting part. I loved, for example, the story of the way that bacteria actually re-engineer the physical structure of a glow-in-the-dark squid. And it's hard not be impressed by the description of bacteria surveys being undertaken in a brand new hospital as it is brought into use, to see where the bugs come from. One of the particularly engaging observations is the emphasis on the benefits of open windows to allow bacteria to come in from the outside. Your mum's enthusiasm for getting you out in the fresh air was justified after all.If there's one message the reader comes away with, it's that we need to be more nuanced in our thinking about bacteria - sometimes, it seems almost to be a case of 'sit back and enjoy the ride, because whatever you do will probably mess things up.' You'll never look at a probiotic yogurt drink or a bottle of toilet cleaner the same again."
458,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,5,"A fantastic book covering an area that is the hot topic of the day in biology: the microbiome and how it affects us all. However, as the author shows, there is currently a lot of hype surrounding some aspects of the microbiome, like in probiotics and fecal transplants. This book will help readers to navigate the minefield of papers and articles about the microbiome and show you just what we know and, more importantly, what we still don't know about it and how it can affect our lives and the environment.Ed Yong starts with a look at how people like Leeuwenhoek discovered the world of bacteria and then goes on to show how microbes can interact with multi-celled organisms, like us, to form and grow them; for the fact is the genes and cells of animals (and probably plants) need the microbes to help mediate the growth of bodies. Experiments with sterile (germ-free) animals show they don't grow or develop well without the microbes.However, the microbes are not the selfless helpers of animals. Like any other organism, they also act in their self-interest and will grow and multiply uncontrollably inside animals (causing diseases) unless they are controlled by the body. This back-and-forth of conflict and cooperation is shown to occur not just in bodies but also in our environment. Numerous examples, from coral reefs that grow or die depending on which types of microbes are around, to malnutrition in children, are evidence of the action of different kinds of microbiomes.Now that we are starting to learn about microbiomes, what can we do about it. Here, the author covers the various experiments and studies that have been conducted or are being conducted to try to understand how various microbiomes work. He is also careful not to over-state the results of the studies for, in reality, we still know very little about the interactions of the microbes in the microbiomes and the changes we introduce may be for the better or worse.This book covers the very latest research into the microbiome; a look at the very long list of endnotes show some research where the results have yet to be published at the book's release. A definite must-read for those who want a glimpse of how microbes, despite their very small size, can affect our environment in surprising ways."
459,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,5,"Ed Yong may just be the best science writer currently working. In either case, this regular contributor to The Atlantic has written a brilliant book about the teeming microbial communities that live inside us, governing our health, illness, allergies and relationships with others.People who know about this topic generally have heard about it in terms of the somewhat offputting idea of fecal transplants, in which people with persistent C. difficile gut infections have been cured by giving them a sample of someone else's stool. It is a mark of how broad and incisive this book is that Yong doesn't get to the fecal transplant topic until the penultimate chapter.The rest of the book ranges far and wide through nature, from the scientist studying the microbiomes of zoo animals to the ones studying light emitting squids to those that are cataloging how microbial communities grow inside buildings ranging from hospitals to hotel rooms.Yong explains with literate craft how we have been hampered by a simplistic two-sided view of this hugely diverse microbial world. We either think of microbes as disease causing baddies that need to be vanquished, or as benign ""probiotic"" species that will turn us into healthy Birkenstock-wearing granola-crunching citizens. In fact, these microbial communities live in a tenuous and shifting balance with their hosts, whether they are mosquitoes, beewolf wasps or human beings, and if we aren't careful, tampering with these communities can cause more harm than good.Nevertheless, there are many exciting possibilities being explored by researchers for making our lives better, from breeding mosquitoes than are incapable of carrying the dengue or Zika viruses, to 3D-printed balls that will seed our hospital rooms with healthy microbes to specially designed microbial pills that can be dispensed to deal with an individual's particular ailment.We truly do contain multitudes, and this is one of the best, most gracefully written and cutting edge science books I've encountered."
460,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s,4,"All of us have an abundant microscopic menagerie, collectively known as the microbiota or microbiome. They live on our surface, inside our bodies, and sometimes inside our very cells. the vast majority of them are bacteria, but there are also other tiny organisms including fungi (such as yeasts) and archaea... There are viruses too, in unfathomable numbers...I've read some books recently about the microbiome. The Hidden Half of Nature: The Microbial Roots of Life and Health touched on it, but not satisfyingly enough. Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics Is Fueling Our Modern Plagues was really great, although almost a bit too evangelistic in his fervor for our resident bacteria and his ideas of how our mistreatment of it might be driving modern diseases. Ed Yong does a great job of toning that down a little and explaining how scientists believe our bodies became so dependent upon them for our health.Unfortunately, much of the book doesn't really talk about the human microbiome at all. He talks about pangolins and squid and aphids and termites and mealy bugs and... you get the (sometimes tedious) point. For me the strongest parts were where he discussed how our microbiome helps us to digest foods or how it protects us from sickness. Some points I got from the book were that human health is best with 1) natural childbirth, 2) breast-feeding, and 3) having pets in the home, especially dogs. And I absolutely loved his sense of humor - a little on the dry side, but right up my alley. So, while I was hoping for more emphasis on human health, it was still a very interesting book."
461,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5039223-ben-gutierrez,3,"For most of human history, microbes were invisible to us, though we sometimes saw their effects. After they were discovered, we paid most attention to the bacteria that caused disease or the bacteria that could fight disease.In recent decades, our attitude has shifted from fighting bacteria at every step, to understanding its vital role in the health of all living species. With the new view of bacteria, and our greater ability to understand it, we've begun to use it in ever subtler ways to improve the health of ourselves and other species.If you want a shorter read, try reading the first few chapters, which outline the history of our understanding of bacteria and will give you an idea of how amazing it is. Then, read the last two chapters: Microbes à la Carte and Tomorrow the World.The last two might be the most important, because almost all popular journalism about bacteria comes with all these promises of how bacteria will cure weight gain, how a new superbug is going to wipe out the entire human species, or how eating yogurt, kombucha, and sauerkraut is going to give you the bowel movements you've always dreamed of. At least, that's always my interpretation of these articles. The last portion of the book sheds more light on these ideas, and thereby tempers them. It's not that bacteria isn't dynamic cellular life in its rawest form that can do pretty much anything. It is and it can. But life is very complex and often does not have simple solutions."

I am glad it was my first book delving into the microbes and how they interact with life because it doesn't just focus on humans and our digestive tract. It does touch on it, but it covers so much more. How microbes interact in nature and with other animals, how our hospitals may actually be too clean and causing us harm, how probiotics you can buy may not be what you think they are (they are overly hyped), how microbes work in teams at times, how too much of a good thing is actually a bad thing. This book is great for an overview of the interactions of microbes with nature in general. It goes into a bit more detail on some of the subjects I mentioned above. I look forward to finding out more about the interactions in humans. "

The book takes us on a tour of the rapidly growing field of microbiology, demonstrating their crucial importance to species (including humans) and entire ecologies. Useful when thinking about the world and practically useful in living your life, not many science book can pull both off. Several themes I have came across before in the press or science blogs, even these capture the interest due to the quality of the writing. Bringing to life even the gross parts about fecal transplants (featuring an unfortunate blender!).Only minor quibble would be that even at a few years old large stride have already taken place that will of course not be present, that is most clear in the final chapter which feels a little threadbare compared to all of the others."

This book did not disappoint. I have been reading more and more in short news articles about the microbiome - the trillions of microbes that live within us. But this book gave the author the chance to explore the microbes of the world - from the deepest ocean, insects and animals, plant life and humans of course - and see how the multitudes of microbes at various times protect, destroy, change, adapt and interact with various hosts. It was fascinating to read about and I will look forward to finding out about new discoveries in this field."

They were here long before we were and will most certainly outlive us. That's actually not what he's saying at all, but sort of the message I took away from it. This is a super accessible science book. I thought some of it was too niche or not interesting, but none of it was too difficult to understand. I also like his carefulness in examining the crazy claims of the ""probiotics"" evangelists. The book made me feel really lucky that I was able to birth my babies naturally and breastfeed them for a year each. Human milk is remarkable!"

Who knew microbes would make for a great read.It is interesting to speculate the power of the microbe and how it can make the difference between sickness and health, death and life. "

To finish it and gush about what I have learned, recommend it to my loved ones, and hear similarly great reviews. Buckle up. This is not that review. I did not enjoy this book. In fact, there were several moments that this felt like a punishment. Many of the chapters felt convoluted and meandering. I gained some fun parcels of knowledge. I can better appreciate how the microbiotic world impacts all of evolution. Amazing. Thinking about medicine as gardening instead of warfare? Meaningful.

As an individual, you are not measured just by your mettle but by the mettle of your microbiome⁠—all the microbes collectively on and in your person. I Contain Multitudes boldly brings to your attention just how teeming the world and we are with invisible life.As some of the earliest forms of life on Earth, bacteria have developed diverse mechanisms and processes to survive on land, sea, and the most extreme environments. In the words of Yong, bacteria are ""metabolic wizards,"" now my new favorite way of describing how they can break down most anything: crude oil, plastics, plant material, you name it. In essence, if there's a way, you can bet there's a bacteria that has found it. Ed Yong's goal here is to dispel the overwhelming notion that bacteria are an evil to be eradicated, the infamous pathogens responsible for tuberculosis, cholera, tetanus, and the plague. Those bacteria are only a tiny drop in the bucket; there's a planet full of fascinating microbes that are harmless or, taking it a step further, essential for animal survival.The numerous examples which Yong provides of important symbiotic, or mutually beneficial, relationships between animal and bacteria demonstrate that such mutual coevolution simply cannot be ignored. Insects, squids, and yes, humans would find their immune defense and nutritional health wanting should the little microbes disappear. Mention about the scary Clostridium difficile, a bacteria that ravages the human gut when antibiotics clean out the healthy microbes within, hits close to home about the importance of recognizing the microbiome as a community, a vibrant ecosystem. There has only been a recent paradigm shift in recognizing both scientifically and medically that bacteria aren't solely organisms which ought to be nuked out of existence. On the flip side, that can lead to some overzealous claims about their benevolence (sorry, natural selection is still cranking away), but Yong is careful to point out when the data behind wild claims about bacterial miracles is just a little too shaky to trust. There's a lack of quantification for much of what Yong says, but I blame the state of the research field more than his skills as a science writer for a popular audience. He qualifies and admits the inherent weaknesses that a number of studies about the microbiome have; frankly, there is plenty of bad science out there. Instead, Yong chooses to look optimistically, to pique our attention towards the great potential for research results that are yet to be released. Though the information can become a little dense at times, Yong delivers a wide berth of information with easily digestible and dynamic language. At times, he writes with almost a childlike wonder at the biology, passionate about new discoveries and the future directions of research. Microbes are an undeniable part of each of us, and though Yong doesn't go full force towards heavy hitting questions about who we are, there is plenty of relevance to our lives and our worldview stocked in this book. Ultimately, I Contain Multitudes leaves us readers with our hopes raised for some incredible scientific advancements to be made with the proper lens—a lens zoomed into the microbes, that is."

Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes."" - Walt WhitmanI'm a priori inclined to like bacteria. My favorite is Oenococcus Oeni, even though that's not the only bacteria that causes the poorly-named malolactic fermentation during winemaking (malolactic conversion is better jargon, but I digress). No one really extols the virtues of super young red wine (I mean, besides those marketing masters in Beaujolais, but I'm firmly of the opinion that, if the terroir's worth tastin', skip the carbonic maceration). Straight out of the fermentation tank, red wine tastes like tart apples, which is not generally what you want. Introduce a little Oenococcus Oeni, and the apple taste softens up into butter. And I don't trust people who don't like butter.Northern California is apparently swarming with hippies, such as myself, who imagine that we're all interconnected cosmic beings embracing within a universal stew (or maybe cheese plate, we do a lot of wine and cheese up here, and I've been driving through redwoods for a few hours so it's a little hard for me to come up with a fitting metaphor). I Contain Multitudes is not only poetically written, but it deepens the feeling that we're all in this together. It's kind of like that episode of The Magic School Bus where the gang shrinks to the size of a blood cell and floats around the human body, but for educated grown ups who also listen to NPR. I recommend I Contain Multitudes, especially for people who want a more nuanced explanation of the hygiene hypothesis, fecal transplants, probiotics, and other bacteria-related stuff being reported in the news these days. Also recommended for stoners who want to think about the fact that we live in cities, but we also contain cities of bacteria, and the bacteria are floating in our bodies, and we're all fucking floating in space."
475,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5164471-geoffrey-benn,4,"“I Contain Multitudes,” is the first book by one of my favorite science journalists, Ed Yong. The focus of the book is microbiomes – the microbial ecosystems that exist on and in nearly every object on our planet (including us). Yong initially explores how scientific perceptions of the microbial world have changed from the first studies by Leeuwenhoek to the golden age of antibiotics to our microbiome-paper-a-day modern era and then jumps into ongoing microbiome research. The book is rich in excerpts from interviews with many leading scientists and covers a range of topics from the human microbiome to ecological consequences of altering microbial communities. As with Yong’s writing elsewhere, it is exciting and engaging while remaining rigorously factual and avoiding sensationalism. My one criticism is that the book lacked a strong over-arching narrative – it felt like I was jumping from one fascinating story to the next without a clear sense of direction. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in gaining a more nuanced understanding of the microbial world."

Ed Yong has captured a superb snapshot of a rapidly developing field. Microbes are not good or bad, as we used to be taught. They just are. Every animal, including us of course, is a dynamic ecosystem balancing countless species of bacteria plus viruses and other icky things. Microbes have evolved along with each other and animals in a balance that usually works best for everyone, because they were naturally selected to do so.Ed Yong writes so beautifully and naturally that you can gallop through this book with joy. His sly witticisms, stories, and elegant prose make a very complex subject understandable and consistently fascinating. And how refreshing it is to hear him say wee, poo, and squirting from its backside instead of pretending to be grown up with scientific Latinisms."

I know people don't often describe science books as beautiful, but this one is.The author presents an inclusive and harmonious picture of the complex universe of microorganisms. It was easy to see that he has a passion for the subject. His writing, at times, could be described as poetic. I can't pretend that I understood or will remember the majority of what he said but, it wasn't really that kind of book. This is a book that is meant to inspire the reader with a greater sense of wonder at the beauty and complexity of both our own bodies and of the world around us.I may just have to take a microbiology class at my local Jr College to gain a better understanding of the material this book covered."

480,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"If you’ve already read books like Martin Blaser’s Missing Microbes, a lot of this info won’t be new to you. However, Ed Yong’s enthusiasm and wider range — dipping into the microbes of other animals and even insects — is a joy. He also provides a counterpoint to some of Blaser’s more hysterical ideas about the loss of microbes. He agrees that microbes are important, and that our relationships with them are complex. But he doesn’t accept that we’re totally doomed. There’s tons of research into repopulating our guts with beneficial microbes, prebiotics and probiotics. No doubt things are in the pipeline which will make a difference.Yong is significantly less hopeful about the potential of procedures like faecal transplants — though the results have been encouraging in cases of C. difficile infections, the potential for treating inflammatory bowel disease seems more limited. It’s not impossible that a refined version of faecal transplants can help to rebalance the irritated and inflamed gut systems of people who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases… but so far, the data isn’t there.With his enthusiasm and interest, Yong makes me want to hurry the heck up, get my biology degree, and get stuck into researching on exactly these topics. One thing is for sure: our microbiome is incredibly important, and we need more research. Our gut microbes can affect our overall health in so many ways — mental health included — that I foresee a lot more time being spent on this in labs in the near future. And I hope I’ll be one of the people working in one of those labs.If you don’t know much about microbes, fear not: Yong’s writing is clear and accessible, with no technobabble.

It's not that I don't want to learn about the bacteria on and in bugs and hyenas and such, but I read this book, hoping to learn more about how microbes affect humans, positively and/or negatively. I was hoping for more discussion of pathogens and illness. That's just where my fascination lies. Yong says in the Afterword that his goal in writing this book was to look at the microbiome as a whole and NOT focus on humans, so he did a great job of that. He makes it clear that bacteria are important to all life, not just to humans. Because, after all, there was life way before we humans were created, and there are many more non-human creatures than human ones on our planet. Besides, it's a more holistic view of life, a ""grander view,"" if you will, than we usually have. I recommend this book because it's eyeopening and educational. I learned a lot about microbes but also about life in general. It's funny and interesting. Yong has a unique voice, complete with corny jokes and wording, which makes this book about microbes accessible to anyone with an interest in the subject. My dad and I read this book together. From a quote in an early chapter until today, upon finishing, my dad kept bugging (pun intended) me about getting him a shirt that says, ""Microbe Lives Matter."" Maybe I'll just get him the shirt, so he'll stop pest-ering me. But, really. He wants a shirt that says that..."

Naturally, I will draw parallels.Ed Yong's goal in this book appears to be proving that our symbiosis with microbes is rooted in our origins, and while many commercial products might tell us otherwise, is absolutely necessary for our healthy lives. From the very first signs of life billions of years ago to modern day, microbes have essentially been dictating the rules by which complex beings evolve, absorb nutrients, battle toxins, and communicate with others. It is not always an easy coexistence, but like a pair of old roommates, we learn to feed off each other's best qualities.Read the rest of the review on: Chaika Books"

485,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116660907-brian,5,"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life by Ed Yong dives into the wonderful and often misunderstood field of microbiology. Yong will unravel discoveries and knock down conspiracies — all while talking about microbes! Microbes will never be the same once you have read this book. The myriad microbes in our bodies are collectively known as the microbiome or microbiota. Microbes are a big part of our lives. According to Yong, our oxygen is produced by photosynthetic microbes in the ocean and the bacteria in chloroplasts (we would not be here without them!). Though most cast microbes as antagonists, ""[t]here are fewer than 100 species of bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans""(11). Our microbes also supplement our body cells. It carries a whopping 500 times more genes than your cells. What your body cells cannot do, your microbes are most likely capable of.  We then dive into a crash course on microbiology's history. While looking through his microscope, the famous lens maker, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, found vast populations of microbes which he christened ""animalcules."" The field of microbiology made no significant advances until the nineteenth century, when Louis Pasteur proposed that microbes could be the agents of disease. Before then, disease was thought to be ""caused by bad air, or miasma, released from rotting matter""(32). Another breakthrough was seen when Joseph Lister introduced the use of antiseptic for medical purposes. The classification of microbes was enhanced by Carl Woese. In different bacterial samples, he found a common molecule called 16S rRNA. A discovery was made when Woese studied methanogens: ""when he looked at its 16S rRNA, he realized it was decidedly un-bacterial""(41). The methanogens were later reclassified as archaea. What marked this as a monumental step for biology in general was Woese's method of ""comparing genes to work out how species are related to each other""(41). This opened the path to metagenomics. Later scientist were able to ""extract the DNA from all local microbes, cut it into small fragments, and sequence them together""(43).  According to tests done on sterilized mice, ""microbes activated a wide range of mouse genes"" and ""told them how to use their own genes to make a healthy gut""(54). Microbes also ""stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cells, while others induce dove-like anti-inflammatory cells … they allow us to react to threats without overreacting""(64). Without this equilibrium, we would not be able to respond to harmful threats while overreacting to harmless one. Yong notes the irony of this. While many think of our immune system as a defense that destroys microbes, ""microbes craft and tune our immune system in the first place!""(64). When research showed that microbes affect the brain and behavior, scientists experimented on sterilized mice and ""by swapping the bacteria in the animal's guts … also swapped part of their personalities""(72). Microbes even release a chemical called dopamine, which inhibits satisfaction. By releasing dopamine when you eat certain foods, microbes can potentially hone your diet to benefit them. Sadly, our little friends can turn on us sometimes. Many viruses actually control the microbes in your body which have gone rogue. These are called microphages: ""When they touch down on a bacterium, they inject their DNA and turn the microbes into a factory for making more phages""(89). Our immune system helps us control our microbes: ""It's more about balance and good management than defence and destruction""(91).  Yong describes our immune system as an ""immunostat."" When relaxed, it can encourage invasions from outside microbes. When intensified, the immune system attacks harmless microbes and cause inflammation. With our modern sanitation, Yong claims that we have tuned our ""immunostats"" to be set toward the latter. This inadvertently induces problems such as allergies. The lack of fiber in modern diets also affect our intense ""immunostat."" When microbes break down bacteria, a chemical called short fatty acid (SCFA) is produced. These galvanize an increase in our anti-inflammatory cells. Fibers also encourage the colonization of helpful microbes with certain digestive enzymes. Our modern world has ""cut off routes by which microbes reach us, and then starve those that make it""(125). We then use the microbes' own weaponry, antibiotics, to kill both harmful and helpful microbes. Without a healthy microbiome, many pathogens can easily penetrate our body. But Yong does not suggest that antibiotics never be utilized; instead, he warns of their overuse which ""disrupts our microbiome and foments the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria""(128).  Microbes also utilize the special power of horizontal gene transfers (HGTs). All microbes are able to transmit genes to one another. There is a scary aspect to this. Microbes with mutations that allow them to be resistant to antibiotics can transfer its genes to other microbes, making them antibiotic-resistant. Yong describes this as ""one of the greatest public health threats of the twenty-first century""(192). But, as with all things, we can harness HGT for our benefit. Yong illustrates this through nori. Nori, which contains special carbohydrates, cannot be digested by regular enzymes. But marine Zobellia can digest it! When nori was eaten raw, Zobellia found on the nori was also eaten. As the Zobellia passed through the gut, it transferred its genes to other microbes. This is why many Japanese are able to digest nori. So hypothetically, if we need some benefit a microbe has, we just need it to pass through our body and allow it to carry out HGT.  Yong imagines an à la carte future , where scientists can equip microbes with specific genes. Scientists could program the microbes to eliminate certain harmful substances. This is the wonderful future of synthetic biology: Synthetic biologist aren't limited to sending microbes after pathogens. They might also train their creations to eliminate cancer cells or convert toxins into medicines. (239) In this book, Yong takes readers on a fascinating ride through the history and application of microbiology. It contains compelling anecdotes which are sprinkled with a topping of information. For readers interested in how microbes affect our lives, Ed Yong's I Contain Multitudes is the book to devour."
486,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23212031-james-foster,5,"There is a scientific revolution happening right now that is changing how we think about living things, including ourselves. The new realization is that the world is dominated by organisms too small to see. Put another way, large organisms like us are passengers, not drivers, despite our egotistical assumptions to the contrary. The subtitle of Yong’s new book, “the Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life,” exactly captures the thrill of these microbiome studies. A microbiome comprises the microscopic organisms associated with an organism or ecosystem. We are learning that the living things we can see are dominated by, and cannot exist without, their microbiomes We are also learning that microbiomes are far more complicated and ubiquitous than we ever imagined. Here are some examples. All oxygen on earth comes from bacteria—most of it directly from oceanic algae, but some from molecular devices in plants that have descended from bacteria that invaded the plant ancestors long ago. Bacteria exist everywhere we have looked—miles down in solid rock, in boiling water, deep in the black ocean, in NASA “clean rooms,” in “sterile” hospitals, in insects, plants, soil, air, and of course in and on your skin, teeth, guts, genitals, nasal cavities, etc. In fact, everywhere we have actually looked has bacteria, including healthy breast milk, amniotic fluid (probably), blood, semen, lungs, and more. Moreover, these microbiomes can have hundreds (as in human dentitia, milk, and vaginas) to thousands (as in mammalian guts) of different kinds of bacteria. You cannot survive in the real world without your bacteria. To give just one example, your bacteria produce essential amino acids that your body cannot synthesize or extract from what you eat. Other examples of our reliance on bacteria: they fix nitrogen for plants, digest grass for cattle and wood for termites, produce antibiotics, determine the sex of some insects, and more. Even cooler, in my opinion, is that we don’t know what most of these bacteria are, how they live, or what they do. We only know they are there. This means that every time we look, we are very likely to discover (many) new “species” of bacteria. It is as if every time we examine a tablespoon of dirt, a wall swab, or a breath of air, we make a major new discovery, far surpassing Darwin’s experiences on the Beagle.Yet we can only grow about 3% (estimated) of the bacteria we find. So, how do we know they are there? We take all the DNA in a sample (a skin swab, a bit of poop, some dirt, whatever), chop it up, sequence it, and put the sequences back together. This is new. Only in the last 15 years or so have we been able to sequence unknown DNA on very large scales. It used to be necessary to already know what part of a DNA molecule looked like, in order to design so-called “primers” to jump start the sequencing process. Moreover, we used to need to grow bacteria before we could get enough DNA to sequence. In both cases, this presumed we already knew quite a bit about what bacteria were present, so that discovery was very limited. Also, until recently, computers were not powerful enough to handle huge volumes of data, or to figure out which DNA fragments belonged together. Not so long ago, the accepted wisdom was that bacteria (and viruses, and microscopic fungi) were mostly bad, either giving us diseases, damaging our crops, or infecting our livestock. The assumption was that “bacteria” and “pathogen” were nearly synonymous. After all, we call our current theory of disease “the germ theory”. I remember once giving a talk about microbiomes at a public event in the Moscow Alehouse while people were enjoying their beer and burgers. Afterwards, a clearly upset patron approached me, complaining that he didn’t want to hear about nasty bacteria, especially in his gut, while he was eating. I was astonished. Didn’t he realize that the ex-cow he was eating wouldn’t exist without bacteria or that he couldn’t digest it without his own gut bacteria, let alone that the alcohol in his beer was essentially yeast excrement? We need to stop thinking about the microscopic world as the enemy, and instead think of ourselves (and our crops, livestock, homes, etc.) as partners with them. Hence Yong’s subtitle, “a Grander View of Life.”That bacteria dominate the world really shouldn’t be a surprise. They far out number us. A patch of your intestine the size of your thumbnail has more bacteria than all humans that have ever existed. It shouldn’t be a surprise that they can do so many things or that they live in so many places. They were the only living things on Earth for two billion year, almost half of Earth’s existence. We shouldn’t be surprised that the human body has 100 times more bacterial than human genes. Humans have only for about one five hundredth of one percent of the time that bacteria have. I think it is unfortunate that Yong didn’t go with the shorter and, I think, more accurate and interesting title that he mentions in passing, namely “I Am Multitudes.” This is a bacterial planet.Full disclosure: when I have on my scientist hat, this is what I do for a living. I study cool microbiomes, such as the skin microbiome of a highly toxic newt, the microbiome in breast milk, the microbiome of mud from the bottom of the ocean, the human vaginal microbiome, and the microbiome in the gut of premature infants with cystic fibrosis. As a computer scientist, most of what I do is develop new algorithms interpret DNA data, but I also sometimes work directly with the biology. I chose to do microbiome science because it is so very cool to be part of a scientific revolution, and because the people, such as those profiled in this book, are fascinating.I have intentionally not given any details about which microbiomes Yong discusses, nor what they do in their environments. I don’t want to spoil the discoveries for you. Suffice it to say that I Contain Multitudes captures the excitement and scope of this field. Read it. You will be infected, intellectually!"
487,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"Famously, according to Douglas Adams, The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (not the novel, the 'actual' guide) begin by telling you at length how big space is, but then 'After a while the style settles down a bit and it starts telling you things you actually need to know' - and the opening of Ed Yong's exploration of the microbiome, the complex world of bacterial life inside us and generally in living things and around the world, is rather reminiscent of this. In the first couple of chapters, we are fed fact after fact in a staccato collection of information that has no sense of narrative or flow, rather like a set of frenzied bullet points, which becomes wearing for the reader. For example there are two paragraphs in a row, one with practically all the sentences starting 'They', and the next with almost all beginning 'We'll'. Thankfully, though, like the HHGTTG, We Are Multitude then settles down and gets on with job in hand.It's a job that Ed Yong does very well. It's hardly news that we have many, many bacterial cells in us (though it does biologists no scientific favours when we discover the much used 'ten times as many as human cells' figure was just picked out of the air and has no scientific basis). However, Yong quickly takes us beyond that to explore the nuances of a very intricate relationship between bacteria and more complex life that could be summarised as 'Can't live with them, can't live without them.' Even many of our most hated bacterial foes can have positive roles at the right place and the right time.What certainly comes across is that our knee-jerk reaction of 'germs are bad' leads to an overemphasis on removing them, where actually they are often doing a useful job. When we go mad with our antibacterial cleansers, we are more like to wipe out good bacteria, leaving space for colonisation by nasties, than we are to simply kill off a threat. And Yong gives us a dramatic tour of the sheer variety of microbes and the environments in which different bacterial life can thrive, whether we talking black smokers or dolphin armpits.Every now and then, we get some excellent storytelling, but the use of example after example does give the impression to the non-biologist of the kind of approach that led Rutherford to comment that all science is either physics or stamp collecting - there is a fair amount of stamp collecting here. However, whenever the reader is beginning to feel that they are losing interest, up comes a really interesting part. I loved, for example, the story of the way that bacteria actually re-engineer the physical structure of a glow-in-the-dark squid. And it's hard not be impressed by the description of bacteria surveys being undertaken in a brand new hospital as it is brought into use, to see where the bugs come from. One of the particularly engaging observations is the emphasis on the benefits of open windows to allow bacteria to come in from the outside. Your mum's enthusiasm for getting you out in the fresh air was justified after all.If there's one message the reader comes away with, it's that we need to be more nuanced in our thinking about bacteria - sometimes, it seems almost to be a case of 'sit back and enjoy the ride, because whatever you do will probably mess things up.' You'll never look at a probiotic yogurt drink or a bottle of toilet cleaner the same again."

However, as the author shows, there is currently a lot of hype surrounding some aspects of the microbiome, like in probiotics and fecal transplants. This book will help readers to navigate the minefield of papers and articles about the microbiome and show you just what we know and, more importantly, what we still don't know about it and how it can affect our lives and the environment.Ed Yong starts with a look at how people like Leeuwenhoek discovered the world of bacteria and then goes on to show how microbes can interact with multi-celled organisms, like us, to form and grow them; for the fact is the genes and cells of animals (and probably plants) need the microbes to help mediate the growth of bodies. Experiments with sterile (germ-free) animals show they don't grow or develop well without the microbes.However, the microbes are not the selfless helpers of animals. Like any other organism, they also act in their self-interest and will grow and multiply uncontrollably inside animals (causing diseases) unless they are controlled by the body. This back-and-forth of conflict and cooperation is shown to occur not just in bodies but also in our environment. Numerous examples, from coral reefs that grow or die depending on which types of microbes are around, to malnutrition in children, are evidence of the action of different kinds of microbiomes.Now that we are starting to learn about microbiomes, what can we do about it. Here, the author covers the various experiments and studies that have been conducted or are being conducted to try to understand how various microbiomes work. He is also careful not to over-state the results of the studies for, in reality, we still know very little about the interactions of the microbes in the microbiomes and the changes we introduce may be for the better or worse.This book covers the very latest research into the microbiome; a look at the very long list of endnotes show some research where the results have yet to be published at the book's release. A definite must-read for those who want a glimpse of how microbes, despite their very small size, can affect our environment in surprising ways."
489,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,5,"Ed Yong may just be the best science writer currently working. In either case, this regular contributor to The Atlantic has written a brilliant book about the teeming microbial communities that live inside us, governing our health, illness, allergies and relationships with others.People who know about this topic generally have heard about it in terms of the somewhat offputting idea of fecal transplants, in which people with persistent C. difficile gut infections have been cured by giving them a sample of someone else's stool. It is a mark of how broad and incisive this book is that Yong doesn't get to the fecal transplant topic until the penultimate chapter.The rest of the book ranges far and wide through nature, from the scientist studying the microbiomes of zoo animals to the ones studying light emitting squids to those that are cataloging how microbial communities grow inside buildings ranging from hospitals to hotel rooms.Yong explains with literate craft how we have been hampered by a simplistic two-sided view of this hugely diverse microbial world. We either think of microbes as disease causing baddies that need to be vanquished, or as benign ""probiotic"" species that will turn us into healthy Birkenstock-wearing granola-crunching citizens. In fact, these microbial communities live in a tenuous and shifting balance with their hosts, whether they are mosquitoes, beewolf wasps or human beings, and if we aren't careful, tampering with these communities can cause more harm than good.Nevertheless, there are many exciting possibilities being explored by researchers for making our lives better, from breeding mosquitoes than are incapable of carrying the dengue or Zika viruses, to 3D-printed balls that will seed our hospital rooms with healthy microbes to specially designed microbial pills that can be dispensed to deal with an individual's particular ailment.We truly do contain multitudes, and this is one of the best, most gracefully written and cutting edge science books I've encountered."

They live on our surface, inside our bodies, and sometimes inside our very cells. the vast majority of them are bacteria, but there are also other tiny organisms including fungi (such as yeasts) and archaea... There are viruses too, in unfathomable numbers...I've read some books recently about the microbiome. The Hidden Half of Nature: The Microbial Roots of Life and Health touched on it, but not satisfyingly enough. Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics Is Fueling Our Modern Plagues was really great, although almost a bit too evangelistic in his fervor for our resident bacteria and his ideas of how our mistreatment of it might be driving modern diseases. Ed Yong does a great job of toning that down a little and explaining how scientists believe our bodies became so dependent upon them for our health.Unfortunately, much of the book doesn't really talk about the human microbiome at all. He talks about pangolins and squid and aphids and termites and mealy bugs and... you get the (sometimes tedious) point. For me the strongest parts were where he discussed how our microbiome helps us to digest foods or how it protects us from sickness. Some points I got from the book were that human health is best with 1) natural childbirth, 2) breast-feeding, and 3) having pets in the home, especially dogs. And I absolutely loved his sense of humor - a little on the dry side, but right up my alley. So, while I was hoping for more emphasis on human health, it was still a very interesting book."
491,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5039223-ben-gutierrez,3,"For most of human history, microbes were invisible to us, though we sometimes saw their effects. After they were discovered, we paid most attention to the bacteria that caused disease or the bacteria that could fight disease.In recent decades, our attitude has shifted from fighting bacteria at every step, to understanding its vital role in the health of all living species. With the new view of bacteria, and our greater ability to understand it, we've begun to use it in ever subtler ways to improve the health of ourselves and other species.If you want a shorter read, try reading the first few chapters, which outline the history of our understanding of bacteria and will give you an idea of how amazing it is. Then, read the last two chapters: Microbes à la Carte and Tomorrow the World.The last two might be the most important, because almost all popular journalism about bacteria comes with all these promises of how bacteria will cure weight gain, how a new superbug is going to wipe out the entire human species, or how eating yogurt, kombucha, and sauerkraut is going to give you the bowel movements you've always dreamed of. At least, that's always my interpretation of these articles. The last portion of the book sheds more light on these ideas, and thereby tempers them. It's not that bacteria isn't dynamic cellular life in its rawest form that can do pretty much anything. It is and it can. But life is very complex and often does not have simple solutions."

It does touch on it, but it covers so much more. How microbes interact in nature and with other animals, how our hospitals may actually be too clean and causing us harm, how probiotics you can buy may not be what you think they are (they are overly hyped), how microbes work in teams at times, how too much of a good thing is actually a bad thing.

Great anecdotes framed by a biographical sketch: meet a scientist, hear how they had a question and pursued the answer, etc. Wonderful descriptions of the lifecycle of different microbes, their impact on host organisms, and author's speculation on how the symbiosis began.But the author repeats this template over and over again. A magazine story repeated twenty times. All these wonderful details remained details."

To finish it and gush about what I have learned, recommend it to my loved ones, and hear similarly great reviews. Buckle up. This is not that review. I did not enjoy this book. In fact, there were several moments that this felt like a punishment. Many of the chapters felt convoluted and meandering. I gained some fun parcels of knowledge. I can better appreciate how the microbiotic world impacts all of evolution. Amazing. Thinking about medicine as gardening instead of warfare? Meaningful. But, these bits of knowledge do not outweigh the book overall."

As an individual, you are not measured just by your mettle but by the mettle of your microbiome⁠—all the microbes collectively on and in your person. I Contain Multitudes boldly brings to your attention just how teeming the world and we are with invisible life.As some of the earliest forms of life on Earth, bacteria have developed diverse mechanisms and processes to survive on land, sea, and the most extreme environments. In the words of Yong, bacteria are ""metabolic wizards,"" now my new favorite way of describing how they can break down most anything: crude oil, plastics, plant material, you name it. In essence, if there's a way, you can bet there's a bacteria that has found it. Ed Yong's goal here is to dispel the overwhelming notion that bacteria are an evil to be eradicated, the infamous pathogens responsible for tuberculosis, cholera, tetanus, and the plague. Those bacteria are only a tiny drop in the bucket; there's a planet full of fascinating microbes that are harmless or, taking it a step further, essential for animal survival.The numerous examples which Yong provides of important symbiotic, or mutually beneficial, relationships between animal and bacteria demonstrate that such mutual coevolution simply cannot be ignored. Insects, squids, and yes, humans would find their immune defense and nutritional health wanting should the little microbes disappear. Mention about the scary Clostridium difficile, a bacteria that ravages the human gut when antibiotics clean out the healthy microbes within, hits close to home about the importance of recognizing the microbiome as a community, a vibrant ecosystem. There has only been a recent paradigm shift in recognizing both scientifically and medically that bacteria aren't solely organisms which ought to be nuked out of existence. On the flip side, that can lead to some overzealous claims about their benevolence (sorry, natural selection is still cranking away), but Yong is careful to point out when the data behind wild claims about bacterial miracles is just a little too shaky to trust. There's a lack of quantification for much of what Yong says, but I blame the state of the research field more than his skills as a science writer for a popular audience. He qualifies and admits the inherent weaknesses that a number of studies about the microbiome have; frankly, there is plenty of bad science out there. Instead, Yong chooses to look optimistically, to pique our attention towards the great potential for research results that are yet to be released. Though the information can become a little dense at times, Yong delivers a wide berth of information with easily digestible and dynamic language. At times, he writes with almost a childlike wonder at the biology, passionate about new discoveries and the future directions of research. Microbes are an undeniable part of each of us, and though Yong doesn't go full force towards heavy hitting questions about who we are, there is plenty of relevance to our lives and our worldview stocked in this book. Ultimately, I Contain Multitudes leaves us readers with our hopes raised for some incredible scientific advancements to be made with the proper lens—a lens zoomed into the microbes, that is."

Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes."" - Walt WhitmanI'm a priori inclined to like bacteria. My favorite is Oenococcus Oeni, even though that's not the only bacteria that causes the poorly-named malolactic fermentation during winemaking (malolactic conversion is better jargon, but I digress). No one really extols the virtues of super young red wine (I mean, besides those marketing masters in Beaujolais, but I'm firmly of the opinion that, if the terroir's worth tastin', skip the carbonic maceration). Straight out of the fermentation tank, red wine tastes like tart apples, which is not generally what you want. Introduce a little Oenococcus Oeni, and the apple taste softens up into butter. And I don't trust people who don't like butter.Northern California is apparently swarming with hippies, such as myself, who imagine that we're all interconnected cosmic beings embracing within a universal stew (or maybe cheese plate, we do a lot of wine and cheese up here, and I've been driving through redwoods for a few hours so it's a little hard for me to come up with a fitting metaphor). I Contain Multitudes is not only poetically written, but it deepens the feeling that we're all in this together. It's kind of like that episode of The Magic School Bus where the gang shrinks to the size of a blood cell and floats around the human body, but for educated grown ups who also listen to NPR. I recommend I Contain Multitudes, especially for people who want a more nuanced explanation of the hygiene hypothesis, fecal transplants, probiotics, and other bacteria-related stuff being reported in the news these days. Also recommended for stoners who want to think about the fact that we live in cities, but we also contain cities of bacteria, and the bacteria are floating in our bodies, and we're all fucking floating in space."

The focus of the book is microbiomes – the microbial ecosystems that exist on and in nearly every object on our planet (including us). Yong initially explores how scientific perceptions of the microbial world have changed from the first studies by Leeuwenhoek to the golden age of antibiotics to our microbiome-paper-a-day modern era and then jumps into ongoing microbiome research. The book is rich in excerpts from interviews with many leading scientists and covers a range of topics from the human microbiome to ecological consequences of altering microbial communities. As with Yong’s writing elsewhere, it is exciting and engaging while remaining rigorously factual and avoiding sensationalism. My one criticism is that the book lacked a strong over-arching narrative – it felt like I was jumping from one fascinating story to the next without a clear sense of direction. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in gaining a more nuanced understanding of the microbial world."

Ed Yong has captured a superb snapshot of a rapidly developing field. Microbes are not good or bad, as we used to be taught. They just are. Every animal, including us of course, is a dynamic ecosystem balancing countless species of bacteria plus viruses and other icky things. Microbes have evolved along with each other and animals in a balance that usually works best for everyone, because they were naturally selected to do so.Ed Yong writes so beautifully and naturally that you can gallop through this book with joy. His sly witticisms, stories, and elegant prose make a very complex subject understandable and consistently fascinating. And how refreshing it is to hear him say wee, poo, and squirting from its backside instead of pretending to be grown up with scientific Latinisms."

I can't pretend that I understood or will remember the majority of what he said but, it wasn't really that kind of book.

510,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"If you’ve already read books like Martin Blaser’s Missing Microbes, a lot of this info won’t be new to you. However, Ed Yong’s enthusiasm and wider range — dipping into the microbes of other animals and even insects — is a joy. He also provides a counterpoint to some of Blaser’s more hysterical ideas about the loss of microbes. He agrees that microbes are important, and that our relationships with them are complex. But he doesn’t accept that we’re totally doomed. There’s tons of research into repopulating our guts with beneficial microbes, prebiotics and probiotics. No doubt things are in the pipeline which will make a difference.Yong is significantly less hopeful about the potential of procedures like faecal transplants — though the results have been encouraging in cases of C. difficile infections, the potential for treating inflammatory bowel disease seems more limited. It’s not impossible that a refined version of faecal transplants can help to rebalance the irritated and inflamed gut systems of people who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases… but so far, the data isn’t there.With his enthusiasm and interest, Yong makes me want to hurry the heck up, get my biology degree, and get stuck into researching on exactly these topics. One thing is for sure: our microbiome is incredibly important, and we need more research. Our gut microbes can affect our overall health in so many ways — mental health included — that I foresee a lot more time being spent on this in labs in the near future. And I hope I’ll be one of the people working in one of those labs.If you don’t know much about microbes, fear not: Yong’s writing is clear and accessible, with no technobabble.

It's not that I don't want to learn about the bacteria on and in bugs and hyenas and such, but I read this book, hoping to learn more about how microbes affect humans, positively and/or negatively. I was hoping for more discussion of pathogens and illness. That's just where my fascination lies. Yong says in the Afterword that his goal in writing this book was to look at the microbiome as a whole and NOT focus on humans, so he did a great job of that. He makes it clear that bacteria are important to all life, not just to humans. Because, after all, there was life way before we humans were created, and there are many more non-human creatures than human ones on our planet. Besides, it's a more holistic view of life, a ""grander view,"" if you will, than we usually have. I recommend this book because it's eyeopening and educational. I learned a lot about microbes but also about life in general. It's funny and interesting. Yong has a unique voice, complete with corny jokes and wording, which makes this book about microbes accessible to anyone with an interest in the subject. My dad and I read this book together. From a quote in an early chapter until today, upon finishing, my dad kept bugging (pun intended) me about getting him a shirt that says, ""Microbe Lives Matter.""

Naturally, I will draw parallels.Ed Yong's goal in this book appears to be proving that our symbiosis with microbes is rooted in our origins, and while many commercial products might tell us otherwise, is absolutely necessary for our healthy lives. From the very first signs of life billions of years ago to modern day, microbes have essentially been dictating the rules by which complex beings evolve, absorb nutrients, battle toxins, and communicate with others. It is not always an easy coexistence, but like a pair of old roommates, we learn to feed off each other's best qualities.Read the rest of the review on: Chaika Books"

515,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116660907-brian,5,"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life by Ed Yong dives into the wonderful and often misunderstood field of microbiology. Yong will unravel discoveries and knock down conspiracies — all while talking about microbes! Microbes will never be the same once you have read this book. The myriad microbes in our bodies are collectively known as the microbiome or microbiota. Microbes are a big part of our lives. According to Yong, our oxygen is produced by photosynthetic microbes in the ocean and the bacteria in chloroplasts (we would not be here without them!). Though most cast microbes as antagonists, ""[t]here are fewer than 100 species of bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans""(11). Our microbes also supplement our body cells. It carries a whopping 500 times more genes than your cells. What your body cells cannot do, your microbes are most likely capable of.  We then dive into a crash course on microbiology's history. While looking through his microscope, the famous lens maker, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, found vast populations of microbes which he christened ""animalcules."" The field of microbiology made no significant advances until the nineteenth century, when Louis Pasteur proposed that microbes could be the agents of disease. Before then, disease was thought to be ""caused by bad air, or miasma, released from rotting matter""(32). Another breakthrough was seen when Joseph Lister introduced the use of antiseptic for medical purposes. The classification of microbes was enhanced by Carl Woese. In different bacterial samples, he found a common molecule called 16S rRNA. A discovery was made when Woese studied methanogens: ""when he looked at its 16S rRNA, he realized it was decidedly un-bacterial""(41). The methanogens were later reclassified as archaea. What marked this as a monumental step for biology in general was Woese's method of ""comparing genes to work out how species are related to each other""(41). This opened the path to metagenomics. Later scientist were able to ""extract the DNA from all local microbes, cut it into small fragments, and sequence them together""(43).  According to tests done on sterilized mice, ""microbes activated a wide range of mouse genes"" and ""told them how to use their own genes to make a healthy gut""(54). Microbes also ""stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cells, while others induce dove-like anti-inflammatory cells … they allow us to react to threats without overreacting""(64). Without this equilibrium, we would not be able to respond to harmful threats while overreacting to harmless one. Yong notes the irony of this. While many think of our immune system as a defense that destroys microbes, ""microbes craft and tune our immune system in the first place!""(64). When research showed that microbes affect the brain and behavior, scientists experimented on sterilized mice and ""by swapping the bacteria in the animal's guts … also swapped part of their personalities""(72). Microbes even release a chemical called dopamine, which inhibits satisfaction. By releasing dopamine when you eat certain foods, microbes can potentially hone your diet to benefit them. Sadly, our little friends can turn on us sometimes. Many viruses actually control the microbes in your body which have gone rogue. These are called microphages: ""When they touch down on a bacterium, they inject their DNA and turn the microbes into a factory for making more phages""(89). Our immune system helps us control our microbes: ""It's more about balance and good management than defence and destruction""(91).  Yong describes our immune system as an ""immunostat."" When relaxed, it can encourage invasions from outside microbes. When intensified, the immune system attacks harmless microbes and cause inflammation. With our modern sanitation, Yong claims that we have tuned our ""immunostats"" to be set toward the latter. This inadvertently induces problems such as allergies. The lack of fiber in modern diets also affect our intense ""immunostat."" When microbes break down bacteria, a chemical called short fatty acid (SCFA) is produced. These galvanize an increase in our anti-inflammatory cells. Fibers also encourage the colonization of helpful microbes with certain digestive enzymes. Our modern world has ""cut off routes by which microbes reach us, and then starve those that make it""(125). We then use the microbes' own weaponry, antibiotics, to kill both harmful and helpful microbes. Without a healthy microbiome, many pathogens can easily penetrate our body. But Yong does not suggest that antibiotics never be utilized; instead, he warns of their overuse which ""disrupts our microbiome and foments the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria""(128).  Microbes also utilize the special power of horizontal gene transfers (HGTs). All microbes are able to transmit genes to one another. There is a scary aspect to this. Microbes with mutations that allow them to be resistant to antibiotics can transfer its genes to other microbes, making them antibiotic-resistant. Yong describes this as ""one of the greatest public health threats of the twenty-first century""(192). But, as with all things, we can harness HGT for our benefit. Yong illustrates this through nori. Nori, which contains special carbohydrates, cannot be digested by regular enzymes. But marine Zobellia can digest it! When nori was eaten raw, Zobellia found on the nori was also eaten. As the Zobellia passed through the gut, it transferred its genes to other microbes. This is why many Japanese are able to digest nori. So hypothetically, if we need some benefit a microbe has, we just need it to pass through our body and allow it to carry out HGT.  Yong imagines an à la carte future , where scientists can equip microbes with specific genes. Scientists could program the microbes to eliminate certain harmful substances. This is the wonderful future of synthetic biology: Synthetic biologist aren't limited to sending microbes after pathogens. They might also train their creations to eliminate cancer cells or convert toxins into medicines. (239) In this book, Yong takes readers on a fascinating ride through the history and application of microbiology. It contains compelling anecdotes which are sprinkled with a topping of information. For readers interested in how microbes affect our lives, Ed Yong's I Contain Multitudes is the book to devour."
516,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23212031-james-foster,5,"There is a scientific revolution happening right now that is changing how we think about living things, including ourselves. The new realization is that the world is dominated by organisms too small to see. Put another way, large organisms like us are passengers, not drivers, despite our egotistical assumptions to the contrary. The subtitle of Yong’s new book, “the Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life,” exactly captures the thrill of these microbiome studies. A microbiome comprises the microscopic organisms associated with an organism or ecosystem. We are learning that the living things we can see are dominated by, and cannot exist without, their microbiomes We are also learning that microbiomes are far more complicated and ubiquitous than we ever imagined. Here are some examples. All oxygen on earth comes from bacteria—most of it directly from oceanic algae, but some from molecular devices in plants that have descended from bacteria that invaded the plant ancestors long ago. Bacteria exist everywhere we have looked—miles down in solid rock, in boiling water, deep in the black ocean, in NASA “clean rooms,” in “sterile” hospitals, in insects, plants, soil, air, and of course in and on your skin, teeth, guts, genitals, nasal cavities, etc. In fact, everywhere we have actually looked has bacteria, including healthy breast milk, amniotic fluid (probably), blood, semen, lungs, and more. Moreover, these microbiomes can have hundreds (as in human dentitia, milk, and vaginas) to thousands (as in mammalian guts) of different kinds of bacteria. You cannot survive in the real world without your bacteria. To give just one example, your bacteria produce essential amino acids that your body cannot synthesize or extract from what you eat. Other examples of our reliance on bacteria: they fix nitrogen for plants, digest grass for cattle and wood for termites, produce antibiotics, determine the sex of some insects, and more. Even cooler, in my opinion, is that we don’t know what most of these bacteria are, how they live, or what they do. We only know they are there. This means that every time we look, we are very likely to discover (many) new “species” of bacteria. It is as if every time we examine a tablespoon of dirt, a wall swab, or a breath of air, we make a major new discovery, far surpassing Darwin’s experiences on the Beagle.Yet we can only grow about 3% (estimated) of the bacteria we find. So, how do we know they are there? We take all the DNA in a sample (a skin swab, a bit of poop, some dirt, whatever), chop it up, sequence it, and put the sequences back together. This is new. Only in the last 15 years or so have we been able to sequence unknown DNA on very large scales. It used to be necessary to already know what part of a DNA molecule looked like, in order to design so-called “primers” to jump start the sequencing process. Moreover, we used to need to grow bacteria before we could get enough DNA to sequence. In both cases, this presumed we already knew quite a bit about what bacteria were present, so that discovery was very limited. Also, until recently, computers were not powerful enough to handle huge volumes of data, or to figure out which DNA fragments belonged together. Not so long ago, the accepted wisdom was that bacteria (and viruses, and microscopic fungi) were mostly bad, either giving us diseases, damaging our crops, or infecting our livestock. The assumption was that “bacteria” and “pathogen” were nearly synonymous. After all, we call our current theory of disease “the germ theory”. I remember once giving a talk about microbiomes at a public event in the Moscow Alehouse while people were enjoying their beer and burgers. Afterwards, a clearly upset patron approached me, complaining that he didn’t want to hear about nasty bacteria, especially in his gut, while he was eating. I was astonished. Didn’t he realize that the ex-cow he was eating wouldn’t exist without bacteria or that he couldn’t digest it without his own gut bacteria, let alone that the alcohol in his beer was essentially yeast excrement? We need to stop thinking about the microscopic world as the enemy, and instead think of ourselves (and our crops, livestock, homes, etc.) as partners with them. Hence Yong’s subtitle, “a Grander View of Life.”That bacteria dominate the world really shouldn’t be a surprise. They far out number us. A patch of your intestine the size of your thumbnail has more bacteria than all humans that have ever existed. It shouldn’t be a surprise that they can do so many things or that they live in so many places. They were the only living things on Earth for two billion year, almost half of Earth’s existence. We shouldn’t be surprised that the human body has 100 times more bacterial than human genes. Humans have only for about one five hundredth of one percent of the time that bacteria have. I think it is unfortunate that Yong didn’t go with the shorter and, I think, more accurate and interesting title that he mentions in passing, namely “I Am Multitudes.” This is a bacterial planet.Full disclosure: when I have on my scientist hat, this is what I do for a living. I study cool microbiomes, such as the skin microbiome of a highly toxic newt, the microbiome in breast milk, the microbiome of mud from the bottom of the ocean, the human vaginal microbiome, and the microbiome in the gut of premature infants with cystic fibrosis. As a computer scientist, most of what I do is develop new algorithms interpret DNA data, but I also sometimes work directly with the biology. I chose to do microbiome science because it is so very cool to be part of a scientific revolution, and because the people, such as those profiled in this book, are fascinating.I have intentionally not given any details about which microbiomes Yong discusses, nor what they do in their environments. I don’t want to spoil the discoveries for you. Suffice it to say that I Contain Multitudes captures the excitement and scope of this field. Read it. You will be infected, intellectually!"
517,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"Famously, according to Douglas Adams, The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (not the novel, the 'actual' guide) begin by telling you at length how big space is, but then 'After a while the style settles down a bit and it starts telling you things you actually need to know' - and the opening of Ed Yong's exploration of the microbiome, the complex world of bacterial life inside us and generally in living things and around the world, is rather reminiscent of this. In the first couple of chapters, we are fed fact after fact in a staccato collection of information that has no sense of narrative or flow, rather like a set of frenzied bullet points, which becomes wearing for the reader. For example there are two paragraphs in a row, one with practically all the sentences starting 'They', and the next with almost all beginning 'We'll'. Thankfully, though, like the HHGTTG, We Are Multitude then settles down and gets on with job in hand.It's a job that Ed Yong does very well. It's hardly news that we have many, many bacterial cells in us (though it does biologists no scientific favours when we discover the much used 'ten times as many as human cells' figure was just picked out of the air and has no scientific basis). However, Yong quickly takes us beyond that to explore the nuances of a very intricate relationship between bacteria and more complex life that could be summarised as 'Can't live with them, can't live without them.' Even many of our most hated bacterial foes can have positive roles at the right place and the right time.What certainly comes across is that our knee-jerk reaction of 'germs are bad' leads to an overemphasis on removing them, where actually they are often doing a useful job. When we go mad with our antibacterial cleansers, we are more like to wipe out good bacteria, leaving space for colonisation by nasties, than we are to simply kill off a threat. And Yong gives us a dramatic tour of the sheer variety of microbes and the environments in which different bacterial life can thrive, whether we talking black smokers or dolphin armpits.Every now and then, we get some excellent storytelling, but the use of example after example does give the impression to the non-biologist of the kind of approach that led Rutherford to comment that all science is either physics or stamp collecting - there is a fair amount of stamp collecting here. However, whenever the reader is beginning to feel that they are losing interest, up comes a really interesting part. I loved, for example, the story of the way that bacteria actually re-engineer the physical structure of a glow-in-the-dark squid. And it's hard not be impressed by the description of bacteria surveys being undertaken in a brand new hospital as it is brought into use, to see where the bugs come from. One of the particularly engaging observations is the emphasis on the benefits of open windows to allow bacteria to come in from the outside. Your mum's enthusiasm for getting you out in the fresh air was justified after all.If there's one message the reader comes away with, it's that we need to be more nuanced in our thinking about bacteria - sometimes, it seems almost to be a case of 'sit back and enjoy the ride, because whatever you do will probably mess things up.' You'll never look at a probiotic yogurt drink or a bottle of toilet cleaner the same again."

However, as the author shows, there is currently a lot of hype surrounding some aspects of the microbiome, like in probiotics and fecal transplants. This book will help readers to navigate the minefield of papers and articles about the microbiome and show you just what we know and, more importantly, what we still don't know about it and how it can affect our lives and the environment.Ed Yong starts with a look at how people like Leeuwenhoek discovered the world of bacteria and then goes on to show how microbes can interact with multi-celled organisms, like us, to form and grow them; for the fact is the genes and cells of animals (and probably plants) need the microbes to help mediate the growth of bodies. Experiments with sterile (germ-free) animals show they don't grow or develop well without the microbes.However, the microbes are not the selfless helpers of animals. Like any other organism, they also act in their self-interest and will grow and multiply uncontrollably inside animals (causing diseases) unless they are controlled by the body. This back-and-forth of conflict and cooperation is shown to occur not just in bodies but also in our environment. Numerous examples, from coral reefs that grow or die depending on which types of microbes are around, to malnutrition in children, are evidence of the action of different kinds of microbiomes.Now that we are starting to learn about microbiomes, what can we do about it. Here, the author covers the various experiments and studies that have been conducted or are being conducted to try to understand how various microbiomes work. He is also careful not to over-state the results of the studies for, in reality, we still know very little about the interactions of the microbes in the microbiomes and the changes we introduce may be for the better or worse.This book covers the very latest research into the microbiome; a look at the very long list of endnotes show some research where the results have yet to be published at the book's release. A definite must-read for those who want a glimpse of how microbes, despite their very small size, can affect our environment in surprising ways."
519,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,5,"Ed Yong may just be the best science writer currently working. In either case, this regular contributor to The Atlantic has written a brilliant book about the teeming microbial communities that live inside us, governing our health, illness, allergies and relationships with others.People who know about this topic generally have heard about it in terms of the somewhat offputting idea of fecal transplants, in which people with persistent C. difficile gut infections have been cured by giving them a sample of someone else's stool. It is a mark of how broad and incisive this book is that Yong doesn't get to the fecal transplant topic until the penultimate chapter.The rest of the book ranges far and wide through nature, from the scientist studying the microbiomes of zoo animals to the ones studying light emitting squids to those that are cataloging how microbial communities grow inside buildings ranging from hospitals to hotel rooms.Yong explains with literate craft how we have been hampered by a simplistic two-sided view of this hugely diverse microbial world. We either think of microbes as disease causing baddies that need to be vanquished, or as benign ""probiotic"" species that will turn us into healthy Birkenstock-wearing granola-crunching citizens. In fact, these microbial communities live in a tenuous and shifting balance with their hosts, whether they are mosquitoes, beewolf wasps or human beings, and if we aren't careful, tampering with these communities can cause more harm than good.Nevertheless, there are many exciting possibilities being explored by researchers for making our lives better, from breeding mosquitoes than are incapable of carrying the dengue or Zika viruses, to 3D-printed balls that will seed our hospital rooms with healthy microbes to specially designed microbial pills that can be dispensed to deal with an individual's particular ailment.We truly do contain multitudes, and this is one of the best, most gracefully written and cutting edge science books I've encountered."
520,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s,4,"All of us have an abundant microscopic menagerie, collectively known as the microbiota or microbiome. They live on our surface, inside our bodies, and sometimes inside our very cells. the vast majority of them are bacteria, but there are also other tiny organisms including fungi (such as yeasts) and archaea... There are viruses too, in unfathomable numbers...I've read some books recently about the microbiome. The Hidden Half of Nature: The Microbial Roots of Life and Health touched on it, but not satisfyingly enough. Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics Is Fueling Our Modern Plagues was really great, although almost a bit too evangelistic in his fervor for our resident bacteria and his ideas of how our mistreatment of it might be driving modern diseases. Ed Yong does a great job of toning that down a little and explaining how scientists believe our bodies became so dependent upon them for our health.Unfortunately, much of the book doesn't really talk about the human microbiome at all. He talks about pangolins and squid and aphids and termites and mealy bugs and... you get the (sometimes tedious) point. For me the strongest parts were where he discussed how our microbiome helps us to digest foods or how it protects us from sickness. Some points I got from the book were that human health is best with 1) natural childbirth, 2) breast-feeding, and 3) having pets in the home, especially dogs. And I absolutely loved his sense of humor - a little on the dry side, but right up my alley. So, while I was hoping for more emphasis on human health, it was still a very interesting book."
521,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5039223-ben-gutierrez,3,"For most of human history, microbes were invisible to us, though we sometimes saw their effects. After they were discovered, we paid most attention to the bacteria that caused disease or the bacteria that could fight disease.In recent decades, our attitude has shifted from fighting bacteria at every step, to understanding its vital role in the health of all living species. With the new view of bacteria, and our greater ability to understand it, we've begun to use it in ever subtler ways to improve the health of ourselves and other species.If you want a shorter read, try reading the first few chapters, which outline the history of our understanding of bacteria and will give you an idea of how amazing it is. Then, read the last two chapters: Microbes à la Carte and Tomorrow the World.The last two might be the most important, because almost all popular journalism about bacteria comes with all these promises of how bacteria will cure weight gain, how a new superbug is going to wipe out the entire human species, or how eating yogurt, kombucha, and sauerkraut is going to give you the bowel movements you've always dreamed of. At least, that's always my interpretation of these articles. The last portion of the book sheds more light on these ideas, and thereby tempers them. It's not that bacteria isn't dynamic cellular life in its rawest form that can do pretty much anything. It is and it can. But life is very complex and often does not have simple solutions."

I am glad it was my first book delving into the microbes and how they interact with life because it doesn't just focus on humans and our digestive tract. It does touch on it, but it covers so much more. How microbes interact in nature and with other animals, how our hospitals may actually be too clean and causing us harm, how probiotics you can buy may not be what you think they are (they are overly hyped), how microbes work in teams at times, how too much of a good thing is actually a bad thing. This book is great for an overview of the interactions of microbes with nature in general. It goes into a bit more detail on some of the subjects I mentioned above. I look forward to finding out more about the interactions in humans. "

The book takes us on a tour of the rapidly growing field of microbiology, demonstrating their crucial importance to species (including humans) and entire ecologies. Useful when thinking about the world and practically useful in living your life, not many science book can pull both off. Several themes I have came across before in the press or science blogs, even these capture the interest due to the quality of the writing. Bringing to life even the gross parts about fecal transplants (featuring an unfortunate blender!).Only minor quibble would be that even at a few years old large stride have already taken place that will of course not be present, that is most clear in the final chapter which feels a little threadbare compared to all of the others."

This book did not disappoint. I have been reading more and more in short news articles about the microbiome - the trillions of microbes that live within us. But this book gave the author the chance to explore the microbes of the world - from the deepest ocean, insects and animals, plant life and humans of course - and see how the multitudes of microbes at various times protect, destroy, change, adapt and interact with various hosts. It was fascinating to read about and I will look forward to finding out about new discoveries in this field."

They were here long before we were and will most certainly outlive us. That's actually not what he's saying at all, but sort of the message I took away from it. This is a super accessible science book. I thought some of it was too niche or not interesting, but none of it was too difficult to understand. I also like his carefulness in examining the crazy claims of the ""probiotics"" evangelists. The book made me feel really lucky that I was able to birth my babies naturally and breastfeed them for a year each. Human milk is remarkable!"

Microbes are opening up new avenues to deal with old problems ...... without chemicals. Who knew microbes would make for a great read.It is interesting to speculate the power of the microbe and how it can make the difference between sickness and health, death and life. "

Great anecdotes framed by a biographical sketch: meet a scientist, hear how they had a question and pursued the answer, etc. Wonderful descriptions of the lifecycle of different microbes, their impact on host organisms, and author's speculation on how the symbiosis began.But the author repeats this template over and over again. A magazine story repeated twenty times. All these wonderful details remained details."

To finish it and gush about what I have learned, recommend it to my loved ones, and hear similarly great reviews. Buckle up. This is not that review. I did not enjoy this book. In fact, there were several moments that this felt like a punishment. Many of the chapters felt convoluted and meandering. I gained some fun parcels of knowledge. I can better appreciate how the microbiotic world impacts all of evolution. Amazing. Thinking about medicine as gardening instead of warfare? Meaningful. But, these bits of knowledge do not outweigh the book overall."

As an individual, you are not measured just by your mettle but by the mettle of your microbiome⁠—all the microbes collectively on and in your person. I Contain Multitudes boldly brings to your attention just how teeming the world and we are with invisible life.As some of the earliest forms of life on Earth, bacteria have developed diverse mechanisms and processes to survive on land, sea, and the most extreme environments. In the words of Yong, bacteria are ""metabolic wizards,"" now my new favorite way of describing how they can break down most anything: crude oil, plastics, plant material, you name it. In essence, if there's a way, you can bet there's a bacteria that has found it. Ed Yong's goal here is to dispel the overwhelming notion that bacteria are an evil to be eradicated, the infamous pathogens responsible for tuberculosis, cholera, tetanus, and the plague. Those bacteria are only a tiny drop in the bucket; there's a planet full of fascinating microbes that are harmless or, taking it a step further, essential for animal survival.The numerous examples which Yong provides of important symbiotic, or mutually beneficial, relationships between animal and bacteria demonstrate that such mutual coevolution simply cannot be ignored. Insects, squids, and yes, humans would find their immune defense and nutritional health wanting should the little microbes disappear. Mention about the scary Clostridium difficile, a bacteria that ravages the human gut when antibiotics clean out the healthy microbes within, hits close to home about the importance of recognizing the microbiome as a community, a vibrant ecosystem. There has only been a recent paradigm shift in recognizing both scientifically and medically that bacteria aren't solely organisms which ought to be nuked out of existence. On the flip side, that can lead to some overzealous claims about their benevolence (sorry, natural selection is still cranking away), but Yong is careful to point out when the data behind wild claims about bacterial miracles is just a little too shaky to trust. There's a lack of quantification for much of what Yong says, but I blame the state of the research field more than his skills as a science writer for a popular audience. He qualifies and admits the inherent weaknesses that a number of studies about the microbiome have; frankly, there is plenty of bad science out there. Instead, Yong chooses to look optimistically, to pique our attention towards the great potential for research results that are yet to be released. Though the information can become a little dense at times, Yong delivers a wide berth of information with easily digestible and dynamic language. At times, he writes with almost a childlike wonder at the biology, passionate about new discoveries and the future directions of research. Microbes are an undeniable part of each of us, and though Yong doesn't go full force towards heavy hitting questions about who we are, there is plenty of relevance to our lives and our worldview stocked in this book. Ultimately, I Contain Multitudes leaves us readers with our hopes raised for some incredible scientific advancements to be made with the proper lens—a lens zoomed into the microbes, that is."

Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes."" - Walt WhitmanI'm a priori inclined to like bacteria. My favorite is Oenococcus Oeni, even though that's not the only bacteria that causes the poorly-named malolactic fermentation during winemaking (malolactic conversion is better jargon, but I digress). No one really extols the virtues of super young red wine (I mean, besides those marketing masters in Beaujolais, but I'm firmly of the opinion that, if the terroir's worth tastin', skip the carbonic maceration). Straight out of the fermentation tank, red wine tastes like tart apples, which is not generally what you want. Introduce a little Oenococcus Oeni, and the apple taste softens up into butter. And I don't trust people who don't like butter.Northern California is apparently swarming with hippies, such as myself, who imagine that we're all interconnected cosmic beings embracing within a universal stew (or maybe cheese plate, we do a lot of wine and cheese up here, and I've been driving through redwoods for a few hours so it's a little hard for me to come up with a fitting metaphor). I Contain Multitudes is not only poetically written, but it deepens the feeling that we're all in this together. It's kind of like that episode of The Magic School Bus where the gang shrinks to the size of a blood cell and floats around the human body, but for educated grown ups who also listen to NPR. I recommend I Contain Multitudes, especially for people who want a more nuanced explanation of the hygiene hypothesis, fecal transplants, probiotics, and other bacteria-related stuff being reported in the news these days. Also recommended for stoners who want to think about the fact that we live in cities, but we also contain cities of bacteria, and the bacteria are floating in our bodies, and we're all fucking floating in space."
535,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5164471-geoffrey-benn,4,"“I Contain Multitudes,” is the first book by one of my favorite science journalists, Ed Yong. The focus of the book is microbiomes – the microbial ecosystems that exist on and in nearly every object on our planet (including us). Yong initially explores how scientific perceptions of the microbial world have changed from the first studies by Leeuwenhoek to the golden age of antibiotics to our microbiome-paper-a-day modern era and then jumps into ongoing microbiome research. The book is rich in excerpts from interviews with many leading scientists and covers a range of topics from the human microbiome to ecological consequences of altering microbial communities. As with Yong’s writing elsewhere, it is exciting and engaging while remaining rigorously factual and avoiding sensationalism. My one criticism is that the book lacked a strong over-arching narrative – it felt like I was jumping from one fascinating story to the next without a clear sense of direction. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in gaining a more nuanced understanding of the microbial world."

Ed Yong has captured a superb snapshot of a rapidly developing field. Microbes are not good or bad, as we used to be taught. They just are. Every animal, including us of course, is a dynamic ecosystem balancing countless species of bacteria plus viruses and other icky things. Microbes have evolved along with each other and animals in a balance that usually works best for everyone, because they were naturally selected to do so.Ed Yong writes so beautifully and naturally that you can gallop through this book with joy. His sly witticisms, stories, and elegant prose make a very complex subject understandable and consistently fascinating. And how refreshing it is to hear him say wee, poo, and squirting from its backside instead of pretending to be grown up with scientific Latinisms."

It was easy to see that he has a passion for the subject. His writing, at times, could be described as poetic. I can't pretend that I understood or will remember the majority of what he said but, it wasn't really that kind of book. This is a book that is meant to inspire the reader with a greater sense of wonder at the beauty and complexity of both our own bodies and of the world around us.I may just have to take a microbiology class at my local Jr College to gain a better understanding of the material this book covered."

I Contain Multitudes
. This book changed all of that. Starting with a short introduction to our history with the microorganisms we share our world with, to evaluating how our relationship with them have evolved over the decades, and filled with wonderfully curious and startling facts and discoveries not just about the microbes themselves, but of their roles in our health, development and future; several chapters into this book, I felt like I was seeing and thinking about microbes everywhere, in relation to everything. This book not only opened my eyes to the ubiquitous and brilliant nature of microbes, it gave me a newfound appreciation for the ones who cohabit my body – millions and millions of tiny little creatures that have turned me into a living, dynamic ecosystem. While having a basic understanding of microbiology did help make it easier to understand the information in this book, the language has been made accessible even to audiences without any scientific background. Ed Young has a true gift for writing – his strength lies in his ability to fashion clever, easily-comprehensible analogies in order to break down complex biological systems and theories. This book is also brimming with humour and passion. I particularly enjoyed the section at the end regarding synthetic biology and the potential for “microbial medicine” in our future. It completely changed my perspective on microorganisms, and I can’t recommend it enough."

550,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,4,"Microbes are a cultural novelty. We've only had a couple centuries to learn how to think about them, and all the metaphors we've developed in that time are based on some thin gropings in a world much older and more complex than we've realized until very recently. So part of Yong's goal is to introduce some of the research that brings us into that new world, and another part is to confront some of those metaphors and show how inadequate they are in light of that new evidence. There's not much of a thesis or a structure here; Yong is a great science writer and has covered a lot of research in articles, and this book feels like a series of those articles strung together around loosely related themes. A lot of that research is really amazing. I thought I was pretty hip to the microbiome stuff and had a sense of how important microbial ecology was. But there were still lots of revelations left for me here. The fundamental role of microbes in shaping animal development, for instance, or the enormous spectrum of what Wolbachia does in insect biology. There are two big ideas running through all of these stories. One is the extended phenotype: the idea that organisms inherit genes that code for their own bodies but also for compounds that shape the environment of other organisms. While Yong lets scientists waffle over the precise utility of the term ""hologenome"" for the genes of an organism and its symbionts (since the jobs must be done but often the organisms that do them can vary tremendously). But there are dozens of stories of particular organisms outsourcing development and maintenance work to their symbionts, and eventually even acquiring them as part of their own genome. The line between symbiont and host is blurred in a dozen different ways.The other idea, which is somewhat more profound if more obvious and intuitive in retrospect, is that microbial ecology isn't magic. It's subject to the same concepts we use to describe other ecological systems, if with some major differences in the particulars. I've had this vague notion that microbes are sort of everywhere, all the time, and that they can always find substrates as soon as they exist, that they can form dormant bodies that can tolerate extended periods without resources, etc. This seems to be an exaggeration; ultimately, microbial ecology functions just like plant ecology or insect ecology: the community present is determined by available propagules and environmental niches (available resources, competitors, temperature and pH, etc). This is where Yong's book left me wanting more. There are enough examples that this picture starts to become clear, but I'm wanting a more explicit statement of how these things work in the aggregate. Because the example systems he covers make it quite clear that microbial communities occupy, to a greater or lesser extent, pretty much every surface and volume we ever interact with. And we still seem to only have the faintest idea what any of that actually means--what they do, how they're determined, etc. Part of the problem here is that, again, while it may be feasible to take samples and use genetic analysis to characterize what's present, that doesn't really mean anything to us. It's easy for us to think in terms of animal metaphors, or landscapes, to grasp the impact of an invasive plant or the extinction of a major predator. We can visualize it, and all the players have some kind of innate personality. Even things that have names and a known role may simply do something completely different in another place. Maybe that work has been done (Wolbachia, for instance, seems to have a fairly wide knowledge base). But in the context of this book, there are some odd juxtapositions. Yong will talk about how important it is for us to have the right communities of gut microbiota, and how an organism isn't a pathogen or a mutualist except under the right circumstances. But then in other places he'll describe particular microbes as opportunistic and weedy species that thrive in over-cleaned environments and how this state is dysbiotic and unhealthy. I guess I'm just wanting to know more about particular pathogenic species now, which are presumably especially well-studied? "
551,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"Read this book if you are a doctor, nurse or public health official. Read this if you are an architect or botanist. Read this if you are very scared of germs and desire a sterile environment everywhere. This ground breaking book introduced to readers the world of microbiome, or world of microbes living inside other organisms. So there are bacteria everywhere on the surface and inside the gut of animals. They serve many critical functions: providing fluorescence for squids for camouflaging them from creatures below them. They live in termites’ stomach and digest wood fibres. They help kill pathogenic viruses and bacteria so protect the host. Breast milk provides food for benign gut bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis that protects us from diarrhoea. They secrete mucus lining our gut that enables virus (bacteriophages) that kills harmful bacteria! They co-evolve with their hosts. This symbiosis is not always benign, but is based on mutual advantage. Some animals hosts certain bacteria in the larval stage but discard them once they grow up to be adults. Even our own gut microbiome changes with time, sometimes within days. Animals growing up in a sterile environment behave strangely and are prone to funny diseases. Babies acquire their first microbiome in the mothers’ birth canal and thus normal birth is still better than caesarean section. Rampant antibiotic use destroys our diverse microbiome, allowing bad bugs to overgrow. Probiotics help but they cannot stay long in our gut. Animals routinely eat each other’s stools to acquire its microbiome. Some clostridium difficile bacteria are so resistant that no antibiotics can kill them. Fecal transplant (yes transfer of stools) have been used successfully to cure patients of clostridium infection and has been approved by FDA. Unfortunately the effects on other illnesses such as inflammatory bowel syndrome and autism has not been consistent so far. Furthermore, some do-it-yourself cases have ended in severe infection of the recipient. Another use of our new knowledge is in medicine. Filariasis is a sickness that causes very swollen feet and legs because of roundworm infection. When they are killed, Wolbachia bacteria inside is released, triggering inflammation and destruction of lymph nodes. So the legs get permanently swollen. Now doxycycline is used to kill the Wolbachia first, then the roundworms can be killed easily without problems. An exciting new use is the discovery that Wolbachia also renders the Aedes mosquitos less able to carry the horrible dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses. So Aedes mosquitos infected with Wolbachia have been released to the wild to displace the wild type mosquitos (because infected females preferentially mate with infected males) and dengue has been controlled. This was started in Australia called the World Mosquito Program, and is being carried out in countries such as Indonesia and Mexico. Counterintuitively, toilets that are more often scrubbed have more easily colonised by E. coli (stool bacteria that transmit gastroenteritis). A diverse microbiome allows other less vicious germs to proliferate and compete with E. coli. Hospitals are too clean thus allowing antibiotic resistant bugs to proliferate, causing nosocomial infections. Florence Nightingale had it right: opening hospital windows decrease those infections by allowing entry of a more diverse microbiome through those windows!A solid 5 star book!"

This was the perfect one!As a side note, the last year or so I've been crafting a ""microbiome diet"" for myself (originally, I thought of it more as an ""anti-inflammatory diet,"" with a high focus on anti-oxidants and various phytonutrients; meaning, lots of spices, and colorful fruits and vegetables). The main focus is to eat more plants, more variety of fiber (insoluble, soluble, resistant starch, inulin/prebiotics, etc), as well as common, traditional, probiotic foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, miso, kimchi, ""raw"" pickles, kombucha, etc). and even - counter-intuitively - some anti-bacterial foods (honey, hot peppers, grape seed extract, cinnamon, etc). I had heard of so many good correlations with having a healthy gut microbiome (reduced rates of cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, etc - as well as improved mood, mental health and possibly even IQ!), that I wanted to do something to support mine. But, the science is still pretty new, so I didn't want to do anything drastic. Eating ""healthier"" seemed like the most effective, least drastic thing I could do. Then I dropped 10 lbs and a pants size, which was totally unintentional, but I won't complain. Now I tell people that I accidentally discovered the secret to weight loss: Get your daily recommended serving of fiber! (For women, this is 25g, for men 30-37g).My recommended list of high fiber foods includes:Overnight Oats (Cocoa-PB, often with a banana)Chia Pudding (often with berries)Cocoa-Banana-Peanut Butter smoothieRoasted Chickpeas (simple seasoning: garlic/salt/cayenne)Pumpkin Seeds (in-shell)Okra Chips (Sprouts carries them)Edamame PastaGuacamoleWhole Grain BreadDark ChocolateFig Cake (Whole Foods sometimes carries this)Dark Chocolate Covered Figs (Safeway has them)Peetos (pea-based cheetos)Harvest Snaps (lentil-based puffs, Tomato Basil flavor)Avocado Sandwich (Avocado, sauerkraut, mustard, hot banana pepper rings, and smoked gouda toasted on whole grain bread)Apple Slices with Peanut ButterArtichokes (Google ""Magic Artichoke Dip"")AsparagusMushroomsLentils (TasyBite brand is good, and convenient)Meatless Crumbles (I like the Quorn brand, derived from mycelium)Nut Bars (Costco's Kirkland brand has 7g of fiber per bar, and is tasty)"

Working at a public library I handle dozens of book everyday, all of which were handled by a wide variety of peoples, and what this experience does is that it forces me to encounter ideas, perspectives, and reading habits I never would have experienced on my own. It also allows me to encounter a wide variety of microscopic organisms.Ed Yong's book is one of those beautiful love letters to science in which a writer is able to communicate their passion for the field of science. Not only this, Song is able to infect me with his passion by teaching me about the kinds of microbes that infect me on a regular basis. I Contain Multitudes is infectious though, because the passion is on every page, and by the end of this book I was spellbound by how multifaceted the study of microbiomes and microbes actually was. Like many people I thought of microbes as just germs, little organisms that existed solely to make me sick. In this book Yong got me to reconsider this position. Not only that, but Long got me to reconsider my own biology and realize that the little bugs were not just alien organisms living inside of me or on me, they were, in essence, part of me. Yong observes how an individual's microbes evolve in relation to their host, adapting or in some cases being adapted by said host. After a time it becomes clear to the reader that their microbes are not just alien organisms, but part of a long evolutionary lineage that has allowed them to become the incredible species they are today, and even when Yong is writing about the symbiosis between microbes and aphids, mosquitos, and dogs the reader constantly bombarded by his passion and his ability to see the significance of these relationships.There's so many great reasons to read this book, I'm just going to settle on the fact that the man made fecal transplants something both fascinating to read about, and also something I actually wanted to learn more about."
554,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33440429-ashish,4,"This book takes a look at the world that is lurking behind everything that we see, touch, smell and feel. It's in the food we eat, the ground we walk on, the house we live in and inside our body, in the millions. The microbes that comprise this world are capable of causing diseases but also give us medicines, they cause decay but also keep the natural cycle in place and so much more. The book is the author's love letter to this microbial world, and much like what Siddharth Mukherjee did for Cancer in ""Emperor of all Maladies"", he charters the historical and ever evolving (literally) place that they occupy in our world.The book deals with everything that we need to know about the microbial world. From how they came into existence, to the role that have played in terra forming earth as we know it, to their importance in modern medicine, the author doesn't leave any stone unturned to showcase their importance. The book is very well researched and references numerous studies to back up it's claims. Yong is clearly super passionate about this stuff and in this he might seem to oversell the product, but he exercises restraint, bringing in a dose of a reality check as he remains quite optimistic about some of the tremendously far reaching applications that microbes can have on us and the society. It draws from a number of fields as the reach of the microbial world is quite far, from the depth of the ocean a mile or more below the surface, to the coldest and hottest regions knows to man, to the human gut, to the insides of a termite, we get a broad outlook on the amount of research that has goes into and still does into them.A really good book, which could have been edited a little better to keep the pace up, but still managed to keep you hooked. It's a must read for nature lovers, for those interested in science and who want to stay informed about the possibilities that the future holds for mankind."
555,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4017921-mckenzie,4,"This is my kind of science book: an approachable introduction to a previously confusing specialty, taking its title from Walt Whitman of all places. Ed Yong sees the poetry in microbiology, and shares that vision with his readers while explaining the history of our understanding of bacteria, the surprising ways bacteria interact with their environments and hosts, and the medical possibilities as we come to understand our own microbiomes. While my interest in Yong's topic lagged during the sections focusing mostly on insects, the sections about the environment and human interactions were most fascinating for me. I learned, among other things, that human babies do not have the microbes they need to be healthy until they pass through the birth canal and are breastfed; that certain bacteria have been shown to counteract or prevent inflammation of the sort associated with multiple sclerosis, at least in mice; that fecal transplants are a real thing that doctors prescribe to reset the gut bacteria of people with certain diseases; and most excitingly, that we could be heading towards a future where doctors prescribe us bacteria concoctions to alleviate medical problems, the way they today prescribe antibiotics. If any of this interests you, you should read I Contain Multitudes. It's not quite on the same level of awe as Emperor of All Maladies, but considering that I've been walking around happily envisioning the trillions of bacteria I interact with every day at work, at home, with my cat, and with my friends, I'd say this is a book that can certainly teach anyone something, and change the way you view our natural world.

Maybe a few too many corny jokes, but even those are endearing. Biggest problem was the tremendous amount of vivisection described very cavalierly; this book is largely about the results of animal research and isn't remotely concerned with the ethics of that.Even the narrative mindset is way too human-centric for me. Example that made me boggle the most: frog-killing fungus epidemic is described as terrible for ""frog lovers"" rather than for terrible for frogs. Oh, many of the endnotes are well worth reading! Lots of little enlightening and entertaining tidbits mixed in with the drier stuff. "

I liked the book, but frankly it wasn't until the last three chapters that I found a narrative. Perhaps that is because I am less interested in a collection of facts about what we do and do not (more the latter than the former) about microbes, and more interested in how this translates into practical application. I wouldn't recommend listening to this one in audiobook. You will feel more like someone is reading you a list than someone is telling you about story, and thus I think it loses some of its wonder."

569,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Individuality is a cherished trait of sagacious beings. Man is the only such animal which is conscious of its self. Man stands alone in his mental transactions with the outside world. This aloofness is way off the true state of things. Very small microbes and other inanimate objects thrive in our body and are present in very large numbers on all our body parts. The presence of microbes is thought to be a bad thing in routine awareness sermons, but this is not necessarily so. Microbes are beneficial or neutral to us on most of the occasions and provide immense service to us. They keep our guts healthy, calibrate our immune systems, make us less sensitive to allergens and can even exert influence on our brains. This horde of microbes in our body makes each individual human being a multitude which acts in tandem to work as a symbiotic whole. Ed Yong is an award-winning science writer who regularly contributes to leading journals and scientific publications.The author makes a brilliant comparison scheme to present the contrast between life forms almost perennially lived on earth against others who are relatively latecomers to the party of life. He equates our planet’s entire life to a human year in which the present is just before midnight on December 31. On such a scale, the entry of humans was just half an hour ago, at 11.30 pm, while microbes ruled the globe between the months of March to October, that is, between their entry and the advent of higher organisms. This ingenuous example clarifies all doubts on the antiquity of microbes as compared to mammals or other higher forms of life.Microbes are everywhere, but due to the very small size of them, they remained invisible to mankind till the seventeenth century. It was then Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a pioneering lens-maker in Holland, witnessed these organisms everywhere – in water, in hand tools, in his body, home and everywhere! For a time, others couldn’t make lenses with the resolving power as Leeuwenhoek’s, but when at last they did, the scholars were shocked to find themselves colonized by these microbes. It took nearly another century to distinguish the good from the bad. Many microbes live in symbiosis with their hosts. It can also be said that microbes help us become what we are by modifying the genes of parent organisms in subtle ways. Biologists have experimentally demonstrated that organisms that live in sterile Lab-like environments where the microbes are strictly controlled suffer growth problems in the absence of friendly bacteria. Yong includes examples where the microbes affect the growth of brain. Specific strains of bacteria can be encouraged with the help of probiotics (the reverse process as antibiotics). Lack of exposure to symbiotic microbes had resulted in depression and anxiety in the hosts.The book argues that the sharp distinction between good and bad microbes is an oversimplification. Even the good ones create life-threatening situations when their position is changed, say from the gut to the blood stream. Mitochondria are present in every mammal cell, which generates the energy the cell so dearly needs. Scientists presume that mitochondria were independent microbes in the beginning of life and later settled inside the animal cell in a case of mutually beneficial symbiosis. Even with a history of living together for billions of years, if the mitochondrion is to enter the blood stream somehow, the immune system of the host attacks it with vigour as if it was a foreign particle and not a part of its own body. Yong presents the case of Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium in our gut that causes ulcer and stomach cancer. A very bad guy, obviously. But what will happen if we kill all of them in our guts? Scientists warn that we are in for more trouble, as these bacteria also protects against oesophageal cancer! As in life, it is a fine line that separates the good from the ugly in the case of microbes as well.The clever ways in which mothers help their babies grow microbes in their guts is interesting to read. The author has used many scientific terms to describe the process, but one such case is very noteworthy. Human breast milk contains a family of chemicals called Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO) which can’t be digested by the infant! Why on earth are such chemicals present in mother’s milk? The shocking answer is that these are good for a specific species of bacteria in the child’s long intestine. HMO nourishes these microbes, which in turn produces short-chain fatty acids. These feed the infant’s gut cells by making adhesive proteins that seal the gap between gut cells and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system. Needless to say, babies nurtured with bottled milk don’t develop this familiarity of the immune system to microbes. This results in inflammations where the immune system overreacts even to benign external particles. The book also speculates that microbes control obesity. Obese people have more Firmicutes and fewer Bacteroidetes than their leaner counterparts in their stomach. Transferring these microbes among lab mice showed that those mice which received microbes that characterized obesity put in more weight and vice versa. There is, however, no assurance that this result can be repeated in humans.Do you remember the scary day when New Scientist magazine trumpeted on its cover that Darwin was wrong? It talked about a system of gene transfer which is horizontal, that is, from one individual to another without any reproductive act called Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). This differed with the vertical scheme Darwin had in mind, that is, from parent to offspring. The devil was in the details, and if you had read the whole article, it emphasized Darwin’s theorem rather than upsetting it. But for those who judge a book by its cover, it presented an avoidable opportunity to score on the supposed ‘error’ in Darwinism. HGT is widely seen in the world of microbes. Yong presents the curious case of the ‘nori’ seaweed that is a delicacy in Japan. Humans normally can’t digest the seaweed as the gut bacteria are unable to process them. But those who ate them first ingested marine bacteria skilled in the job. It exchanged genes with normal gut bacteria and entered its genome. Then it proceeded to colonize people via the normal biome transfer between parent and child.In the latter chapters of the book, the author describes about several revolutionary techniques of healing with bacteria, which are generally interesting but revolting at times. The faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) techniques may provide a fast cure for stomach-related issues, but it shows that a microbiologist’s career is not always glamorous! Manipulating the microbiome of an entire region or a person is discussed at length, but Yong tactfully stops short of anticipating repercussions that may arise when one plays with an entire biome. If the author is to be believed – and there are many solid reasons to do so – microbes are definitely going to play a significant part in formulating the therapies of the future. The book is neatly written and displays the confidence of the author in the beneficence of what he describes to mankind. A number of colour plates add to the visual appeal. A good number of Notes and a comprehensive index enhance the utility of the book.The book is highly recommended."

I Contain Multitudes
. This book changed all of that. Starting with a short introduction to our history with the microorganisms we share our world with, to evaluating how our relationship with them have evolved over the decades, and filled with wonderfully curious and startling facts and discoveries not just about the microbes themselves, but of their roles in our health, development and future; several chapters into this book, I felt like I was seeing and thinking about microbes everywhere, in relation to everything. This book not only opened my eyes to the ubiquitous and brilliant nature of microbes, it gave me a newfound appreciation for the ones who cohabit my body – millions and millions of tiny little creatures that have turned me into a living, dynamic ecosystem. While having a basic understanding of microbiology did help make it easier to understand the information in this book, the language has been made accessible even to audiences without any scientific background. Ed Young has a true gift for writing – his strength lies in his ability to fashion clever, easily-comprehensible analogies in order to break down complex biological systems and theories. This book is also brimming with humour and passion. I particularly enjoyed the section at the end regarding synthetic biology and the potential for “microbial medicine” in our future.

580,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,4,"Microbes are a cultural novelty. We've only had a couple centuries to learn how to think about them, and all the metaphors we've developed in that time are based on some thin gropings in a world much older and more complex than we've realized until very recently. So part of Yong's goal is to introduce some of the research that brings us into that new world, and another part is to confront some of those metaphors and show how inadequate they are in light of that new evidence. There's not much of a thesis or a structure here; Yong is a great science writer and has covered a lot of research in articles, and this book feels like a series of those articles strung together around loosely related themes. A lot of that research is really amazing. I thought I was pretty hip to the microbiome stuff and had a sense of how important microbial ecology was. But there were still lots of revelations left for me here. The fundamental role of microbes in shaping animal development, for instance, or the enormous spectrum of what Wolbachia does in insect biology. There are two big ideas running through all of these stories. One is the extended phenotype: the idea that organisms inherit genes that code for their own bodies but also for compounds that shape the environment of other organisms. While Yong lets scientists waffle over the precise utility of the term ""hologenome"" for the genes of an organism and its symbionts (since the jobs must be done but often the organisms that do them can vary tremendously). But there are dozens of stories of particular organisms outsourcing development and maintenance work to their symbionts, and eventually even acquiring them as part of their own genome. The line between symbiont and host is blurred in a dozen different ways.The other idea, which is somewhat more profound if more obvious and intuitive in retrospect, is that microbial ecology isn't magic. It's subject to the same concepts we use to describe other ecological systems, if with some major differences in the particulars. I've had this vague notion that microbes are sort of everywhere, all the time, and that they can always find substrates as soon as they exist, that they can form dormant bodies that can tolerate extended periods without resources, etc. This seems to be an exaggeration; ultimately, microbial ecology functions just like plant ecology or insect ecology: the community present is determined by available propagules and environmental niches (available resources, competitors, temperature and pH, etc). This is where Yong's book left me wanting more. There are enough examples that this picture starts to become clear, but I'm wanting a more explicit statement of how these things work in the aggregate. Because the example systems he covers make it quite clear that microbial communities occupy, to a greater or lesser extent, pretty much every surface and volume we ever interact with. And we still seem to only have the faintest idea what any of that actually means--what they do, how they're determined, etc. Part of the problem here is that, again, while it may be feasible to take samples and use genetic analysis to characterize what's present, that doesn't really mean anything to us. It's easy for us to think in terms of animal metaphors, or landscapes, to grasp the impact of an invasive plant or the extinction of a major predator. We can visualize it, and all the players have some kind of innate personality. Even things that have names and a known role may simply do something completely different in another place. Maybe that work has been done (Wolbachia, for instance, seems to have a fairly wide knowledge base). But in the context of this book, there are some odd juxtapositions. Yong will talk about how important it is for us to have the right communities of gut microbiota, and how an organism isn't a pathogen or a mutualist except under the right circumstances. But then in other places he'll describe particular microbes as opportunistic and weedy species that thrive in over-cleaned environments and how this state is dysbiotic and unhealthy. I guess I'm just wanting to know more about particular pathogenic species now, which are presumably especially well-studied? "
581,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"Read this book if you are a doctor, nurse or public health official. Read this if you are an architect or botanist. Read this if you are very scared of germs and desire a sterile environment everywhere. This ground breaking book introduced to readers the world of microbiome, or world of microbes living inside other organisms. So there are bacteria everywhere on the surface and inside the gut of animals. They serve many critical functions: providing fluorescence for squids for camouflaging them from creatures below them. They live in termites’ stomach and digest wood fibres. They help kill pathogenic viruses and bacteria so protect the host. Breast milk provides food for benign gut bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis that protects us from diarrhoea. They secrete mucus lining our gut that enables virus (bacteriophages) that kills harmful bacteria! They co-evolve with their hosts. This symbiosis is not always benign, but is based on mutual advantage. Some animals hosts certain bacteria in the larval stage but discard them once they grow up to be adults. Even our own gut microbiome changes with time, sometimes within days. Animals growing up in a sterile environment behave strangely and are prone to funny diseases. Babies acquire their first microbiome in the mothers’ birth canal and thus normal birth is still better than caesarean section. Rampant antibiotic use destroys our diverse microbiome, allowing bad bugs to overgrow. Probiotics help but they cannot stay long in our gut. Animals routinely eat each other’s stools to acquire its microbiome. Some clostridium difficile bacteria are so resistant that no antibiotics can kill them. Fecal transplant (yes transfer of stools) have been used successfully to cure patients of clostridium infection and has been approved by FDA. Unfortunately the effects on other illnesses such as inflammatory bowel syndrome and autism has not been consistent so far. Furthermore, some do-it-yourself cases have ended in severe infection of the recipient. Another use of our new knowledge is in medicine. Filariasis is a sickness that causes very swollen feet and legs because of roundworm infection. When they are killed, Wolbachia bacteria inside is released, triggering inflammation and destruction of lymph nodes. So the legs get permanently swollen. Now doxycycline is used to kill the Wolbachia first, then the roundworms can be killed easily without problems. An exciting new use is the discovery that Wolbachia also renders the Aedes mosquitos less able to carry the horrible dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses. So Aedes mosquitos infected with Wolbachia have been released to the wild to displace the wild type mosquitos (because infected females preferentially mate with infected males) and dengue has been controlled. This was started in Australia called the World Mosquito Program, and is being carried out in countries such as Indonesia and Mexico. Counterintuitively, toilets that are more often scrubbed have more easily colonised by E. coli (stool bacteria that transmit gastroenteritis). A diverse microbiome allows other less vicious germs to proliferate and compete with E. coli. Hospitals are too clean thus allowing antibiotic resistant bugs to proliferate, causing nosocomial infections. Florence Nightingale had it right: opening hospital windows decrease those infections by allowing entry of a more diverse microbiome through those windows!A solid 5 star book!"

The main focus is to eat more plants, more variety of fiber (insoluble, soluble, resistant starch, inulin/prebiotics, etc), as well as common, traditional, probiotic foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, miso, kimchi, ""raw"" pickles, kombucha, etc). and even - counter-intuitively - some anti-bacterial foods (honey, hot peppers, grape seed extract, cinnamon, etc). I had heard of so many good correlations with having a healthy gut microbiome (reduced rates of cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, etc - as well as improved mood, mental health and possibly even IQ!), that I wanted to do something to support mine. But, the science is still pretty new, so I didn't want to do anything drastic. Eating ""healthier"" seemed like the most effective, least drastic thing I could do. Then I dropped 10 lbs and a pants size, which was totally unintentional, but I won't complain.

Working at a public library I handle dozens of book everyday, all of which were handled by a wide variety of peoples, and what this experience does is that it forces me to encounter ideas, perspectives, and reading habits I never would have experienced on my own. It also allows me to encounter a wide variety of microscopic organisms.Ed Yong's book is one of those beautiful love letters to science in which a writer is able to communicate their passion for the field of science. Not only this, Song is able to infect me with his passion by teaching me about the kinds of microbes that infect me on a regular basis. I Contain Multitudes is infectious though, because the passion is on every page, and by the end of this book I was spellbound by how multifaceted the study of microbiomes and microbes actually was. Like many people I thought of microbes as just germs, little organisms that existed solely to make me sick. In this book Yong got me to reconsider this position. Not only that, but Long got me to reconsider my own biology and realize that the little bugs were not just alien organisms living inside of me or on me, they were, in essence, part of me. Yong observes how an individual's microbes evolve in relation to their host, adapting or in some cases being adapted by said host. After a time it becomes clear to the reader that their microbes are not just alien organisms, but part of a long evolutionary lineage that has allowed them to become the incredible species they are today, and even when Yong is writing about the symbiosis between microbes and aphids, mosquitos, and dogs the reader constantly bombarded by his passion and his ability to see the significance of these relationships.There's so many great reasons to read this book, I'm just going to settle on the fact that the man made fecal transplants something both fascinating to read about, and also something I actually wanted to learn more about."
584,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33440429-ashish,4,"This book takes a look at the world that is lurking behind everything that we see, touch, smell and feel. It's in the food we eat, the ground we walk on, the house we live in and inside our body, in the millions. The microbes that comprise this world are capable of causing diseases but also give us medicines, they cause decay but also keep the natural cycle in place and so much more. The book is the author's love letter to this microbial world, and much like what Siddharth Mukherjee did for Cancer in ""Emperor of all Maladies"", he charters the historical and ever evolving (literally) place that they occupy in our world.The book deals with everything that we need to know about the microbial world. From how they came into existence, to the role that have played in terra forming earth as we know it, to their importance in modern medicine, the author doesn't leave any stone unturned to showcase their importance. The book is very well researched and references numerous studies to back up it's claims. Yong is clearly super passionate about this stuff and in this he might seem to oversell the product, but he exercises restraint, bringing in a dose of a reality check as he remains quite optimistic about some of the tremendously far reaching applications that microbes can have on us and the society. It draws from a number of fields as the reach of the microbial world is quite far, from the depth of the ocean a mile or more below the surface, to the coldest and hottest regions knows to man, to the human gut, to the insides of a termite, we get a broad outlook on the amount of research that has goes into and still does into them.A really good book, which could have been edited a little better to keep the pace up, but still managed to keep you hooked. It's a must read for nature lovers, for those interested in science and who want to stay informed about the possibilities that the future holds for mankind."
585,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4017921-mckenzie,4,"This is my kind of science book: an approachable introduction to a previously confusing specialty, taking its title from Walt Whitman of all places. Ed Yong sees the poetry in microbiology, and shares that vision with his readers while explaining the history of our understanding of bacteria, the surprising ways bacteria interact with their environments and hosts, and the medical possibilities as we come to understand our own microbiomes. While my interest in Yong's topic lagged during the sections focusing mostly on insects, the sections about the environment and human interactions were most fascinating for me. I learned, among other things, that human babies do not have the microbes they need to be healthy until they pass through the birth canal and are breastfed; that certain bacteria have been shown to counteract or prevent inflammation of the sort associated with multiple sclerosis, at least in mice; that fecal transplants are a real thing that doctors prescribe to reset the gut bacteria of people with certain diseases; and most excitingly, that we could be heading towards a future where doctors prescribe us bacteria concoctions to alleviate medical problems, the way they today prescribe antibiotics. If any of this interests you, you should read I Contain Multitudes. It's not quite on the same level of awe as Emperor of All Maladies, but considering that I've been walking around happily envisioning the trillions of bacteria I interact with every day at work, at home, with my cat, and with my friends, I'd say this is a book that can certainly teach anyone something, and change the way you view our natural world.

The other reviewers on Goodreads gave excellent overviews of this book. I could not add anything to match their erudite writings. Suffice to say, this book changed the way I looked at the world.

Maybe a few too many corny jokes, but even those are endearing. Biggest problem was the tremendous amount of vivisection described very cavalierly; this book is largely about the results of animal research and isn't remotely concerned with the ethics of that.Even the narrative mindset is way too human-centric for me. Example that made me boggle the most: frog-killing fungus epidemic is described as terrible for ""frog lovers"" rather than for terrible for frogs. Oh, many of the endnotes are well worth reading! Lots of little enlightening and entertaining tidbits mixed in with the drier stuff. "

I liked the book, but frankly it wasn't until the last three chapters that I found a narrative. Perhaps that is because I am less interested in a collection of facts about what we do and do not (more the latter than the former) about microbes, and more interested in how this translates into practical application. I wouldn't recommend listening to this one in audiobook. You will feel more like someone is reading you a list than someone is telling you about story, and thus I think it loses some of its wonder."

599,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Individuality is a cherished trait of sagacious beings. Man is the only such animal which is conscious of its self. Man stands alone in his mental transactions with the outside world. This aloofness is way off the true state of things. Very small microbes and other inanimate objects thrive in our body and are present in very large numbers on all our body parts. The presence of microbes is thought to be a bad thing in routine awareness sermons, but this is not necessarily so. Microbes are beneficial or neutral to us on most of the occasions and provide immense service to us. They keep our guts healthy, calibrate our immune systems, make us less sensitive to allergens and can even exert influence on our brains. This horde of microbes in our body makes each individual human being a multitude which acts in tandem to work as a symbiotic whole. Ed Yong is an award-winning science writer who regularly contributes to leading journals and scientific publications.The author makes a brilliant comparison scheme to present the contrast between life forms almost perennially lived on earth against others who are relatively latecomers to the party of life. He equates our planet’s entire life to a human year in which the present is just before midnight on December 31. On such a scale, the entry of humans was just half an hour ago, at 11.30 pm, while microbes ruled the globe between the months of March to October, that is, between their entry and the advent of higher organisms. This ingenuous example clarifies all doubts on the antiquity of microbes as compared to mammals or other higher forms of life.Microbes are everywhere, but due to the very small size of them, they remained invisible to mankind till the seventeenth century. It was then Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a pioneering lens-maker in Holland, witnessed these organisms everywhere – in water, in hand tools, in his body, home and everywhere! For a time, others couldn’t make lenses with the resolving power as Leeuwenhoek’s, but when at last they did, the scholars were shocked to find themselves colonized by these microbes. It took nearly another century to distinguish the good from the bad. Many microbes live in symbiosis with their hosts. It can also be said that microbes help us become what we are by modifying the genes of parent organisms in subtle ways. Biologists have experimentally demonstrated that organisms that live in sterile Lab-like environments where the microbes are strictly controlled suffer growth problems in the absence of friendly bacteria. Yong includes examples where the microbes affect the growth of brain. Specific strains of bacteria can be encouraged with the help of probiotics (the reverse process as antibiotics). Lack of exposure to symbiotic microbes had resulted in depression and anxiety in the hosts.The book argues that the sharp distinction between good and bad microbes is an oversimplification. Even the good ones create life-threatening situations when their position is changed, say from the gut to the blood stream. Mitochondria are present in every mammal cell, which generates the energy the cell so dearly needs. Scientists presume that mitochondria were independent microbes in the beginning of life and later settled inside the animal cell in a case of mutually beneficial symbiosis. Even with a history of living together for billions of years, if the mitochondrion is to enter the blood stream somehow, the immune system of the host attacks it with vigour as if it was a foreign particle and not a part of its own body. Yong presents the case of Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium in our gut that causes ulcer and stomach cancer. A very bad guy, obviously. But what will happen if we kill all of them in our guts? Scientists warn that we are in for more trouble, as these bacteria also protects against oesophageal cancer! As in life, it is a fine line that separates the good from the ugly in the case of microbes as well.The clever ways in which mothers help their babies grow microbes in their guts is interesting to read. The author has used many scientific terms to describe the process, but one such case is very noteworthy. Human breast milk contains a family of chemicals called Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO) which can’t be digested by the infant! Why on earth are such chemicals present in mother’s milk? The shocking answer is that these are good for a specific species of bacteria in the child’s long intestine. HMO nourishes these microbes, which in turn produces short-chain fatty acids. These feed the infant’s gut cells by making adhesive proteins that seal the gap between gut cells and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system. Needless to say, babies nurtured with bottled milk don’t develop this familiarity of the immune system to microbes. This results in inflammations where the immune system overreacts even to benign external particles. The book also speculates that microbes control obesity. Obese people have more Firmicutes and fewer Bacteroidetes than their leaner counterparts in their stomach. Transferring these microbes among lab mice showed that those mice which received microbes that characterized obesity put in more weight and vice versa. There is, however, no assurance that this result can be repeated in humans.Do you remember the scary day when New Scientist magazine trumpeted on its cover that Darwin was wrong? It talked about a system of gene transfer which is horizontal, that is, from one individual to another without any reproductive act called Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). This differed with the vertical scheme Darwin had in mind, that is, from parent to offspring. The devil was in the details, and if you had read the whole article, it emphasized Darwin’s theorem rather than upsetting it. But for those who judge a book by its cover, it presented an avoidable opportunity to score on the supposed ‘error’ in Darwinism. HGT is widely seen in the world of microbes. Yong presents the curious case of the ‘nori’ seaweed that is a delicacy in Japan. Humans normally can’t digest the seaweed as the gut bacteria are unable to process them. But those who ate them first ingested marine bacteria skilled in the job. It exchanged genes with normal gut bacteria and entered its genome. Then it proceeded to colonize people via the normal biome transfer between parent and child.In the latter chapters of the book, the author describes about several revolutionary techniques of healing with bacteria, which are generally interesting but revolting at times. The faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) techniques may provide a fast cure for stomach-related issues, but it shows that a microbiologist’s career is not always glamorous! Manipulating the microbiome of an entire region or a person is discussed at length, but Yong tactfully stops short of anticipating repercussions that may arise when one plays with an entire biome. If the author is to be believed – and there are many solid reasons to do so – microbes are definitely going to play a significant part in formulating the therapies of the future. The book is neatly written and displays the confidence of the author in the beneficence of what he describes to mankind. A number of colour plates add to the visual appeal. A good number of Notes and a comprehensive index enhance the utility of the book.The book is highly recommended."

I Contain Multitudes
. This book changed all of that. Starting with a short introduction to our history with the microorganisms we share our world with, to evaluating how our relationship with them have evolved over the decades, and filled with wonderfully curious and startling facts and discoveries not just about the microbes themselves, but of their roles in our health, development and future; several chapters into this book, I felt like I was seeing and thinking about microbes everywhere, in relation to everything. This book not only opened my eyes to the ubiquitous and brilliant nature of microbes, it gave me a newfound appreciation for the ones who cohabit my body – millions and millions of tiny little creatures that have turned me into a living, dynamic ecosystem. While having a basic understanding of microbiology did help make it easier to understand the information in this book, the language has been made accessible even to audiences without any scientific background. Ed Young has a true gift for writing – his strength lies in his ability to fashion clever, easily-comprehensible analogies in order to break down complex biological systems and theories. This book is also brimming with humour and passion. I particularly enjoyed the section at the end regarding synthetic biology and the potential for “microbial medicine” in our future.

610,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,4,"Microbes are a cultural novelty. We've only had a couple centuries to learn how to think about them, and all the metaphors we've developed in that time are based on some thin gropings in a world much older and more complex than we've realized until very recently. So part of Yong's goal is to introduce some of the research that brings us into that new world, and another part is to confront some of those metaphors and show how inadequate they are in light of that new evidence. There's not much of a thesis or a structure here; Yong is a great science writer and has covered a lot of research in articles, and this book feels like a series of those articles strung together around loosely related themes. A lot of that research is really amazing. I thought I was pretty hip to the microbiome stuff and had a sense of how important microbial ecology was. But there were still lots of revelations left for me here. The fundamental role of microbes in shaping animal development, for instance, or the enormous spectrum of what Wolbachia does in insect biology. There are two big ideas running through all of these stories. One is the extended phenotype: the idea that organisms inherit genes that code for their own bodies but also for compounds that shape the environment of other organisms. While Yong lets scientists waffle over the precise utility of the term ""hologenome"" for the genes of an organism and its symbionts (since the jobs must be done but often the organisms that do them can vary tremendously). But there are dozens of stories of particular organisms outsourcing development and maintenance work to their symbionts, and eventually even acquiring them as part of their own genome. The line between symbiont and host is blurred in a dozen different ways.The other idea, which is somewhat more profound if more obvious and intuitive in retrospect, is that microbial ecology isn't magic. It's subject to the same concepts we use to describe other ecological systems, if with some major differences in the particulars. I've had this vague notion that microbes are sort of everywhere, all the time, and that they can always find substrates as soon as they exist, that they can form dormant bodies that can tolerate extended periods without resources, etc. This seems to be an exaggeration; ultimately, microbial ecology functions just like plant ecology or insect ecology: the community present is determined by available propagules and environmental niches (available resources, competitors, temperature and pH, etc). This is where Yong's book left me wanting more. There are enough examples that this picture starts to become clear, but I'm wanting a more explicit statement of how these things work in the aggregate. Because the example systems he covers make it quite clear that microbial communities occupy, to a greater or lesser extent, pretty much every surface and volume we ever interact with. And we still seem to only have the faintest idea what any of that actually means--what they do, how they're determined, etc. Part of the problem here is that, again, while it may be feasible to take samples and use genetic analysis to characterize what's present, that doesn't really mean anything to us. It's easy for us to think in terms of animal metaphors, or landscapes, to grasp the impact of an invasive plant or the extinction of a major predator. We can visualize it, and all the players have some kind of innate personality. Even things that have names and a known role may simply do something completely different in another place. Maybe that work has been done (Wolbachia, for instance, seems to have a fairly wide knowledge base). But in the context of this book, there are some odd juxtapositions. Yong will talk about how important it is for us to have the right communities of gut microbiota, and how an organism isn't a pathogen or a mutualist except under the right circumstances. But then in other places he'll describe particular microbes as opportunistic and weedy species that thrive in over-cleaned environments and how this state is dysbiotic and unhealthy. I guess I'm just wanting to know more about particular pathogenic species now, which are presumably especially well-studied? "
611,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"Read this book if you are a doctor, nurse or public health official. Read this if you are an architect or botanist. Read this if you are very scared of germs and desire a sterile environment everywhere. This ground breaking book introduced to readers the world of microbiome, or world of microbes living inside other organisms. So there are bacteria everywhere on the surface and inside the gut of animals. They serve many critical functions: providing fluorescence for squids for camouflaging them from creatures below them. They live in termites’ stomach and digest wood fibres. They help kill pathogenic viruses and bacteria so protect the host. Breast milk provides food for benign gut bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis that protects us from diarrhoea. They secrete mucus lining our gut that enables virus (bacteriophages) that kills harmful bacteria! They co-evolve with their hosts. This symbiosis is not always benign, but is based on mutual advantage. Some animals hosts certain bacteria in the larval stage but discard them once they grow up to be adults. Even our own gut microbiome changes with time, sometimes within days. Animals growing up in a sterile environment behave strangely and are prone to funny diseases. Babies acquire their first microbiome in the mothers’ birth canal and thus normal birth is still better than caesarean section. Rampant antibiotic use destroys our diverse microbiome, allowing bad bugs to overgrow. Probiotics help but they cannot stay long in our gut. Animals routinely eat each other’s stools to acquire its microbiome. Some clostridium difficile bacteria are so resistant that no antibiotics can kill them. Fecal transplant (yes transfer of stools) have been used successfully to cure patients of clostridium infection and has been approved by FDA. Unfortunately the effects on other illnesses such as inflammatory bowel syndrome and autism has not been consistent so far. Furthermore, some do-it-yourself cases have ended in severe infection of the recipient. Another use of our new knowledge is in medicine. Filariasis is a sickness that causes very swollen feet and legs because of roundworm infection. When they are killed, Wolbachia bacteria inside is released, triggering inflammation and destruction of lymph nodes. So the legs get permanently swollen. Now doxycycline is used to kill the Wolbachia first, then the roundworms can be killed easily without problems. An exciting new use is the discovery that Wolbachia also renders the Aedes mosquitos less able to carry the horrible dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses. So Aedes mosquitos infected with Wolbachia have been released to the wild to displace the wild type mosquitos (because infected females preferentially mate with infected males) and dengue has been controlled. This was started in Australia called the World Mosquito Program, and is being carried out in countries such as Indonesia and Mexico. Counterintuitively, toilets that are more often scrubbed have more easily colonised by E. coli (stool bacteria that transmit gastroenteritis). A diverse microbiome allows other less vicious germs to proliferate and compete with E. coli. Hospitals are too clean thus allowing antibiotic resistant bugs to proliferate, causing nosocomial infections. Florence Nightingale had it right: opening hospital windows decrease those infections by allowing entry of a more diverse microbiome through those windows!A solid 5 star book!"

Working at a public library I handle dozens of book everyday, all of which were handled by a wide variety of peoples, and what this experience does is that it forces me to encounter ideas, perspectives, and reading habits I never would have experienced on my own. It also allows me to encounter a wide variety of microscopic organisms.Ed Yong's book is one of those beautiful love letters to science in which a writer is able to communicate their passion for the field of science. Not only this, Song is able to infect me with his passion by teaching me about the kinds of microbes that infect me on a regular basis. I Contain Multitudes is infectious though, because the passion is on every page, and by the end of this book I was spellbound by how multifaceted the study of microbiomes and microbes actually was. Like many people I thought of microbes as just germs, little organisms that existed solely to make me sick. In this book Yong got me to reconsider this position. Not only that, but Long got me to reconsider my own biology and realize that the little bugs were not just alien organisms living inside of me or on me, they were, in essence, part of me. Yong observes how an individual's microbes evolve in relation to their host, adapting or in some cases being adapted by said host. After a time it becomes clear to the reader that their microbes are not just alien organisms, but part of a long evolutionary lineage that has allowed them to become the incredible species they are today, and even when Yong is writing about the symbiosis between microbes and aphids, mosquitos, and dogs the reader constantly bombarded by his passion and his ability to see the significance of these relationships.There's so many great reasons to read this book, I'm just going to settle on the fact that the man made fecal transplants something both fascinating to read about, and also something I actually wanted to learn more about."
614,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33440429-ashish,4,"This book takes a look at the world that is lurking behind everything that we see, touch, smell and feel. It's in the food we eat, the ground we walk on, the house we live in and inside our body, in the millions. The microbes that comprise this world are capable of causing diseases but also give us medicines, they cause decay but also keep the natural cycle in place and so much more. The book is the author's love letter to this microbial world, and much like what Siddharth Mukherjee did for Cancer in ""Emperor of all Maladies"", he charters the historical and ever evolving (literally) place that they occupy in our world.The book deals with everything that we need to know about the microbial world. From how they came into existence, to the role that have played in terra forming earth as we know it, to their importance in modern medicine, the author doesn't leave any stone unturned to showcase their importance. The book is very well researched and references numerous studies to back up it's claims. Yong is clearly super passionate about this stuff and in this he might seem to oversell the product, but he exercises restraint, bringing in a dose of a reality check as he remains quite optimistic about some of the tremendously far reaching applications that microbes can have on us and the society. It draws from a number of fields as the reach of the microbial world is quite far, from the depth of the ocean a mile or more below the surface, to the coldest and hottest regions knows to man, to the human gut, to the insides of a termite, we get a broad outlook on the amount of research that has goes into and still does into them.A really good book, which could have been edited a little better to keep the pace up, but still managed to keep you hooked. It's a must read for nature lovers, for those interested in science and who want to stay informed about the possibilities that the future holds for mankind."
615,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4017921-mckenzie,4,"This is my kind of science book: an approachable introduction to a previously confusing specialty, taking its title from Walt Whitman of all places. Ed Yong sees the poetry in microbiology, and shares that vision with his readers while explaining the history of our understanding of bacteria, the surprising ways bacteria interact with their environments and hosts, and the medical possibilities as we come to understand our own microbiomes. While my interest in Yong's topic lagged during the sections focusing mostly on insects, the sections about the environment and human interactions were most fascinating for me. I learned, among other things, that human babies do not have the microbes they need to be healthy until they pass through the birth canal and are breastfed; that certain bacteria have been shown to counteract or prevent inflammation of the sort associated with multiple sclerosis, at least in mice; that fecal transplants are a real thing that doctors prescribe to reset the gut bacteria of people with certain diseases; and most excitingly, that we could be heading towards a future where doctors prescribe us bacteria concoctions to alleviate medical problems, the way they today prescribe antibiotics. If any of this interests you, you should read I Contain Multitudes. It's not quite on the same level of awe as Emperor of All Maladies, but considering that I've been walking around happily envisioning the trillions of bacteria I interact with every day at work, at home, with my cat, and with my friends, I'd say this is a book that can certainly teach anyone something, and change the way you view our natural world.

Maybe a few too many corny jokes, but even those are endearing. Biggest problem was the tremendous amount of vivisection described very cavalierly; this book is largely about the results of animal research and isn't remotely concerned with the ethics of that.Even the narrative mindset is way too human-centric for me. Example that made me boggle the most: frog-killing fungus epidemic is described as terrible for ""frog lovers"" rather than for terrible for frogs. Oh, many of the endnotes are well worth reading! Lots of little enlightening and entertaining tidbits mixed in with the drier stuff. "

I liked the book, but frankly it wasn't until the last three chapters that I found a narrative. Perhaps that is because I am less interested in a collection of facts about what we do and do not (more the latter than the former) about microbes, and more interested in how this translates into practical application. I wouldn't recommend listening to this one in audiobook. You will feel more like someone is reading you a list than someone is telling you about story, and thus I think it loses some of its wonder."

629,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Individuality is a cherished trait of sagacious beings. Man is the only such animal which is conscious of its self. Man stands alone in his mental transactions with the outside world. This aloofness is way off the true state of things. Very small microbes and other inanimate objects thrive in our body and are present in very large numbers on all our body parts. The presence of microbes is thought to be a bad thing in routine awareness sermons, but this is not necessarily so. Microbes are beneficial or neutral to us on most of the occasions and provide immense service to us. They keep our guts healthy, calibrate our immune systems, make us less sensitive to allergens and can even exert influence on our brains. This horde of microbes in our body makes each individual human being a multitude which acts in tandem to work as a symbiotic whole. Ed Yong is an award-winning science writer who regularly contributes to leading journals and scientific publications.The author makes a brilliant comparison scheme to present the contrast between life forms almost perennially lived on earth against others who are relatively latecomers to the party of life. He equates our planet’s entire life to a human year in which the present is just before midnight on December 31. On such a scale, the entry of humans was just half an hour ago, at 11.30 pm, while microbes ruled the globe between the months of March to October, that is, between their entry and the advent of higher organisms. This ingenuous example clarifies all doubts on the antiquity of microbes as compared to mammals or other higher forms of life.Microbes are everywhere, but due to the very small size of them, they remained invisible to mankind till the seventeenth century. It was then Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a pioneering lens-maker in Holland, witnessed these organisms everywhere – in water, in hand tools, in his body, home and everywhere! For a time, others couldn’t make lenses with the resolving power as Leeuwenhoek’s, but when at last they did, the scholars were shocked to find themselves colonized by these microbes. It took nearly another century to distinguish the good from the bad. Many microbes live in symbiosis with their hosts. It can also be said that microbes help us become what we are by modifying the genes of parent organisms in subtle ways. Biologists have experimentally demonstrated that organisms that live in sterile Lab-like environments where the microbes are strictly controlled suffer growth problems in the absence of friendly bacteria. Yong includes examples where the microbes affect the growth of brain. Specific strains of bacteria can be encouraged with the help of probiotics (the reverse process as antibiotics). Lack of exposure to symbiotic microbes had resulted in depression and anxiety in the hosts.The book argues that the sharp distinction between good and bad microbes is an oversimplification. Even the good ones create life-threatening situations when their position is changed, say from the gut to the blood stream. Mitochondria are present in every mammal cell, which generates the energy the cell so dearly needs. Scientists presume that mitochondria were independent microbes in the beginning of life and later settled inside the animal cell in a case of mutually beneficial symbiosis. Even with a history of living together for billions of years, if the mitochondrion is to enter the blood stream somehow, the immune system of the host attacks it with vigour as if it was a foreign particle and not a part of its own body. Yong presents the case of Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium in our gut that causes ulcer and stomach cancer. A very bad guy, obviously. But what will happen if we kill all of them in our guts? Scientists warn that we are in for more trouble, as these bacteria also protects against oesophageal cancer! As in life, it is a fine line that separates the good from the ugly in the case of microbes as well.The clever ways in which mothers help their babies grow microbes in their guts is interesting to read. The author has used many scientific terms to describe the process, but one such case is very noteworthy. Human breast milk contains a family of chemicals called Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO) which can’t be digested by the infant! Why on earth are such chemicals present in mother’s milk? The shocking answer is that these are good for a specific species of bacteria in the child’s long intestine. HMO nourishes these microbes, which in turn produces short-chain fatty acids. These feed the infant’s gut cells by making adhesive proteins that seal the gap between gut cells and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system. Needless to say, babies nurtured with bottled milk don’t develop this familiarity of the immune system to microbes. This results in inflammations where the immune system overreacts even to benign external particles. The book also speculates that microbes control obesity. Obese people have more Firmicutes and fewer Bacteroidetes than their leaner counterparts in their stomach. Transferring these microbes among lab mice showed that those mice which received microbes that characterized obesity put in more weight and vice versa. There is, however, no assurance that this result can be repeated in humans.Do you remember the scary day when New Scientist magazine trumpeted on its cover that Darwin was wrong? It talked about a system of gene transfer which is horizontal, that is, from one individual to another without any reproductive act called Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). This differed with the vertical scheme Darwin had in mind, that is, from parent to offspring. The devil was in the details, and if you had read the whole article, it emphasized Darwin’s theorem rather than upsetting it. But for those who judge a book by its cover, it presented an avoidable opportunity to score on the supposed ‘error’ in Darwinism. HGT is widely seen in the world of microbes. Yong presents the curious case of the ‘nori’ seaweed that is a delicacy in Japan. Humans normally can’t digest the seaweed as the gut bacteria are unable to process them. But those who ate them first ingested marine bacteria skilled in the job. It exchanged genes with normal gut bacteria and entered its genome. Then it proceeded to colonize people via the normal biome transfer between parent and child.In the latter chapters of the book, the author describes about several revolutionary techniques of healing with bacteria, which are generally interesting but revolting at times. The faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) techniques may provide a fast cure for stomach-related issues, but it shows that a microbiologist’s career is not always glamorous! Manipulating the microbiome of an entire region or a person is discussed at length, but Yong tactfully stops short of anticipating repercussions that may arise when one plays with an entire biome. If the author is to be believed – and there are many solid reasons to do so – microbes are definitely going to play a significant part in formulating the therapies of the future. The book is neatly written and displays the confidence of the author in the beneficence of what he describes to mankind. A number of colour plates add to the visual appeal. A good number of Notes and a comprehensive index enhance the utility of the book.The book is highly recommended."

I Contain Multitudes
. This book changed all of that. Starting with a short introduction to our history with the microorganisms we share our world with, to evaluating how our relationship with them have evolved over the decades, and filled with wonderfully curious and startling facts and discoveries not just about the microbes themselves, but of their roles in our health, development and future; several chapters into this book, I felt like I was seeing and thinking about microbes everywhere, in relation to everything. This book not only opened my eyes to the ubiquitous and brilliant nature of microbes, it gave me a newfound appreciation for the ones who cohabit my body – millions and millions of tiny little creatures that have turned me into a living, dynamic ecosystem. While having a basic understanding of microbiology did help make it easier to understand the information in this book, the language has been made accessible even to audiences without any scientific background. Ed Young has a true gift for writing – his strength lies in his ability to fashion clever, easily-comprehensible analogies in order to break down complex biological systems and theories. This book is also brimming with humour and passion. I particularly enjoyed the section at the end regarding synthetic biology and the potential for “microbial medicine” in our future.

640,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,4,"Microbes are a cultural novelty. We've only had a couple centuries to learn how to think about them, and all the metaphors we've developed in that time are based on some thin gropings in a world much older and more complex than we've realized until very recently. So part of Yong's goal is to introduce some of the research that brings us into that new world, and another part is to confront some of those metaphors and show how inadequate they are in light of that new evidence. There's not much of a thesis or a structure here; Yong is a great science writer and has covered a lot of research in articles, and this book feels like a series of those articles strung together around loosely related themes. A lot of that research is really amazing. I thought I was pretty hip to the microbiome stuff and had a sense of how important microbial ecology was. But there were still lots of revelations left for me here. The fundamental role of microbes in shaping animal development, for instance, or the enormous spectrum of what Wolbachia does in insect biology. There are two big ideas running through all of these stories. One is the extended phenotype: the idea that organisms inherit genes that code for their own bodies but also for compounds that shape the environment of other organisms. While Yong lets scientists waffle over the precise utility of the term ""hologenome"" for the genes of an organism and its symbionts (since the jobs must be done but often the organisms that do them can vary tremendously). But there are dozens of stories of particular organisms outsourcing development and maintenance work to their symbionts, and eventually even acquiring them as part of their own genome. The line between symbiont and host is blurred in a dozen different ways.The other idea, which is somewhat more profound if more obvious and intuitive in retrospect, is that microbial ecology isn't magic. It's subject to the same concepts we use to describe other ecological systems, if with some major differences in the particulars. I've had this vague notion that microbes are sort of everywhere, all the time, and that they can always find substrates as soon as they exist, that they can form dormant bodies that can tolerate extended periods without resources, etc. This seems to be an exaggeration; ultimately, microbial ecology functions just like plant ecology or insect ecology: the community present is determined by available propagules and environmental niches (available resources, competitors, temperature and pH, etc). This is where Yong's book left me wanting more. There are enough examples that this picture starts to become clear, but I'm wanting a more explicit statement of how these things work in the aggregate. Because the example systems he covers make it quite clear that microbial communities occupy, to a greater or lesser extent, pretty much every surface and volume we ever interact with. And we still seem to only have the faintest idea what any of that actually means--what they do, how they're determined, etc. Part of the problem here is that, again, while it may be feasible to take samples and use genetic analysis to characterize what's present, that doesn't really mean anything to us. It's easy for us to think in terms of animal metaphors, or landscapes, to grasp the impact of an invasive plant or the extinction of a major predator. We can visualize it, and all the players have some kind of innate personality. Even things that have names and a known role may simply do something completely different in another place. Maybe that work has been done (Wolbachia, for instance, seems to have a fairly wide knowledge base). But in the context of this book, there are some odd juxtapositions. Yong will talk about how important it is for us to have the right communities of gut microbiota, and how an organism isn't a pathogen or a mutualist except under the right circumstances. But then in other places he'll describe particular microbes as opportunistic and weedy species that thrive in over-cleaned environments and how this state is dysbiotic and unhealthy. I guess I'm just wanting to know more about particular pathogenic species now, which are presumably especially well-studied? "
641,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"Read this book if you are a doctor, nurse or public health official. Read this if you are an architect or botanist. Read this if you are very scared of germs and desire a sterile environment everywhere. This ground breaking book introduced to readers the world of microbiome, or world of microbes living inside other organisms. So there are bacteria everywhere on the surface and inside the gut of animals. They serve many critical functions: providing fluorescence for squids for camouflaging them from creatures below them. They live in termites’ stomach and digest wood fibres. They help kill pathogenic viruses and bacteria so protect the host. Breast milk provides food for benign gut bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis that protects us from diarrhoea. They secrete mucus lining our gut that enables virus (bacteriophages) that kills harmful bacteria! They co-evolve with their hosts. This symbiosis is not always benign, but is based on mutual advantage. Some animals hosts certain bacteria in the larval stage but discard them once they grow up to be adults. Even our own gut microbiome changes with time, sometimes within days. Animals growing up in a sterile environment behave strangely and are prone to funny diseases. Babies acquire their first microbiome in the mothers’ birth canal and thus normal birth is still better than caesarean section. Rampant antibiotic use destroys our diverse microbiome, allowing bad bugs to overgrow. Probiotics help but they cannot stay long in our gut. Animals routinely eat each other’s stools to acquire its microbiome. Some clostridium difficile bacteria are so resistant that no antibiotics can kill them. Fecal transplant (yes transfer of stools) have been used successfully to cure patients of clostridium infection and has been approved by FDA. Unfortunately the effects on other illnesses such as inflammatory bowel syndrome and autism has not been consistent so far. Furthermore, some do-it-yourself cases have ended in severe infection of the recipient. Another use of our new knowledge is in medicine. Filariasis is a sickness that causes very swollen feet and legs because of roundworm infection. When they are killed, Wolbachia bacteria inside is released, triggering inflammation and destruction of lymph nodes. So the legs get permanently swollen. Now doxycycline is used to kill the Wolbachia first, then the roundworms can be killed easily without problems. An exciting new use is the discovery that Wolbachia also renders the Aedes mosquitos less able to carry the horrible dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses. So Aedes mosquitos infected with Wolbachia have been released to the wild to displace the wild type mosquitos (because infected females preferentially mate with infected males) and dengue has been controlled. This was started in Australia called the World Mosquito Program, and is being carried out in countries such as Indonesia and Mexico. Counterintuitively, toilets that are more often scrubbed have more easily colonised by E. coli (stool bacteria that transmit gastroenteritis). A diverse microbiome allows other less vicious germs to proliferate and compete with E. coli. Hospitals are too clean thus allowing antibiotic resistant bugs to proliferate, causing nosocomial infections. Florence Nightingale had it right: opening hospital windows decrease those infections by allowing entry of a more diverse microbiome through those windows!A solid 5 star book!"

This was the perfect one!As a side note, the last year or so I've been crafting a ""microbiome diet"" for myself (originally, I thought of it more as an ""anti-inflammatory diet,"" with a high focus on anti-oxidants and various phytonutrients; meaning, lots of spices, and colorful fruits and vegetables). The main focus is to eat more plants, more variety of fiber (insoluble, soluble, resistant starch, inulin/prebiotics, etc), as well as common, traditional, probiotic foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, miso, kimchi, ""raw"" pickles, kombucha, etc). and even - counter-intuitively - some anti-bacterial foods (honey, hot peppers, grape seed extract, cinnamon, etc).

Working at a public library I handle dozens of book everyday, all of which were handled by a wide variety of peoples, and what this experience does is that it forces me to encounter ideas, perspectives, and reading habits I never would have experienced on my own. It also allows me to encounter a wide variety of microscopic organisms.Ed Yong's book is one of those beautiful love letters to science in which a writer is able to communicate their passion for the field of science. Not only this, Song is able to infect me with his passion by teaching me about the kinds of microbes that infect me on a regular basis. I Contain Multitudes is infectious though, because the passion is on every page, and by the end of this book I was spellbound by how multifaceted the study of microbiomes and microbes actually was. Like many people I thought of microbes as just germs, little organisms that existed solely to make me sick. In this book Yong got me to reconsider this position. Not only that, but Long got me to reconsider my own biology and realize that the little bugs were not just alien organisms living inside of me or on me, they were, in essence, part of me. Yong observes how an individual's microbes evolve in relation to their host, adapting or in some cases being adapted by said host. After a time it becomes clear to the reader that their microbes are not just alien organisms, but part of a long evolutionary lineage that has allowed them to become the incredible species they are today, and even when Yong is writing about the symbiosis between microbes and aphids, mosquitos, and dogs the reader constantly bombarded by his passion and his ability to see the significance of these relationships.There's so many great reasons to read this book, I'm just going to settle on the fact that the man made fecal transplants something both fascinating to read about, and also something I actually wanted to learn more about."
644,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33440429-ashish,4,"This book takes a look at the world that is lurking behind everything that we see, touch, smell and feel. It's in the food we eat, the ground we walk on, the house we live in and inside our body, in the millions. The microbes that comprise this world are capable of causing diseases but also give us medicines, they cause decay but also keep the natural cycle in place and so much more. The book is the author's love letter to this microbial world, and much like what Siddharth Mukherjee did for Cancer in ""Emperor of all Maladies"", he charters the historical and ever evolving (literally) place that they occupy in our world.The book deals with everything that we need to know about the microbial world. From how they came into existence, to the role that have played in terra forming earth as we know it, to their importance in modern medicine, the author doesn't leave any stone unturned to showcase their importance. The book is very well researched and references numerous studies to back up it's claims. Yong is clearly super passionate about this stuff and in this he might seem to oversell the product, but he exercises restraint, bringing in a dose of a reality check as he remains quite optimistic about some of the tremendously far reaching applications that microbes can have on us and the society. It draws from a number of fields as the reach of the microbial world is quite far, from the depth of the ocean a mile or more below the surface, to the coldest and hottest regions knows to man, to the human gut, to the insides of a termite, we get a broad outlook on the amount of research that has goes into and still does into them.A really good book, which could have been edited a little better to keep the pace up, but still managed to keep you hooked. It's a must read for nature lovers, for those interested in science and who want to stay informed about the possibilities that the future holds for mankind."
645,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4017921-mckenzie,4,"This is my kind of science book: an approachable introduction to a previously confusing specialty, taking its title from Walt Whitman of all places. Ed Yong sees the poetry in microbiology, and shares that vision with his readers while explaining the history of our understanding of bacteria, the surprising ways bacteria interact with their environments and hosts, and the medical possibilities as we come to understand our own microbiomes. While my interest in Yong's topic lagged during the sections focusing mostly on insects, the sections about the environment and human interactions were most fascinating for me. I learned, among other things, that human babies do not have the microbes they need to be healthy until they pass through the birth canal and are breastfed; that certain bacteria have been shown to counteract or prevent inflammation of the sort associated with multiple sclerosis, at least in mice; that fecal transplants are a real thing that doctors prescribe to reset the gut bacteria of people with certain diseases; and most excitingly, that we could be heading towards a future where doctors prescribe us bacteria concoctions to alleviate medical problems, the way they today prescribe antibiotics. If any of this interests you, you should read I Contain Multitudes. It's not quite on the same level of awe as Emperor of All Maladies, but considering that I've been walking around happily envisioning the trillions of bacteria I interact with every day at work, at home, with my cat, and with my friends, I'd say this is a book that can certainly teach anyone something, and change the way you view our natural world.

The other reviewers on Goodreads gave excellent overviews of this book. I could not add anything to match their erudite writings. Suffice to say, this book changed the way I looked at the world.

Maybe a few too many corny jokes, but even those are endearing. Biggest problem was the tremendous amount of vivisection described very cavalierly; this book is largely about the results of animal research and isn't remotely concerned with the ethics of that.Even the narrative mindset is way too human-centric for me. Example that made me boggle the most: frog-killing fungus epidemic is described as terrible for ""frog lovers"" rather than for terrible for frogs. Oh, many of the endnotes are well worth reading! Lots of little enlightening and entertaining tidbits mixed in with the drier stuff. "

I liked the book, but frankly it wasn't until the last three chapters that I found a narrative. Perhaps that is because I am less interested in a collection of facts about what we do and do not (more the latter than the former) about microbes, and more interested in how this translates into practical application. I wouldn't recommend listening to this one in audiobook. You will feel more like someone is reading you a list than someone is telling you about story, and thus I think it loses some of its wonder."

Man stands alone in his mental transactions with the outside world. This aloofness is way off the true state of things. Very small microbes and other inanimate objects thrive in our body and are present in very large numbers on all our body parts. The presence of microbes is thought to be a bad thing in routine awareness sermons, but this is not necessarily so. Microbes are beneficial or neutral to us on most of the occasions and provide immense service to us. They keep our guts healthy, calibrate our immune systems, make us less sensitive to allergens and can even exert influence on our brains. This horde of microbes in our body makes each individual human being a multitude which acts in tandem to work as a symbiotic whole. Ed Yong is an award-winning science writer who regularly contributes to leading journals and scientific publications.The author makes a brilliant comparison scheme to present the contrast between life forms almost perennially lived on earth against others who are relatively latecomers to the party of life. He equates our planet’s entire life to a human year in which the present is just before midnight on December 31. On such a scale, the entry of humans was just half an hour ago, at 11.30 pm, while microbes ruled the globe between the months of March to October, that is, between their entry and the advent of higher organisms. This ingenuous example clarifies all doubts on the antiquity of microbes as compared to mammals or other higher forms of life.Microbes are everywhere, but due to the very small size of them, they remained invisible to mankind till the seventeenth century. It was then Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a pioneering lens-maker in Holland, witnessed these organisms everywhere – in water, in hand tools, in his body, home and everywhere! For a time, others couldn’t make lenses with the resolving power as Leeuwenhoek’s, but when at last they did, the scholars were shocked to find themselves colonized by these microbes. It took nearly another century to distinguish the good from the bad. Many microbes live in symbiosis with their hosts. It can also be said that microbes help us become what we are by modifying the genes of parent organisms in subtle ways. Biologists have experimentally demonstrated that organisms that live in sterile Lab-like environments where the microbes are strictly controlled suffer growth problems in the absence of friendly bacteria. Yong includes examples where the microbes affect the growth of brain. Specific strains of bacteria can be encouraged with the help of probiotics (the reverse process as antibiotics). Lack of exposure to symbiotic microbes had resulted in depression and anxiety in the hosts.The book argues that the sharp distinction between good and bad microbes is an oversimplification. Even the good ones create life-threatening situations when their position is changed, say from the gut to the blood stream. Mitochondria are present in every mammal cell, which generates the energy the cell so dearly needs. Scientists presume that mitochondria were independent microbes in the beginning of life and later settled inside the animal cell in a case of mutually beneficial symbiosis. Even with a history of living together for billions of years, if the mitochondrion is to enter the blood stream somehow, the immune system of the host attacks it with vigour as if it was a foreign particle and not a part of its own body. Yong presents the case of Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium in our gut that causes ulcer and stomach cancer. A very bad guy, obviously. But what will happen if we kill all of them in our guts? Scientists warn that we are in for more trouble, as these bacteria also protects against oesophageal cancer! As in life, it is a fine line that separates the good from the ugly in the case of microbes as well.The clever ways in which mothers help their babies grow microbes in their guts is interesting to read. The author has used many scientific terms to describe the process, but one such case is very noteworthy. Human breast milk contains a family of chemicals called Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO) which can’t be digested by the infant! Why on earth are such chemicals present in mother’s milk? The shocking answer is that these are good for a specific species of bacteria in the child’s long intestine. HMO nourishes these microbes, which in turn produces short-chain fatty acids. These feed the infant’s gut cells by making adhesive proteins that seal the gap between gut cells and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system. Needless to say, babies nurtured with bottled milk don’t develop this familiarity of the immune system to microbes. This results in inflammations where the immune system overreacts even to benign external particles. The book also speculates that microbes control obesity. Obese people have more Firmicutes and fewer Bacteroidetes than their leaner counterparts in their stomach. Transferring these microbes among lab mice showed that those mice which received microbes that characterized obesity put in more weight and vice versa. There is, however, no assurance that this result can be repeated in humans.Do you remember the scary day when New Scientist magazine trumpeted on its cover that Darwin was wrong? It talked about a system of gene transfer which is horizontal, that is, from one individual to another without any reproductive act called Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). This differed with the vertical scheme Darwin had in mind, that is, from parent to offspring. The devil was in the details, and if you had read the whole article, it emphasized Darwin’s theorem rather than upsetting it. But for those who judge a book by its cover, it presented an avoidable opportunity to score on the supposed ‘error’ in Darwinism. HGT is widely seen in the world of microbes. Yong presents the curious case of the ‘nori’ seaweed that is a delicacy in Japan. Humans normally can’t digest the seaweed as the gut bacteria are unable to process them. But those who ate them first ingested marine bacteria skilled in the job. It exchanged genes with normal gut bacteria and entered its genome. Then it proceeded to colonize people via the normal biome transfer between parent and child.In the latter chapters of the book, the author describes about several revolutionary techniques of healing with bacteria, which are generally interesting but revolting at times. The faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) techniques may provide a fast cure for stomach-related issues, but it shows that a microbiologist’s career is not always glamorous! Manipulating the microbiome of an entire region or a person is discussed at length, but Yong tactfully stops short of anticipating repercussions that may arise when one plays with an entire biome. If the author is to be believed – and there are many solid reasons to do so – microbes are definitely going to play a significant part in formulating the therapies of the future. The book is neatly written and displays the confidence of the author in the beneficence of what he describes to mankind. A number of colour plates add to the visual appeal. A good number of Notes and a comprehensive index enhance the utility of the book.The book is highly recommended."
660,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"If you’ve already read books like Martin Blaser’s Missing Microbes, a lot of this info won’t be new to you. However, Ed Yong’s enthusiasm and wider range — dipping into the microbes of other animals and even insects — is a joy. He also provides a counterpoint to some of Blaser’s more hysterical ideas about the loss of microbes. He agrees that microbes are important, and that our relationships with them are complex. But he doesn’t accept that we’re totally doomed. There’s tons of research into repopulating our guts with beneficial microbes, prebiotics and probiotics. No doubt things are in the pipeline which will make a difference.Yong is significantly less hopeful about the potential of procedures like faecal transplants — though the results have been encouraging in cases of C. difficile infections, the potential for treating inflammatory bowel disease seems more limited. It’s not impossible that a refined version of faecal transplants can help to rebalance the irritated and inflamed gut systems of people who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases… but so far, the data isn’t there.With his enthusiasm and interest, Yong makes me want to hurry the heck up, get my biology degree, and get stuck into researching on exactly these topics. One thing is for sure: our microbiome is incredibly important, and we need more research. Our gut microbes can affect our overall health in so many ways — mental health included — that I foresee a lot more time being spent on this in labs in the near future. And I hope I’ll be one of the people working in one of those labs.If you don’t know much about microbes, fear not: Yong’s writing is clear and accessible, with no technobabble.

It's not that I don't want to learn about the bacteria on and in bugs and hyenas and such, but I read this book, hoping to learn more about how microbes affect humans, positively and/or negatively. I was hoping for more discussion of pathogens and illness. That's just where my fascination lies. Yong says in the Afterword that his goal in writing this book was to look at the microbiome as a whole and NOT focus on humans, so he did a great job of that. He makes it clear that bacteria are important to all life, not just to humans. Because, after all, there was life way before we humans were created, and there are many more non-human creatures than human ones on our planet. Besides, it's a more holistic view of life, a ""grander view,"" if you will, than we usually have. I recommend this book because it's eyeopening and educational. I learned a lot about microbes but also about life in general. It's funny and interesting. Yong has a unique voice, complete with corny jokes and wording, which makes this book about microbes accessible to anyone with an interest in the subject. My dad and I read this book together.

Naturally, I will draw parallels.Ed Yong's goal in this book appears to be proving that our symbiosis with microbes is rooted in our origins, and while many commercial products might tell us otherwise, is absolutely necessary for our healthy lives. From the very first signs of life billions of years ago to modern day, microbes have essentially been dictating the rules by which complex beings evolve, absorb nutrients, battle toxins, and communicate with others. It is not always an easy coexistence, but like a pair of old roommates, we learn to feed off each other's best qualities.Read the rest of the review on: Chaika Books"

665,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116660907-brian,5,"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life by Ed Yong dives into the wonderful and often misunderstood field of microbiology. Yong will unravel discoveries and knock down conspiracies — all while talking about microbes! Microbes will never be the same once you have read this book. The myriad microbes in our bodies are collectively known as the microbiome or microbiota. Microbes are a big part of our lives. According to Yong, our oxygen is produced by photosynthetic microbes in the ocean and the bacteria in chloroplasts (we would not be here without them!). Though most cast microbes as antagonists, ""[t]here are fewer than 100 species of bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans""(11). Our microbes also supplement our body cells. It carries a whopping 500 times more genes than your cells. What your body cells cannot do, your microbes are most likely capable of.  We then dive into a crash course on microbiology's history. While looking through his microscope, the famous lens maker, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, found vast populations of microbes which he christened ""animalcules."" The field of microbiology made no significant advances until the nineteenth century, when Louis Pasteur proposed that microbes could be the agents of disease. Before then, disease was thought to be ""caused by bad air, or miasma, released from rotting matter""(32). Another breakthrough was seen when Joseph Lister introduced the use of antiseptic for medical purposes. The classification of microbes was enhanced by Carl Woese. In different bacterial samples, he found a common molecule called 16S rRNA. A discovery was made when Woese studied methanogens: ""when he looked at its 16S rRNA, he realized it was decidedly un-bacterial""(41). The methanogens were later reclassified as archaea. What marked this as a monumental step for biology in general was Woese's method of ""comparing genes to work out how species are related to each other""(41). This opened the path to metagenomics. Later scientist were able to ""extract the DNA from all local microbes, cut it into small fragments, and sequence them together""(43).  According to tests done on sterilized mice, ""microbes activated a wide range of mouse genes"" and ""told them how to use their own genes to make a healthy gut""(54). Microbes also ""stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cells, while others induce dove-like anti-inflammatory cells … they allow us to react to threats without overreacting""(64). Without this equilibrium, we would not be able to respond to harmful threats while overreacting to harmless one. Yong notes the irony of this. While many think of our immune system as a defense that destroys microbes, ""microbes craft and tune our immune system in the first place!""(64). When research showed that microbes affect the brain and behavior, scientists experimented on sterilized mice and ""by swapping the bacteria in the animal's guts … also swapped part of their personalities""(72). Microbes even release a chemical called dopamine, which inhibits satisfaction. By releasing dopamine when you eat certain foods, microbes can potentially hone your diet to benefit them. Sadly, our little friends can turn on us sometimes. Many viruses actually control the microbes in your body which have gone rogue. These are called microphages: ""When they touch down on a bacterium, they inject their DNA and turn the microbes into a factory for making more phages""(89). Our immune system helps us control our microbes: ""It's more about balance and good management than defence and destruction""(91).  Yong describes our immune system as an ""immunostat."" When relaxed, it can encourage invasions from outside microbes. When intensified, the immune system attacks harmless microbes and cause inflammation. With our modern sanitation, Yong claims that we have tuned our ""immunostats"" to be set toward the latter. This inadvertently induces problems such as allergies. The lack of fiber in modern diets also affect our intense ""immunostat."" When microbes break down bacteria, a chemical called short fatty acid (SCFA) is produced. These galvanize an increase in our anti-inflammatory cells. Fibers also encourage the colonization of helpful microbes with certain digestive enzymes. Our modern world has ""cut off routes by which microbes reach us, and then starve those that make it""(125). We then use the microbes' own weaponry, antibiotics, to kill both harmful and helpful microbes. Without a healthy microbiome, many pathogens can easily penetrate our body. But Yong does not suggest that antibiotics never be utilized; instead, he warns of their overuse which ""disrupts our microbiome and foments the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria""(128).  Microbes also utilize the special power of horizontal gene transfers (HGTs). All microbes are able to transmit genes to one another. There is a scary aspect to this. Microbes with mutations that allow them to be resistant to antibiotics can transfer its genes to other microbes, making them antibiotic-resistant. Yong describes this as ""one of the greatest public health threats of the twenty-first century""(192). But, as with all things, we can harness HGT for our benefit. Yong illustrates this through nori. Nori, which contains special carbohydrates, cannot be digested by regular enzymes. But marine Zobellia can digest it! When nori was eaten raw, Zobellia found on the nori was also eaten. As the Zobellia passed through the gut, it transferred its genes to other microbes. This is why many Japanese are able to digest nori. So hypothetically, if we need some benefit a microbe has, we just need it to pass through our body and allow it to carry out HGT.  Yong imagines an à la carte future , where scientists can equip microbes with specific genes. Scientists could program the microbes to eliminate certain harmful substances. This is the wonderful future of synthetic biology: Synthetic biologist aren't limited to sending microbes after pathogens. They might also train their creations to eliminate cancer cells or convert toxins into medicines. (239) In this book, Yong takes readers on a fascinating ride through the history and application of microbiology. It contains compelling anecdotes which are sprinkled with a topping of information. For readers interested in how microbes affect our lives, Ed Yong's I Contain Multitudes is the book to devour."
666,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23212031-james-foster,5,"There is a scientific revolution happening right now that is changing how we think about living things, including ourselves. The new realization is that the world is dominated by organisms too small to see. Put another way, large organisms like us are passengers, not drivers, despite our egotistical assumptions to the contrary. The subtitle of Yong’s new book, “the Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life,” exactly captures the thrill of these microbiome studies. A microbiome comprises the microscopic organisms associated with an organism or ecosystem. We are learning that the living things we can see are dominated by, and cannot exist without, their microbiomes We are also learning that microbiomes are far more complicated and ubiquitous than we ever imagined. Here are some examples. All oxygen on earth comes from bacteria—most of it directly from oceanic algae, but some from molecular devices in plants that have descended from bacteria that invaded the plant ancestors long ago. Bacteria exist everywhere we have looked—miles down in solid rock, in boiling water, deep in the black ocean, in NASA “clean rooms,” in “sterile” hospitals, in insects, plants, soil, air, and of course in and on your skin, teeth, guts, genitals, nasal cavities, etc. In fact, everywhere we have actually looked has bacteria, including healthy breast milk, amniotic fluid (probably), blood, semen, lungs, and more. Moreover, these microbiomes can have hundreds (as in human dentitia, milk, and vaginas) to thousands (as in mammalian guts) of different kinds of bacteria. You cannot survive in the real world without your bacteria. To give just one example, your bacteria produce essential amino acids that your body cannot synthesize or extract from what you eat. Other examples of our reliance on bacteria: they fix nitrogen for plants, digest grass for cattle and wood for termites, produce antibiotics, determine the sex of some insects, and more. Even cooler, in my opinion, is that we don’t know what most of these bacteria are, how they live, or what they do. We only know they are there. This means that every time we look, we are very likely to discover (many) new “species” of bacteria. It is as if every time we examine a tablespoon of dirt, a wall swab, or a breath of air, we make a major new discovery, far surpassing Darwin’s experiences on the Beagle.Yet we can only grow about 3% (estimated) of the bacteria we find. So, how do we know they are there? We take all the DNA in a sample (a skin swab, a bit of poop, some dirt, whatever), chop it up, sequence it, and put the sequences back together. This is new. Only in the last 15 years or so have we been able to sequence unknown DNA on very large scales. It used to be necessary to already know what part of a DNA molecule looked like, in order to design so-called “primers” to jump start the sequencing process. Moreover, we used to need to grow bacteria before we could get enough DNA to sequence. In both cases, this presumed we already knew quite a bit about what bacteria were present, so that discovery was very limited. Also, until recently, computers were not powerful enough to handle huge volumes of data, or to figure out which DNA fragments belonged together. Not so long ago, the accepted wisdom was that bacteria (and viruses, and microscopic fungi) were mostly bad, either giving us diseases, damaging our crops, or infecting our livestock. The assumption was that “bacteria” and “pathogen” were nearly synonymous. After all, we call our current theory of disease “the germ theory”. I remember once giving a talk about microbiomes at a public event in the Moscow Alehouse while people were enjoying their beer and burgers. Afterwards, a clearly upset patron approached me, complaining that he didn’t want to hear about nasty bacteria, especially in his gut, while he was eating. I was astonished. Didn’t he realize that the ex-cow he was eating wouldn’t exist without bacteria or that he couldn’t digest it without his own gut bacteria, let alone that the alcohol in his beer was essentially yeast excrement? We need to stop thinking about the microscopic world as the enemy, and instead think of ourselves (and our crops, livestock, homes, etc.) as partners with them. Hence Yong’s subtitle, “a Grander View of Life.”That bacteria dominate the world really shouldn’t be a surprise. They far out number us. A patch of your intestine the size of your thumbnail has more bacteria than all humans that have ever existed. It shouldn’t be a surprise that they can do so many things or that they live in so many places. They were the only living things on Earth for two billion year, almost half of Earth’s existence. We shouldn’t be surprised that the human body has 100 times more bacterial than human genes. Humans have only for about one five hundredth of one percent of the time that bacteria have. I think it is unfortunate that Yong didn’t go with the shorter and, I think, more accurate and interesting title that he mentions in passing, namely “I Am Multitudes.” This is a bacterial planet.Full disclosure: when I have on my scientist hat, this is what I do for a living. I study cool microbiomes, such as the skin microbiome of a highly toxic newt, the microbiome in breast milk, the microbiome of mud from the bottom of the ocean, the human vaginal microbiome, and the microbiome in the gut of premature infants with cystic fibrosis. As a computer scientist, most of what I do is develop new algorithms interpret DNA data, but I also sometimes work directly with the biology. I chose to do microbiome science because it is so very cool to be part of a scientific revolution, and because the people, such as those profiled in this book, are fascinating.I have intentionally not given any details about which microbiomes Yong discusses, nor what they do in their environments. I don’t want to spoil the discoveries for you. Suffice it to say that I Contain Multitudes captures the excitement and scope of this field. Read it. You will be infected, intellectually!"
667,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"Famously, according to Douglas Adams, The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (not the novel, the 'actual' guide) begin by telling you at length how big space is, but then 'After a while the style settles down a bit and it starts telling you things you actually need to know' - and the opening of Ed Yong's exploration of the microbiome, the complex world of bacterial life inside us and generally in living things and around the world, is rather reminiscent of this. In the first couple of chapters, we are fed fact after fact in a staccato collection of information that has no sense of narrative or flow, rather like a set of frenzied bullet points, which becomes wearing for the reader. For example there are two paragraphs in a row, one with practically all the sentences starting 'They', and the next with almost all beginning 'We'll'. Thankfully, though, like the HHGTTG, We Are Multitude then settles down and gets on with job in hand.It's a job that Ed Yong does very well. It's hardly news that we have many, many bacterial cells in us (though it does biologists no scientific favours when we discover the much used 'ten times as many as human cells' figure was just picked out of the air and has no scientific basis). However, Yong quickly takes us beyond that to explore the nuances of a very intricate relationship between bacteria and more complex life that could be summarised as 'Can't live with them, can't live without them.' Even many of our most hated bacterial foes can have positive roles at the right place and the right time.What certainly comes across is that our knee-jerk reaction of 'germs are bad' leads to an overemphasis on removing them, where actually they are often doing a useful job. When we go mad with our antibacterial cleansers, we are more like to wipe out good bacteria, leaving space for colonisation by nasties, than we are to simply kill off a threat. And Yong gives us a dramatic tour of the sheer variety of microbes and the environments in which different bacterial life can thrive, whether we talking black smokers or dolphin armpits.Every now and then, we get some excellent storytelling, but the use of example after example does give the impression to the non-biologist of the kind of approach that led Rutherford to comment that all science is either physics or stamp collecting - there is a fair amount of stamp collecting here. However, whenever the reader is beginning to feel that they are losing interest, up comes a really interesting part. I loved, for example, the story of the way that bacteria actually re-engineer the physical structure of a glow-in-the-dark squid. And it's hard not be impressed by the description of bacteria surveys being undertaken in a brand new hospital as it is brought into use, to see where the bugs come from. One of the particularly engaging observations is the emphasis on the benefits of open windows to allow bacteria to come in from the outside. Your mum's enthusiasm for getting you out in the fresh air was justified after all.If there's one message the reader comes away with, it's that we need to be more nuanced in our thinking about bacteria - sometimes, it seems almost to be a case of 'sit back and enjoy the ride, because whatever you do will probably mess things up.' You'll never look at a probiotic yogurt drink or a bottle of toilet cleaner the same again."
668,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,5,"A fantastic book covering an area that is the hot topic of the day in biology: the microbiome and how it affects us all. However, as the author shows, there is currently a lot of hype surrounding some aspects of the microbiome, like in probiotics and fecal transplants. This book will help readers to navigate the minefield of papers and articles about the microbiome and show you just what we know and, more importantly, what we still don't know about it and how it can affect our lives and the environment.Ed Yong starts with a look at how people like Leeuwenhoek discovered the world of bacteria and then goes on to show how microbes can interact with multi-celled organisms, like us, to form and grow them; for the fact is the genes and cells of animals (and probably plants) need the microbes to help mediate the growth of bodies. Experiments with sterile (germ-free) animals show they don't grow or develop well without the microbes.However, the microbes are not the selfless helpers of animals. Like any other organism, they also act in their self-interest and will grow and multiply uncontrollably inside animals (causing diseases) unless they are controlled by the body. This back-and-forth of conflict and cooperation is shown to occur not just in bodies but also in our environment. Numerous examples, from coral reefs that grow or die depending on which types of microbes are around, to malnutrition in children, are evidence of the action of different kinds of microbiomes.Now that we are starting to learn about microbiomes, what can we do about it. Here, the author covers the various experiments and studies that have been conducted or are being conducted to try to understand how various microbiomes work. He is also careful not to over-state the results of the studies for, in reality, we still know very little about the interactions of the microbes in the microbiomes and the changes we introduce may be for the better or worse.This book covers the very latest research into the microbiome; a look at the very long list of endnotes show some research where the results have yet to be published at the book's release. A definite must-read for those who want a glimpse of how microbes, despite their very small size, can affect our environment in surprising ways."
669,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,5,"Ed Yong may just be the best science writer currently working. In either case, this regular contributor to The Atlantic has written a brilliant book about the teeming microbial communities that live inside us, governing our health, illness, allergies and relationships with others.People who know about this topic generally have heard about it in terms of the somewhat offputting idea of fecal transplants, in which people with persistent C. difficile gut infections have been cured by giving them a sample of someone else's stool. It is a mark of how broad and incisive this book is that Yong doesn't get to the fecal transplant topic until the penultimate chapter.The rest of the book ranges far and wide through nature, from the scientist studying the microbiomes of zoo animals to the ones studying light emitting squids to those that are cataloging how microbial communities grow inside buildings ranging from hospitals to hotel rooms.Yong explains with literate craft how we have been hampered by a simplistic two-sided view of this hugely diverse microbial world. We either think of microbes as disease causing baddies that need to be vanquished, or as benign ""probiotic"" species that will turn us into healthy Birkenstock-wearing granola-crunching citizens. In fact, these microbial communities live in a tenuous and shifting balance with their hosts, whether they are mosquitoes, beewolf wasps or human beings, and if we aren't careful, tampering with these communities can cause more harm than good.Nevertheless, there are many exciting possibilities being explored by researchers for making our lives better, from breeding mosquitoes than are incapable of carrying the dengue or Zika viruses, to 3D-printed balls that will seed our hospital rooms with healthy microbes to specially designed microbial pills that can be dispensed to deal with an individual's particular ailment.We truly do contain multitudes, and this is one of the best, most gracefully written and cutting edge science books I've encountered."
670,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s,4,"All of us have an abundant microscopic menagerie, collectively known as the microbiota or microbiome. They live on our surface, inside our bodies, and sometimes inside our very cells. the vast majority of them are bacteria, but there are also other tiny organisms including fungi (such as yeasts) and archaea... There are viruses too, in unfathomable numbers...I've read some books recently about the microbiome. The Hidden Half of Nature: The Microbial Roots of Life and Health touched on it, but not satisfyingly enough. Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics Is Fueling Our Modern Plagues was really great, although almost a bit too evangelistic in his fervor for our resident bacteria and his ideas of how our mistreatment of it might be driving modern diseases. Ed Yong does a great job of toning that down a little and explaining how scientists believe our bodies became so dependent upon them for our health.Unfortunately, much of the book doesn't really talk about the human microbiome at all. He talks about pangolins and squid and aphids and termites and mealy bugs and... you get the (sometimes tedious) point. For me the strongest parts were where he discussed how our microbiome helps us to digest foods or how it protects us from sickness. Some points I got from the book were that human health is best with 1) natural childbirth, 2) breast-feeding, and 3) having pets in the home, especially dogs. And I absolutely loved his sense of humor - a little on the dry side, but right up my alley. So, while I was hoping for more emphasis on human health, it was still a very interesting book."
671,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5039223-ben-gutierrez,3,"For most of human history, microbes were invisible to us, though we sometimes saw their effects. After they were discovered, we paid most attention to the bacteria that caused disease or the bacteria that could fight disease.In recent decades, our attitude has shifted from fighting bacteria at every step, to understanding its vital role in the health of all living species. With the new view of bacteria, and our greater ability to understand it, we've begun to use it in ever subtler ways to improve the health of ourselves and other species.If you want a shorter read, try reading the first few chapters, which outline the history of our understanding of bacteria and will give you an idea of how amazing it is. Then, read the last two chapters: Microbes à la Carte and Tomorrow the World.The last two might be the most important, because almost all popular journalism about bacteria comes with all these promises of how bacteria will cure weight gain, how a new superbug is going to wipe out the entire human species, or how eating yogurt, kombucha, and sauerkraut is going to give you the bowel movements you've always dreamed of. At least, that's always my interpretation of these articles. The last portion of the book sheds more light on these ideas, and thereby tempers them. It's not that bacteria isn't dynamic cellular life in its rawest form that can do pretty much anything. It is and it can. But life is very complex and often does not have simple solutions."

I am glad it was my first book delving into the microbes and how they interact with life because it doesn't just focus on humans and our digestive tract. It does touch on it, but it covers so much more. How microbes interact in nature and with other animals, how our hospitals may actually be too clean and causing us harm, how probiotics you can buy may not be what you think they are (they are overly hyped), how microbes work in teams at times, how too much of a good thing is actually a bad thing. This book is great for an overview of the interactions of microbes with nature in general. It goes into a bit more detail on some of the subjects I mentioned above. I look forward to finding out more about the interactions in humans. "

The book takes us on a tour of the rapidly growing field of microbiology, demonstrating their crucial importance to species (including humans) and entire ecologies. Useful when thinking about the world and practically useful in living your life, not many science book can pull both off. Several themes I have came across before in the press or science blogs, even these capture the interest due to the quality of the writing. Bringing to life even the gross parts about fecal transplants (featuring an unfortunate blender!).Only minor quibble would be that even at a few years old large stride have already taken place that will of course not be present, that is most clear in the final chapter which feels a little threadbare compared to all of the others."

This book did not disappoint. I have been reading more and more in short news articles about the microbiome - the trillions of microbes that live within us. But this book gave the author the chance to explore the microbes of the world - from the deepest ocean, insects and animals, plant life and humans of course - and see how the multitudes of microbes at various times protect, destroy, change, adapt and interact with various hosts. It was fascinating to read about and I will look forward to finding out about new discoveries in this field."

They were here long before we were and will most certainly outlive us. That's actually not what he's saying at all, but sort of the message I took away from it. This is a super accessible science book. I thought some of it was too niche or not interesting, but none of it was too difficult to understand. I also like his carefulness in examining the crazy claims of the ""probiotics"" evangelists.

In fact, there were several moments that this felt like a punishment. Many of the chapters felt convoluted and meandering. I gained some fun parcels of knowledge. I can better appreciate how the microbiotic world impacts all of evolution. Amazing. Thinking about medicine as gardening instead of warfare? Meaningful.

As an individual, you are not measured just by your mettle but by the mettle of your microbiome⁠—all the microbes collectively on and in your person. I Contain Multitudes boldly brings to your attention just how teeming the world and we are with invisible life.As some of the earliest forms of life on Earth, bacteria have developed diverse mechanisms and processes to survive on land, sea, and the most extreme environments. In the words of Yong, bacteria are ""metabolic wizards,"" now my new favorite way of describing how they can break down most anything: crude oil, plastics, plant material, you name it. In essence, if there's a way, you can bet there's a bacteria that has found it. Ed Yong's goal here is to dispel the overwhelming notion that bacteria are an evil to be eradicated, the infamous pathogens responsible for tuberculosis, cholera, tetanus, and the plague. Those bacteria are only a tiny drop in the bucket; there's a planet full of fascinating microbes that are harmless or, taking it a step further, essential for animal survival.The numerous examples which Yong provides of important symbiotic, or mutually beneficial, relationships between animal and bacteria demonstrate that such mutual coevolution simply cannot be ignored. Insects, squids, and yes, humans would find their immune defense and nutritional health wanting should the little microbes disappear. Mention about the scary Clostridium difficile, a bacteria that ravages the human gut when antibiotics clean out the healthy microbes within, hits close to home about the importance of recognizing the microbiome as a community, a vibrant ecosystem. There has only been a recent paradigm shift in recognizing both scientifically and medically that bacteria aren't solely organisms which ought to be nuked out of existence. On the flip side, that can lead to some overzealous claims about their benevolence (sorry, natural selection is still cranking away), but Yong is careful to point out when the data behind wild claims about bacterial miracles is just a little too shaky to trust. There's a lack of quantification for much of what Yong says, but I blame the state of the research field more than his skills as a science writer for a popular audience. He qualifies and admits the inherent weaknesses that a number of studies about the microbiome have; frankly, there is plenty of bad science out there. Instead, Yong chooses to look optimistically, to pique our attention towards the great potential for research results that are yet to be released. Though the information can become a little dense at times, Yong delivers a wide berth of information with easily digestible and dynamic language. At times, he writes with almost a childlike wonder at the biology, passionate about new discoveries and the future directions of research. Microbes are an undeniable part of each of us, and though Yong doesn't go full force towards heavy hitting questions about who we are, there is plenty of relevance to our lives and our worldview stocked in this book. Ultimately, I Contain Multitudes leaves us readers with our hopes raised for some incredible scientific advancements to be made with the proper lens—a lens zoomed into the microbes, that is."

Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes."" - Walt WhitmanI'm a priori inclined to like bacteria. My favorite is Oenococcus Oeni, even though that's not the only bacteria that causes the poorly-named malolactic fermentation during winemaking (malolactic conversion is better jargon, but I digress). No one really extols the virtues of super young red wine (I mean, besides those marketing masters in Beaujolais, but I'm firmly of the opinion that, if the terroir's worth tastin', skip the carbonic maceration). Straight out of the fermentation tank, red wine tastes like tart apples, which is not generally what you want. Introduce a little Oenococcus Oeni, and the apple taste softens up into butter. And I don't trust people who don't like butter.Northern California is apparently swarming with hippies, such as myself, who imagine that we're all interconnected cosmic beings embracing within a universal stew (or maybe cheese plate, we do a lot of wine and cheese up here, and I've been driving through redwoods for a few hours so it's a little hard for me to come up with a fitting metaphor). I Contain Multitudes is not only poetically written, but it deepens the feeling that we're all in this together. It's kind of like that episode of The Magic School Bus where the gang shrinks to the size of a blood cell and floats around the human body, but for educated grown ups who also listen to NPR. I recommend I Contain Multitudes, especially for people who want a more nuanced explanation of the hygiene hypothesis, fecal transplants, probiotics, and other bacteria-related stuff being reported in the news these days. Also recommended for stoners who want to think about the fact that we live in cities, but we also contain cities of bacteria, and the bacteria are floating in our bodies, and we're all fucking floating in space."

The focus of the book is microbiomes – the microbial ecosystems that exist on and in nearly every object on our planet (including us). Yong initially explores how scientific perceptions of the microbial world have changed from the first studies by Leeuwenhoek to the golden age of antibiotics to our microbiome-paper-a-day modern era and then jumps into ongoing microbiome research. The book is rich in excerpts from interviews with many leading scientists and covers a range of topics from the human microbiome to ecological consequences of altering microbial communities. As with Yong’s writing elsewhere, it is exciting and engaging while remaining rigorously factual and avoiding sensationalism. My one criticism is that the book lacked a strong over-arching narrative – it felt like I was jumping from one fascinating story to the next without a clear sense of direction. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in gaining a more nuanced understanding of the microbial world."

Ed Yong has captured a superb snapshot of a rapidly developing field. Microbes are not good or bad, as we used to be taught. They just are. Every animal, including us of course, is a dynamic ecosystem balancing countless species of bacteria plus viruses and other icky things. Microbes have evolved along with each other and animals in a balance that usually works best for everyone, because they were naturally selected to do so.Ed Yong writes so beautifully and naturally that you can gallop through this book with joy. His sly witticisms, stories, and elegant prose make a very complex subject understandable and consistently fascinating.

I can't pretend that I understood or will remember the majority of what he said but, it wasn't really that kind of book. This is a book that is meant to inspire the reader with a greater sense of wonder at the beauty and complexity of both our own bodies and of the world around us.I may just have to take a microbiology class at my local Jr College to gain a better understanding of the material this book covered."

I Contain Multitudes
. This book changed all of that. Starting with a short introduction to our history with the microorganisms we share our world with, to evaluating how our relationship with them have evolved over the decades, and filled with wonderfully curious and startling facts and discoveries not just about the microbes themselves, but of their roles in our health, development and future; several chapters into this book, I felt like I was seeing and thinking about microbes everywhere, in relation to everything. This book not only opened my eyes to the ubiquitous and brilliant nature of microbes, it gave me a newfound appreciation for the ones who cohabit my body – millions and millions of tiny little creatures that have turned me into a living, dynamic ecosystem. While having a basic understanding of microbiology did help make it easier to understand the information in this book, the language has been made accessible even to audiences without any scientific background. Ed Young has a true gift for writing – his strength lies in his ability to fashion clever, easily-comprehensible analogies in order to break down complex biological systems and theories. This book is also brimming with humour and passion. I particularly enjoyed the section at the end regarding synthetic biology and the potential for “microbial medicine” in our future.

700,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,4,"Microbes are a cultural novelty. We've only had a couple centuries to learn how to think about them, and all the metaphors we've developed in that time are based on some thin gropings in a world much older and more complex than we've realized until very recently. So part of Yong's goal is to introduce some of the research that brings us into that new world, and another part is to confront some of those metaphors and show how inadequate they are in light of that new evidence. There's not much of a thesis or a structure here; Yong is a great science writer and has covered a lot of research in articles, and this book feels like a series of those articles strung together around loosely related themes. A lot of that research is really amazing. I thought I was pretty hip to the microbiome stuff and had a sense of how important microbial ecology was. But there were still lots of revelations left for me here. The fundamental role of microbes in shaping animal development, for instance, or the enormous spectrum of what Wolbachia does in insect biology. There are two big ideas running through all of these stories. One is the extended phenotype: the idea that organisms inherit genes that code for their own bodies but also for compounds that shape the environment of other organisms. While Yong lets scientists waffle over the precise utility of the term ""hologenome"" for the genes of an organism and its symbionts (since the jobs must be done but often the organisms that do them can vary tremendously). But there are dozens of stories of particular organisms outsourcing development and maintenance work to their symbionts, and eventually even acquiring them as part of their own genome. The line between symbiont and host is blurred in a dozen different ways.The other idea, which is somewhat more profound if more obvious and intuitive in retrospect, is that microbial ecology isn't magic. It's subject to the same concepts we use to describe other ecological systems, if with some major differences in the particulars. I've had this vague notion that microbes are sort of everywhere, all the time, and that they can always find substrates as soon as they exist, that they can form dormant bodies that can tolerate extended periods without resources, etc. This seems to be an exaggeration; ultimately, microbial ecology functions just like plant ecology or insect ecology: the community present is determined by available propagules and environmental niches (available resources, competitors, temperature and pH, etc). This is where Yong's book left me wanting more. There are enough examples that this picture starts to become clear, but I'm wanting a more explicit statement of how these things work in the aggregate. Because the example systems he covers make it quite clear that microbial communities occupy, to a greater or lesser extent, pretty much every surface and volume we ever interact with. And we still seem to only have the faintest idea what any of that actually means--what they do, how they're determined, etc. Part of the problem here is that, again, while it may be feasible to take samples and use genetic analysis to characterize what's present, that doesn't really mean anything to us. It's easy for us to think in terms of animal metaphors, or landscapes, to grasp the impact of an invasive plant or the extinction of a major predator. We can visualize it, and all the players have some kind of innate personality. Even things that have names and a known role may simply do something completely different in another place. Maybe that work has been done (Wolbachia, for instance, seems to have a fairly wide knowledge base). But in the context of this book, there are some odd juxtapositions. Yong will talk about how important it is for us to have the right communities of gut microbiota, and how an organism isn't a pathogen or a mutualist except under the right circumstances. But then in other places he'll describe particular microbes as opportunistic and weedy species that thrive in over-cleaned environments and how this state is dysbiotic and unhealthy. I guess I'm just wanting to know more about particular pathogenic species now, which are presumably especially well-studied? "
701,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"Read this book if you are a doctor, nurse or public health official. Read this if you are an architect or botanist. Read this if you are very scared of germs and desire a sterile environment everywhere. This ground breaking book introduced to readers the world of microbiome, or world of microbes living inside other organisms. So there are bacteria everywhere on the surface and inside the gut of animals. They serve many critical functions: providing fluorescence for squids for camouflaging them from creatures below them. They live in termites’ stomach and digest wood fibres. They help kill pathogenic viruses and bacteria so protect the host. Breast milk provides food for benign gut bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis that protects us from diarrhoea. They secrete mucus lining our gut that enables virus (bacteriophages) that kills harmful bacteria! They co-evolve with their hosts. This symbiosis is not always benign, but is based on mutual advantage. Some animals hosts certain bacteria in the larval stage but discard them once they grow up to be adults. Even our own gut microbiome changes with time, sometimes within days. Animals growing up in a sterile environment behave strangely and are prone to funny diseases. Babies acquire their first microbiome in the mothers’ birth canal and thus normal birth is still better than caesarean section. Rampant antibiotic use destroys our diverse microbiome, allowing bad bugs to overgrow. Probiotics help but they cannot stay long in our gut. Animals routinely eat each other’s stools to acquire its microbiome. Some clostridium difficile bacteria are so resistant that no antibiotics can kill them. Fecal transplant (yes transfer of stools) have been used successfully to cure patients of clostridium infection and has been approved by FDA. Unfortunately the effects on other illnesses such as inflammatory bowel syndrome and autism has not been consistent so far. Furthermore, some do-it-yourself cases have ended in severe infection of the recipient. Another use of our new knowledge is in medicine. Filariasis is a sickness that causes very swollen feet and legs because of roundworm infection. When they are killed, Wolbachia bacteria inside is released, triggering inflammation and destruction of lymph nodes. So the legs get permanently swollen. Now doxycycline is used to kill the Wolbachia first, then the roundworms can be killed easily without problems. An exciting new use is the discovery that Wolbachia also renders the Aedes mosquitos less able to carry the horrible dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses. So Aedes mosquitos infected with Wolbachia have been released to the wild to displace the wild type mosquitos (because infected females preferentially mate with infected males) and dengue has been controlled. This was started in Australia called the World Mosquito Program, and is being carried out in countries such as Indonesia and Mexico. Counterintuitively, toilets that are more often scrubbed have more easily colonised by E. coli (stool bacteria that transmit gastroenteritis). A diverse microbiome allows other less vicious germs to proliferate and compete with E. coli. Hospitals are too clean thus allowing antibiotic resistant bugs to proliferate, causing nosocomial infections. Florence Nightingale had it right: opening hospital windows decrease those infections by allowing entry of a more diverse microbiome through those windows!A solid 5 star book!"

This was the perfect one!As a side note, the last year or so I've been crafting a ""microbiome diet"" for myself (originally, I thought of it more as an ""anti-inflammatory diet,"" with a high focus on anti-oxidants and various phytonutrients; meaning, lots of spices, and colorful fruits and vegetables). The main focus is to eat more plants, more variety of fiber (insoluble, soluble, resistant starch, inulin/prebiotics, etc), as well as common, traditional, probiotic foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, miso, kimchi, ""raw"" pickles, kombucha, etc). and even - counter-intuitively - some anti-bacterial foods (honey, hot peppers, grape seed extract, cinnamon, etc). I had heard of so many good correlations with having a healthy gut microbiome (reduced rates of cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, etc - as well as improved mood, mental health and possibly even IQ!), that I wanted to do something to support mine. But, the science is still pretty new, so I didn't want to do anything drastic. Eating ""healthier"" seemed like the most effective, least drastic thing I could do. Then I dropped 10 lbs and a pants size, which was totally unintentional, but I won't complain. Now I tell people that I accidentally discovered the secret to weight loss: Get your daily recommended serving of fiber! (For women, this is 25g, for men 30-37g).My recommended list of high fiber foods includes:Overnight Oats (Cocoa-PB, often with a banana)Chia Pudding (often with berries)Cocoa-Banana-Peanut Butter smoothieRoasted Chickpeas (simple seasoning: garlic/salt/cayenne)Pumpkin Seeds (in-shell)Okra Chips (Sprouts carries them)Edamame PastaGuacamoleWhole Grain BreadDark ChocolateFig Cake (Whole Foods sometimes carries this)Dark Chocolate Covered Figs (Safeway has them)Peetos (pea-based cheetos)Harvest Snaps (lentil-based puffs, Tomato Basil flavor)Avocado Sandwich (Avocado, sauerkraut, mustard, hot banana pepper rings, and smoked gouda toasted on whole grain bread)Apple Slices with Peanut ButterArtichokes (Google ""Magic Artichoke Dip"")AsparagusMushroomsLentils (TasyBite brand is good, and convenient)Meatless Crumbles (I like the Quorn brand, derived from mycelium)Nut Bars (Costco's Kirkland brand has 7g of fiber per bar, and is tasty)"

Working at a public library I handle dozens of book everyday, all of which were handled by a wide variety of peoples, and what this experience does is that it forces me to encounter ideas, perspectives, and reading habits I never would have experienced on my own. It also allows me to encounter a wide variety of microscopic organisms.Ed Yong's book is one of those beautiful love letters to science in which a writer is able to communicate their passion for the field of science. Not only this, Song is able to infect me with his passion by teaching me about the kinds of microbes that infect me on a regular basis. I Contain Multitudes is infectious though, because the passion is on every page, and by the end of this book I was spellbound by how multifaceted the study of microbiomes and microbes actually was. Like many people I thought of microbes as just germs, little organisms that existed solely to make me sick. In this book Yong got me to reconsider this position. Not only that, but Long got me to reconsider my own biology and realize that the little bugs were not just alien organisms living inside of me or on me, they were, in essence, part of me. Yong observes how an individual's microbes evolve in relation to their host, adapting or in some cases being adapted by said host. After a time it becomes clear to the reader that their microbes are not just alien organisms, but part of a long evolutionary lineage that has allowed them to become the incredible species they are today, and even when Yong is writing about the symbiosis between microbes and aphids, mosquitos, and dogs the reader constantly bombarded by his passion and his ability to see the significance of these relationships.There's so many great reasons to read this book, I'm just going to settle on the fact that the man made fecal transplants something both fascinating to read about, and also something I actually wanted to learn more about."
704,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33440429-ashish,4,"This book takes a look at the world that is lurking behind everything that we see, touch, smell and feel. It's in the food we eat, the ground we walk on, the house we live in and inside our body, in the millions. The microbes that comprise this world are capable of causing diseases but also give us medicines, they cause decay but also keep the natural cycle in place and so much more. The book is the author's love letter to this microbial world, and much like what Siddharth Mukherjee did for Cancer in ""Emperor of all Maladies"", he charters the historical and ever evolving (literally) place that they occupy in our world.The book deals with everything that we need to know about the microbial world. From how they came into existence, to the role that have played in terra forming earth as we know it, to their importance in modern medicine, the author doesn't leave any stone unturned to showcase their importance. The book is very well researched and references numerous studies to back up it's claims. Yong is clearly super passionate about this stuff and in this he might seem to oversell the product, but he exercises restraint, bringing in a dose of a reality check as he remains quite optimistic about some of the tremendously far reaching applications that microbes can have on us and the society. It draws from a number of fields as the reach of the microbial world is quite far, from the depth of the ocean a mile or more below the surface, to the coldest and hottest regions knows to man, to the human gut, to the insides of a termite, we get a broad outlook on the amount of research that has goes into and still does into them.A really good book, which could have been edited a little better to keep the pace up, but still managed to keep you hooked. It's a must read for nature lovers, for those interested in science and who want to stay informed about the possibilities that the future holds for mankind."
705,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4017921-mckenzie,4,"This is my kind of science book: an approachable introduction to a previously confusing specialty, taking its title from Walt Whitman of all places. Ed Yong sees the poetry in microbiology, and shares that vision with his readers while explaining the history of our understanding of bacteria, the surprising ways bacteria interact with their environments and hosts, and the medical possibilities as we come to understand our own microbiomes. While my interest in Yong's topic lagged during the sections focusing mostly on insects, the sections about the environment and human interactions were most fascinating for me. I learned, among other things, that human babies do not have the microbes they need to be healthy until they pass through the birth canal and are breastfed; that certain bacteria have been shown to counteract or prevent inflammation of the sort associated with multiple sclerosis, at least in mice; that fecal transplants are a real thing that doctors prescribe to reset the gut bacteria of people with certain diseases; and most excitingly, that we could be heading towards a future where doctors prescribe us bacteria concoctions to alleviate medical problems, the way they today prescribe antibiotics. If any of this interests you, you should read I Contain Multitudes. It's not quite on the same level of awe as Emperor of All Maladies, but considering that I've been walking around happily envisioning the trillions of bacteria I interact with every day at work, at home, with my cat, and with my friends, I'd say this is a book that can certainly teach anyone something, and change the way you view our natural world.

Maybe a few too many corny jokes, but even those are endearing. Biggest problem was the tremendous amount of vivisection described very cavalierly; this book is largely about the results of animal research and isn't remotely concerned with the ethics of that.Even the narrative mindset is way too human-centric for me. Example that made me boggle the most: frog-killing fungus epidemic is described as terrible for ""frog lovers"" rather than for terrible for frogs. Oh, many of the endnotes are well worth reading! Lots of little enlightening and entertaining tidbits mixed in with the drier stuff. "

I liked the book, but frankly it wasn't until the last three chapters that I found a narrative. Perhaps that is because I am less interested in a collection of facts about what we do and do not (more the latter than the former) about microbes, and more interested in how this translates into practical application. I wouldn't recommend listening to this one in audiobook. You will feel more like someone is reading you a list than someone is telling you about story, and thus I think it loses some of its wonder."
710,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3528864-darryl,4,"This fascinating and informative book by the acclaimed British science writer Ed Yong explores the symbiotic relationships between microorganisms and more advanced life forms, including humans, and how these beneficial and sometimes harmful interactions affect our bodies' health and ability to function effectively, and the features that allow pathogenic species to colonize and infect us.

719,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Individuality is a cherished trait of sagacious beings. Man is the only such animal which is conscious of its self. Man stands alone in his mental transactions with the outside world. This aloofness is way off the true state of things. Very small microbes and other inanimate objects thrive in our body and are present in very large numbers on all our body parts. The presence of microbes is thought to be a bad thing in routine awareness sermons, but this is not necessarily so. Microbes are beneficial or neutral to us on most of the occasions and provide immense service to us. They keep our guts healthy, calibrate our immune systems, make us less sensitive to allergens and can even exert influence on our brains. This horde of microbes in our body makes each individual human being a multitude which acts in tandem to work as a symbiotic whole. Ed Yong is an award-winning science writer who regularly contributes to leading journals and scientific publications.The author makes a brilliant comparison scheme to present the contrast between life forms almost perennially lived on earth against others who are relatively latecomers to the party of life. He equates our planet’s entire life to a human year in which the present is just before midnight on December 31. On such a scale, the entry of humans was just half an hour ago, at 11.30 pm, while microbes ruled the globe between the months of March to October, that is, between their entry and the advent of higher organisms. This ingenuous example clarifies all doubts on the antiquity of microbes as compared to mammals or other higher forms of life.Microbes are everywhere, but due to the very small size of them, they remained invisible to mankind till the seventeenth century. It was then Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a pioneering lens-maker in Holland, witnessed these organisms everywhere – in water, in hand tools, in his body, home and everywhere! For a time, others couldn’t make lenses with the resolving power as Leeuwenhoek’s, but when at last they did, the scholars were shocked to find themselves colonized by these microbes. It took nearly another century to distinguish the good from the bad. Many microbes live in symbiosis with their hosts. It can also be said that microbes help us become what we are by modifying the genes of parent organisms in subtle ways. Biologists have experimentally demonstrated that organisms that live in sterile Lab-like environments where the microbes are strictly controlled suffer growth problems in the absence of friendly bacteria. Yong includes examples where the microbes affect the growth of brain. Specific strains of bacteria can be encouraged with the help of probiotics (the reverse process as antibiotics). Lack of exposure to symbiotic microbes had resulted in depression and anxiety in the hosts.The book argues that the sharp distinction between good and bad microbes is an oversimplification. Even the good ones create life-threatening situations when their position is changed, say from the gut to the blood stream. Mitochondria are present in every mammal cell, which generates the energy the cell so dearly needs. Scientists presume that mitochondria were independent microbes in the beginning of life and later settled inside the animal cell in a case of mutually beneficial symbiosis. Even with a history of living together for billions of years, if the mitochondrion is to enter the blood stream somehow, the immune system of the host attacks it with vigour as if it was a foreign particle and not a part of its own body. Yong presents the case of Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium in our gut that causes ulcer and stomach cancer. A very bad guy, obviously. But what will happen if we kill all of them in our guts? Scientists warn that we are in for more trouble, as these bacteria also protects against oesophageal cancer! As in life, it is a fine line that separates the good from the ugly in the case of microbes as well.The clever ways in which mothers help their babies grow microbes in their guts is interesting to read. The author has used many scientific terms to describe the process, but one such case is very noteworthy. Human breast milk contains a family of chemicals called Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO) which can’t be digested by the infant! Why on earth are such chemicals present in mother’s milk? The shocking answer is that these are good for a specific species of bacteria in the child’s long intestine. HMO nourishes these microbes, which in turn produces short-chain fatty acids. These feed the infant’s gut cells by making adhesive proteins that seal the gap between gut cells and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system. Needless to say, babies nurtured with bottled milk don’t develop this familiarity of the immune system to microbes. This results in inflammations where the immune system overreacts even to benign external particles. The book also speculates that microbes control obesity. Obese people have more Firmicutes and fewer Bacteroidetes than their leaner counterparts in their stomach. Transferring these microbes among lab mice showed that those mice which received microbes that characterized obesity put in more weight and vice versa. There is, however, no assurance that this result can be repeated in humans.Do you remember the scary day when New Scientist magazine trumpeted on its cover that Darwin was wrong? It talked about a system of gene transfer which is horizontal, that is, from one individual to another without any reproductive act called Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). This differed with the vertical scheme Darwin had in mind, that is, from parent to offspring. The devil was in the details, and if you had read the whole article, it emphasized Darwin’s theorem rather than upsetting it. But for those who judge a book by its cover, it presented an avoidable opportunity to score on the supposed ‘error’ in Darwinism. HGT is widely seen in the world of microbes. Yong presents the curious case of the ‘nori’ seaweed that is a delicacy in Japan. Humans normally can’t digest the seaweed as the gut bacteria are unable to process them. But those who ate them first ingested marine bacteria skilled in the job. It exchanged genes with normal gut bacteria and entered its genome. Then it proceeded to colonize people via the normal biome transfer between parent and child.In the latter chapters of the book, the author describes about several revolutionary techniques of healing with bacteria, which are generally interesting but revolting at times. The faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) techniques may provide a fast cure for stomach-related issues, but it shows that a microbiologist’s career is not always glamorous! Manipulating the microbiome of an entire region or a person is discussed at length, but Yong tactfully stops short of anticipating repercussions that may arise when one plays with an entire biome. If the author is to be believed – and there are many solid reasons to do so – microbes are definitely going to play a significant part in formulating the therapies of the future. The book is neatly written and displays the confidence of the author in the beneficence of what he describes to mankind. A number of colour plates add to the visual appeal. A good number of Notes and a comprehensive index enhance the utility of the book.The book is highly recommended."

I Contain Multitudes
. This book changed all of that. Starting with a short introduction to our history with the microorganisms we share our world with, to evaluating how our relationship with them have evolved over the decades, and filled with wonderfully curious and startling facts and discoveries not just about the microbes themselves, but of their roles in our health, development and future; several chapters into this book, I felt like I was seeing and thinking about microbes everywhere, in relation to everything. This book not only opened my eyes to the ubiquitous and brilliant nature of microbes, it gave me a newfound appreciation for the ones who cohabit my body – millions and millions of tiny little creatures that have turned me into a living, dynamic ecosystem. While having a basic understanding of microbiology did help make it easier to understand the information in this book, the language has been made accessible even to audiences without any scientific background. Ed Young has a true gift for writing – his strength lies in his ability to fashion clever, easily-comprehensible analogies in order to break down complex biological systems and theories.

The fundamental role of microbes in shaping animal development, for instance, or the enormous spectrum of what Wolbachia does in insect biology. There are two big ideas running through all of these stories. One is the extended phenotype: the idea that organisms inherit genes that code for their own bodies but also for compounds that shape the environment of other organisms. While Yong lets scientists waffle over the precise utility of the term ""hologenome"" for the genes of an organism and its symbionts (since the jobs must be done but often the organisms that do them can vary tremendously). But there are dozens of stories of particular organisms outsourcing development and maintenance work to their symbionts, and eventually even acquiring them as part of their own genome. The line between symbiont and host is blurred in a dozen different ways.The other idea, which is somewhat more profound if more obvious and intuitive in retrospect, is that microbial ecology isn't magic. It's subject to the same concepts we use to describe other ecological systems, if with some major differences in the particulars. I've had this vague notion that microbes are sort of everywhere, all the time, and that they can always find substrates as soon as they exist, that they can form dormant bodies that can tolerate extended periods without resources, etc. This seems to be an exaggeration; ultimately, microbial ecology functions just like plant ecology or insect ecology: the community present is determined by available propagules and environmental niches (available resources, competitors, temperature and pH, etc). This is where Yong's book left me wanting more. There are enough examples that this picture starts to become clear, but I'm wanting a more explicit statement of how these things work in the aggregate. Because the example systems he covers make it quite clear that microbial communities occupy, to a greater or lesser extent, pretty much every surface and volume we ever interact with. And we still seem to only have the faintest idea what any of that actually means--what they do, how they're determined, etc. Part of the problem here is that, again, while it may be feasible to take samples and use genetic analysis to characterize what's present, that doesn't really mean anything to us. It's easy for us to think in terms of animal metaphors, or landscapes, to grasp the impact of an invasive plant or the extinction of a major predator. We can visualize it, and all the players have some kind of innate personality. Even things that have names and a known role may simply do something completely different in another place. Maybe that work has been done (Wolbachia, for instance, seems to have a fairly wide knowledge base). But in the context of this book, there are some odd juxtapositions. Yong will talk about how important it is for us to have the right communities of gut microbiota, and how an organism isn't a pathogen or a mutualist except under the right circumstances. But then in other places he'll describe particular microbes as opportunistic and weedy species that thrive in over-cleaned environments and how this state is dysbiotic and unhealthy. I guess I'm just wanting to know more about particular pathogenic species now, which are presumably especially well-studied? "

Read this if you are very scared of germs and desire a sterile environment everywhere. This ground breaking book introduced to readers the world of microbiome, or world of microbes living inside other organisms. So there are bacteria everywhere on the surface and inside the gut of animals. They serve many critical functions: providing fluorescence for squids for camouflaging them from creatures below them. They live in termites’ stomach and digest wood fibres. They help kill pathogenic viruses and bacteria so protect the host. Breast milk provides food for benign gut bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis that protects us from diarrhoea. They secrete mucus lining our gut that enables virus (bacteriophages) that kills harmful bacteria! They co-evolve with their hosts. This symbiosis is not always benign, but is based on mutual advantage. Some animals hosts certain bacteria in the larval stage but discard them once they grow up to be adults. Even our own gut microbiome changes with time, sometimes within days. Animals growing up in a sterile environment behave strangely and are prone to funny diseases. Babies acquire their first microbiome in the mothers’ birth canal and thus normal birth is still better than caesarean section. Rampant antibiotic use destroys our diverse microbiome, allowing bad bugs to overgrow. Probiotics help but they cannot stay long in our gut. Animals routinely eat each other’s stools to acquire its microbiome. Some clostridium difficile bacteria are so resistant that no antibiotics can kill them. Fecal transplant (yes transfer of stools) have been used successfully to cure patients of clostridium infection and has been approved by FDA. Unfortunately the effects on other illnesses such as inflammatory bowel syndrome and autism has not been consistent so far. Furthermore, some do-it-yourself cases have ended in severe infection of the recipient. Another use of our new knowledge is in medicine. Filariasis is a sickness that causes very swollen feet and legs because of roundworm infection. When they are killed, Wolbachia bacteria inside is released, triggering inflammation and destruction of lymph nodes. So the legs get permanently swollen. Now doxycycline is used to kill the Wolbachia first, then the roundworms can be killed easily without problems. An exciting new use is the discovery that Wolbachia also renders the Aedes mosquitos less able to carry the horrible dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses. So Aedes mosquitos infected with Wolbachia have been released to the wild to displace the wild type mosquitos (because infected females preferentially mate with infected males) and dengue has been controlled. This was started in Australia called the World Mosquito Program, and is being carried out in countries such as Indonesia and Mexico. Counterintuitively, toilets that are more often scrubbed have more easily colonised by E. coli (stool bacteria that transmit gastroenteritis). A diverse microbiome allows other less vicious germs to proliferate and compete with E. coli. Hospitals are too clean thus allowing antibiotic resistant bugs to proliferate, causing nosocomial infections. Florence Nightingale had it right: opening hospital windows decrease those infections by allowing entry of a more diverse microbiome through those windows!A solid 5 star book!"

This was the perfect one!As a side note, the last year or so I've been crafting a ""microbiome diet"" for myself (originally, I thought of it more as an ""anti-inflammatory diet,"" with a high focus on anti-oxidants and various phytonutrients; meaning, lots of spices, and colorful fruits and vegetables). The main focus is to eat more plants, more variety of fiber (insoluble, soluble, resistant starch, inulin/prebiotics, etc), as well as common, traditional, probiotic foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, miso, kimchi, ""raw"" pickles, kombucha, etc). and even - counter-intuitively - some anti-bacterial foods (honey, hot peppers, grape seed extract, cinnamon, etc). I had heard of so many good correlations with having a healthy gut microbiome (reduced rates of cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, etc - as well as improved mood, mental health and possibly even IQ!), that I wanted to do something to support mine. But, the science is still pretty new, so I didn't want to do anything drastic. Eating ""healthier"" seemed like the most effective, least drastic thing I could do. Then I dropped 10 lbs and a pants size, which was totally unintentional, but I won't complain. Now I tell people that I accidentally discovered the secret to weight loss: Get your daily recommended serving of fiber! (For women, this is 25g, for men 30-37g).My recommended list of high fiber foods includes:Overnight Oats (Cocoa-PB, often with a banana)Chia Pudding (often with berries)Cocoa-Banana-Peanut Butter smoothieRoasted Chickpeas (simple seasoning: garlic/salt/cayenne)Pumpkin Seeds (in-shell)Okra Chips (Sprouts carries them)Edamame PastaGuacamoleWhole Grain BreadDark ChocolateFig Cake (Whole Foods sometimes carries this)Dark Chocolate Covered Figs (Safeway has them)Peetos (pea-based cheetos)Harvest Snaps (lentil-based puffs, Tomato Basil flavor)Avocado Sandwich (Avocado, sauerkraut, mustard, hot banana pepper rings, and smoked gouda toasted on whole grain bread)Apple Slices with Peanut ButterArtichokes (Google ""Magic Artichoke Dip"")AsparagusMushroomsLentils (TasyBite brand is good, and convenient)Meatless Crumbles (I like the Quorn brand, derived from mycelium)Nut Bars (Costco's Kirkland brand has 7g of fiber per bar, and is tasty)"

Working at a public library I handle dozens of book everyday, all of which were handled by a wide variety of peoples, and what this experience does is that it forces me to encounter ideas, perspectives, and reading habits I never would have experienced on my own. It also allows me to encounter a wide variety of microscopic organisms.Ed Yong's book is one of those beautiful love letters to science in which a writer is able to communicate their passion for the field of science. Not only this, Song is able to infect me with his passion by teaching me about the kinds of microbes that infect me on a regular basis. I Contain Multitudes is infectious though, because the passion is on every page, and by the end of this book I was spellbound by how multifaceted the study of microbiomes and microbes actually was. Like many people I thought of microbes as just germs, little organisms that existed solely to make me sick. In this book Yong got me to reconsider this position. Not only that, but Long got me to reconsider my own biology and realize that the little bugs were not just alien organisms living inside of me or on me, they were, in essence, part of me. Yong observes how an individual's microbes evolve in relation to their host, adapting or in some cases being adapted by said host. After a time it becomes clear to the reader that their microbes are not just alien organisms, but part of a long evolutionary lineage that has allowed them to become the incredible species they are today, and even when Yong is writing about the symbiosis between microbes and aphids, mosquitos, and dogs the reader constantly bombarded by his passion and his ability to see the significance of these relationships.There's so many great reasons to read this book, I'm just going to settle on the fact that the man made fecal transplants something both fascinating to read about, and also something I actually wanted to learn more about."
734,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33440429-ashish,4,"This book takes a look at the world that is lurking behind everything that we see, touch, smell and feel. It's in the food we eat, the ground we walk on, the house we live in and inside our body, in the millions. The microbes that comprise this world are capable of causing diseases but also give us medicines, they cause decay but also keep the natural cycle in place and so much more. The book is the author's love letter to this microbial world, and much like what Siddharth Mukherjee did for Cancer in ""Emperor of all Maladies"", he charters the historical and ever evolving (literally) place that they occupy in our world.The book deals with everything that we need to know about the microbial world. From how they came into existence, to the role that have played in terra forming earth as we know it, to their importance in modern medicine, the author doesn't leave any stone unturned to showcase their importance. The book is very well researched and references numerous studies to back up it's claims. Yong is clearly super passionate about this stuff and in this he might seem to oversell the product, but he exercises restraint, bringing in a dose of a reality check as he remains quite optimistic about some of the tremendously far reaching applications that microbes can have on us and the society. It draws from a number of fields as the reach of the microbial world is quite far, from the depth of the ocean a mile or more below the surface, to the coldest and hottest regions knows to man, to the human gut, to the insides of a termite, we get a broad outlook on the amount of research that has goes into and still does into them.A really good book, which could have been edited a little better to keep the pace up, but still managed to keep you hooked. It's a must read for nature lovers, for those interested in science and who want to stay informed about the possibilities that the future holds for mankind."
735,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4017921-mckenzie,4,"This is my kind of science book: an approachable introduction to a previously confusing specialty, taking its title from Walt Whitman of all places. Ed Yong sees the poetry in microbiology, and shares that vision with his readers while explaining the history of our understanding of bacteria, the surprising ways bacteria interact with their environments and hosts, and the medical possibilities as we come to understand our own microbiomes. While my interest in Yong's topic lagged during the sections focusing mostly on insects, the sections about the environment and human interactions were most fascinating for me. I learned, among other things, that human babies do not have the microbes they need to be healthy until they pass through the birth canal and are breastfed; that certain bacteria have been shown to counteract or prevent inflammation of the sort associated with multiple sclerosis, at least in mice; that fecal transplants are a real thing that doctors prescribe to reset the gut bacteria of people with certain diseases; and most excitingly, that we could be heading towards a future where doctors prescribe us bacteria concoctions to alleviate medical problems, the way they today prescribe antibiotics. If any of this interests you, you should read I Contain Multitudes. It's not quite on the same level of awe as Emperor of All Maladies, but considering that I've been walking around happily envisioning the trillions of bacteria I interact with every day at work, at home, with my cat, and with my friends, I'd say this is a book that can certainly teach anyone something, and change the way you view our natural world.

Maybe a few too many corny jokes, but even those are endearing. Biggest problem was the tremendous amount of vivisection described very cavalierly; this book is largely about the results of animal research and isn't remotely concerned with the ethics of that.Even the narrative mindset is way too human-centric for me. Example that made me boggle the most: frog-killing fungus epidemic is described as terrible for ""frog lovers"" rather than for terrible for frogs. Oh, many of the endnotes are well worth reading! Lots of little enlightening and entertaining tidbits mixed in with the drier stuff. "

I liked the book, but frankly it wasn't until the last three chapters that I found a narrative. Perhaps that is because I am less interested in a collection of facts about what we do and do not (more the latter than the former) about microbes, and more interested in how this translates into practical application. I wouldn't recommend listening to this one in audiobook. You will feel more like someone is reading you a list than someone is telling you about story, and thus I think it loses some of its wonder."

749,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Individuality is a cherished trait of sagacious beings. Man is the only such animal which is conscious of its self. Man stands alone in his mental transactions with the outside world. This aloofness is way off the true state of things. Very small microbes and other inanimate objects thrive in our body and are present in very large numbers on all our body parts. The presence of microbes is thought to be a bad thing in routine awareness sermons, but this is not necessarily so. Microbes are beneficial or neutral to us on most of the occasions and provide immense service to us. They keep our guts healthy, calibrate our immune systems, make us less sensitive to allergens and can even exert influence on our brains. This horde of microbes in our body makes each individual human being a multitude which acts in tandem to work as a symbiotic whole. Ed Yong is an award-winning science writer who regularly contributes to leading journals and scientific publications.The author makes a brilliant comparison scheme to present the contrast between life forms almost perennially lived on earth against others who are relatively latecomers to the party of life. He equates our planet’s entire life to a human year in which the present is just before midnight on December 31. On such a scale, the entry of humans was just half an hour ago, at 11.30 pm, while microbes ruled the globe between the months of March to October, that is, between their entry and the advent of higher organisms. This ingenuous example clarifies all doubts on the antiquity of microbes as compared to mammals or other higher forms of life.Microbes are everywhere, but due to the very small size of them, they remained invisible to mankind till the seventeenth century. It was then Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a pioneering lens-maker in Holland, witnessed these organisms everywhere – in water, in hand tools, in his body, home and everywhere! For a time, others couldn’t make lenses with the resolving power as Leeuwenhoek’s, but when at last they did, the scholars were shocked to find themselves colonized by these microbes. It took nearly another century to distinguish the good from the bad. Many microbes live in symbiosis with their hosts. It can also be said that microbes help us become what we are by modifying the genes of parent organisms in subtle ways. Biologists have experimentally demonstrated that organisms that live in sterile Lab-like environments where the microbes are strictly controlled suffer growth problems in the absence of friendly bacteria. Yong includes examples where the microbes affect the growth of brain. Specific strains of bacteria can be encouraged with the help of probiotics (the reverse process as antibiotics). Lack of exposure to symbiotic microbes had resulted in depression and anxiety in the hosts.The book argues that the sharp distinction between good and bad microbes is an oversimplification. Even the good ones create life-threatening situations when their position is changed, say from the gut to the blood stream. Mitochondria are present in every mammal cell, which generates the energy the cell so dearly needs. Scientists presume that mitochondria were independent microbes in the beginning of life and later settled inside the animal cell in a case of mutually beneficial symbiosis. Even with a history of living together for billions of years, if the mitochondrion is to enter the blood stream somehow, the immune system of the host attacks it with vigour as if it was a foreign particle and not a part of its own body. Yong presents the case of Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium in our gut that causes ulcer and stomach cancer. A very bad guy, obviously. But what will happen if we kill all of them in our guts? Scientists warn that we are in for more trouble, as these bacteria also protects against oesophageal cancer! As in life, it is a fine line that separates the good from the ugly in the case of microbes as well.The clever ways in which mothers help their babies grow microbes in their guts is interesting to read. The author has used many scientific terms to describe the process, but one such case is very noteworthy. Human breast milk contains a family of chemicals called Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO) which can’t be digested by the infant! Why on earth are such chemicals present in mother’s milk? The shocking answer is that these are good for a specific species of bacteria in the child’s long intestine. HMO nourishes these microbes, which in turn produces short-chain fatty acids. These feed the infant’s gut cells by making adhesive proteins that seal the gap between gut cells and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system. Needless to say, babies nurtured with bottled milk don’t develop this familiarity of the immune system to microbes. This results in inflammations where the immune system overreacts even to benign external particles. The book also speculates that microbes control obesity. Obese people have more Firmicutes and fewer Bacteroidetes than their leaner counterparts in their stomach. Transferring these microbes among lab mice showed that those mice which received microbes that characterized obesity put in more weight and vice versa. There is, however, no assurance that this result can be repeated in humans.Do you remember the scary day when New Scientist magazine trumpeted on its cover that Darwin was wrong? It talked about a system of gene transfer which is horizontal, that is, from one individual to another without any reproductive act called Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). This differed with the vertical scheme Darwin had in mind, that is, from parent to offspring. The devil was in the details, and if you had read the whole article, it emphasized Darwin’s theorem rather than upsetting it. But for those who judge a book by its cover, it presented an avoidable opportunity to score on the supposed ‘error’ in Darwinism. HGT is widely seen in the world of microbes. Yong presents the curious case of the ‘nori’ seaweed that is a delicacy in Japan. Humans normally can’t digest the seaweed as the gut bacteria are unable to process them. But those who ate them first ingested marine bacteria skilled in the job. It exchanged genes with normal gut bacteria and entered its genome. Then it proceeded to colonize people via the normal biome transfer between parent and child.In the latter chapters of the book, the author describes about several revolutionary techniques of healing with bacteria, which are generally interesting but revolting at times. The faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) techniques may provide a fast cure for stomach-related issues, but it shows that a microbiologist’s career is not always glamorous! Manipulating the microbiome of an entire region or a person is discussed at length, but Yong tactfully stops short of anticipating repercussions that may arise when one plays with an entire biome. If the author is to be believed – and there are many solid reasons to do so – microbes are definitely going to play a significant part in formulating the therapies of the future. The book is neatly written and displays the confidence of the author in the beneficence of what he describes to mankind. A number of colour plates add to the visual appeal. A good number of Notes and a comprehensive index enhance the utility of the book.The book is highly recommended."

I Contain Multitudes
. This book changed all of that. Starting with a short introduction to our history with the microorganisms we share our world with, to evaluating how our relationship with them have evolved over the decades, and filled with wonderfully curious and startling facts and discoveries not just about the microbes themselves, but of their roles in our health, development and future; several chapters into this book, I felt like I was seeing and thinking about microbes everywhere, in relation to everything. This book not only opened my eyes to the ubiquitous and brilliant nature of microbes, it gave me a newfound appreciation for the ones who cohabit my body – millions and millions of tiny little creatures that have turned me into a living, dynamic ecosystem. While having a basic understanding of microbiology did help make it easier to understand the information in this book, the language has been made accessible even to audiences without any scientific background. Ed Young has a true gift for writing – his strength lies in his ability to fashion clever, easily-comprehensible analogies in order to break down complex biological systems and theories.

We've only had a couple centuries to learn how to think about them, and all the metaphors we've developed in that time are based on some thin gropings in a world much older and more complex than we've realized until very recently. So part of Yong's goal is to introduce some of the research that brings us into that new world, and another part is to confront some of those metaphors and show how inadequate they are in light of that new evidence. There's not much of a thesis or a structure here; Yong is a great science writer and has covered a lot of research in articles, and this book feels like a series of those articles strung together around loosely related themes.

There are enough examples that this picture starts to become clear, but I'm wanting a more explicit statement of how these things work in the aggregate. Because the example systems he covers make it quite clear that microbial communities occupy, to a greater or lesser extent, pretty much every surface and volume we ever interact with. And we still seem to only have the faintest idea what any of that actually means--what they do, how they're determined, etc. Part of the problem here is that, again, while it may be feasible to take samples and use genetic analysis to characterize what's present, that doesn't really mean anything to us. It's easy for us to think in terms of animal metaphors, or landscapes, to grasp the impact of an invasive plant or the extinction of a major predator. We can visualize it, and all the players have some kind of innate personality. Even things that have names and a known role may simply do something completely different in another place. Maybe that work has been done (Wolbachia, for instance, seems to have a fairly wide knowledge base). But in the context of this book, there are some odd juxtapositions. Yong will talk about how important it is for us to have the right communities of gut microbiota, and how an organism isn't a pathogen or a mutualist except under the right circumstances. But then in other places he'll describe particular microbes as opportunistic and weedy species that thrive in over-cleaned environments and how this state is dysbiotic and unhealthy. I guess I'm just wanting to know more about particular pathogenic species now, which are presumably especially well-studied? "

Read this if you are very scared of germs and desire a sterile environment everywhere. This ground breaking book introduced to readers the world of microbiome, or world of microbes living inside other organisms. So there are bacteria everywhere on the surface and inside the gut of animals. They serve many critical functions: providing fluorescence for squids for camouflaging them from creatures below them. They live in termites’ stomach and digest wood fibres. They help kill pathogenic viruses and bacteria so protect the host. Breast milk provides food for benign gut bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis that protects us from diarrhoea. They secrete mucus lining our gut that enables virus (bacteriophages) that kills harmful bacteria! They co-evolve with their hosts. This symbiosis is not always benign, but is based on mutual advantage. Some animals hosts certain bacteria in the larval stage but discard them once they grow up to be adults. Even our own gut microbiome changes with time, sometimes within days. Animals growing up in a sterile environment behave strangely and are prone to funny diseases. Babies acquire their first microbiome in the mothers’ birth canal and thus normal birth is still better than caesarean section. Rampant antibiotic use destroys our diverse microbiome, allowing bad bugs to overgrow. Probiotics help but they cannot stay long in our gut. Animals routinely eat each other’s stools to acquire its microbiome. Some clostridium difficile bacteria are so resistant that no antibiotics can kill them. Fecal transplant (yes transfer of stools) have been used successfully to cure patients of clostridium infection and has been approved by FDA. Unfortunately the effects on other illnesses such as inflammatory bowel syndrome and autism has not been consistent so far. Furthermore, some do-it-yourself cases have ended in severe infection of the recipient. Another use of our new knowledge is in medicine. Filariasis is a sickness that causes very swollen feet and legs because of roundworm infection. When they are killed, Wolbachia bacteria inside is released, triggering inflammation and destruction of lymph nodes. So the legs get permanently swollen. Now doxycycline is used to kill the Wolbachia first, then the roundworms can be killed easily without problems. An exciting new use is the discovery that Wolbachia also renders the Aedes mosquitos less able to carry the horrible dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses. So Aedes mosquitos infected with Wolbachia have been released to the wild to displace the wild type mosquitos (because infected females preferentially mate with infected males) and dengue has been controlled. This was started in Australia called the World Mosquito Program, and is being carried out in countries such as Indonesia and Mexico. Counterintuitively, toilets that are more often scrubbed have more easily colonised by E. coli (stool bacteria that transmit gastroenteritis). A diverse microbiome allows other less vicious germs to proliferate and compete with E. coli. Hospitals are too clean thus allowing antibiotic resistant bugs to proliferate, causing nosocomial infections. Florence Nightingale had it right: opening hospital windows decrease those infections by allowing entry of a more diverse microbiome through those windows!A solid 5 star book!"

This was the perfect one!As a side note, the last year or so I've been crafting a ""microbiome diet"" for myself (originally, I thought of it more as an ""anti-inflammatory diet,"" with a high focus on anti-oxidants and various phytonutrients; meaning, lots of spices, and colorful fruits and vegetables). The main focus is to eat more plants, more variety of fiber (insoluble, soluble, resistant starch, inulin/prebiotics, etc), as well as common, traditional, probiotic foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, miso, kimchi, ""raw"" pickles, kombucha, etc). and even - counter-intuitively - some anti-bacterial foods (honey, hot peppers, grape seed extract, cinnamon, etc). I had heard of so many good correlations with having a healthy gut microbiome (reduced rates of cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, etc - as well as improved mood, mental health and possibly even IQ!), that I wanted to do something to support mine. But, the science is still pretty new, so I didn't want to do anything drastic. Eating ""healthier"" seemed like the most effective, least drastic thing I could do. Then I dropped 10 lbs and a pants size, which was totally unintentional, but I won't complain. Now I tell people that I accidentally discovered the secret to weight loss: Get your daily recommended serving of fiber! (For women, this is 25g, for men 30-37g).My recommended list of high fiber foods includes:Overnight Oats (Cocoa-PB, often with a banana)Chia Pudding (often with berries)Cocoa-Banana-Peanut Butter smoothieRoasted Chickpeas (simple seasoning: garlic/salt/cayenne)Pumpkin Seeds (in-shell)Okra Chips (Sprouts carries them)Edamame PastaGuacamoleWhole Grain BreadDark ChocolateFig Cake (Whole Foods sometimes carries this)Dark Chocolate Covered Figs (Safeway has them)Peetos (pea-based cheetos)Harvest Snaps (lentil-based puffs, Tomato Basil flavor)Avocado Sandwich (Avocado, sauerkraut, mustard, hot banana pepper rings, and smoked gouda toasted on whole grain bread)Apple Slices with Peanut ButterArtichokes (Google ""Magic Artichoke Dip"")AsparagusMushroomsLentils (TasyBite brand is good, and convenient)Meatless Crumbles (I like the Quorn brand, derived from mycelium)Nut Bars (Costco's Kirkland brand has 7g of fiber per bar, and is tasty)"

Working at a public library I handle dozens of book everyday, all of which were handled by a wide variety of peoples, and what this experience does is that it forces me to encounter ideas, perspectives, and reading habits I never would have experienced on my own. It also allows me to encounter a wide variety of microscopic organisms.Ed Yong's book is one of those beautiful love letters to science in which a writer is able to communicate their passion for the field of science. Not only this, Song is able to infect me with his passion by teaching me about the kinds of microbes that infect me on a regular basis. I Contain Multitudes is infectious though, because the passion is on every page, and by the end of this book I was spellbound by how multifaceted the study of microbiomes and microbes actually was. Like many people I thought of microbes as just germs, little organisms that existed solely to make me sick. In this book Yong got me to reconsider this position. Not only that, but Long got me to reconsider my own biology and realize that the little bugs were not just alien organisms living inside of me or on me, they were, in essence, part of me. Yong observes how an individual's microbes evolve in relation to their host, adapting or in some cases being adapted by said host. After a time it becomes clear to the reader that their microbes are not just alien organisms, but part of a long evolutionary lineage that has allowed them to become the incredible species they are today, and even when Yong is writing about the symbiosis between microbes and aphids, mosquitos, and dogs the reader constantly bombarded by his passion and his ability to see the significance of these relationships.There's so many great reasons to read this book, I'm just going to settle on the fact that the man made fecal transplants something both fascinating to read about, and also something I actually wanted to learn more about."
764,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33440429-ashish,4,"This book takes a look at the world that is lurking behind everything that we see, touch, smell and feel. It's in the food we eat, the ground we walk on, the house we live in and inside our body, in the millions. The microbes that comprise this world are capable of causing diseases but also give us medicines, they cause decay but also keep the natural cycle in place and so much more. The book is the author's love letter to this microbial world, and much like what Siddharth Mukherjee did for Cancer in ""Emperor of all Maladies"", he charters the historical and ever evolving (literally) place that they occupy in our world.The book deals with everything that we need to know about the microbial world. From how they came into existence, to the role that have played in terra forming earth as we know it, to their importance in modern medicine, the author doesn't leave any stone unturned to showcase their importance. The book is very well researched and references numerous studies to back up it's claims. Yong is clearly super passionate about this stuff and in this he might seem to oversell the product, but he exercises restraint, bringing in a dose of a reality check as he remains quite optimistic about some of the tremendously far reaching applications that microbes can have on us and the society. It draws from a number of fields as the reach of the microbial world is quite far, from the depth of the ocean a mile or more below the surface, to the coldest and hottest regions knows to man, to the human gut, to the insides of a termite, we get a broad outlook on the amount of research that has goes into and still does into them.A really good book, which could have been edited a little better to keep the pace up, but still managed to keep you hooked. It's a must read for nature lovers, for those interested in science and who want to stay informed about the possibilities that the future holds for mankind."
765,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4017921-mckenzie,4,"This is my kind of science book: an approachable introduction to a previously confusing specialty, taking its title from Walt Whitman of all places. Ed Yong sees the poetry in microbiology, and shares that vision with his readers while explaining the history of our understanding of bacteria, the surprising ways bacteria interact with their environments and hosts, and the medical possibilities as we come to understand our own microbiomes. While my interest in Yong's topic lagged during the sections focusing mostly on insects, the sections about the environment and human interactions were most fascinating for me. I learned, among other things, that human babies do not have the microbes they need to be healthy until they pass through the birth canal and are breastfed; that certain bacteria have been shown to counteract or prevent inflammation of the sort associated with multiple sclerosis, at least in mice; that fecal transplants are a real thing that doctors prescribe to reset the gut bacteria of people with certain diseases; and most excitingly, that we could be heading towards a future where doctors prescribe us bacteria concoctions to alleviate medical problems, the way they today prescribe antibiotics. If any of this interests you, you should read I Contain Multitudes. It's not quite on the same level of awe as Emperor of All Maladies, but considering that I've been walking around happily envisioning the trillions of bacteria I interact with every day at work, at home, with my cat, and with my friends, I'd say this is a book that can certainly teach anyone something, and change the way you view our natural world.

Maybe a few too many corny jokes, but even those are endearing. Biggest problem was the tremendous amount of vivisection described very cavalierly; this book is largely about the results of animal research and isn't remotely concerned with the ethics of that.Even the narrative mindset is way too human-centric for me. Example that made me boggle the most: frog-killing fungus epidemic is described as terrible for ""frog lovers"" rather than for terrible for frogs. Oh, many of the endnotes are well worth reading! Lots of little enlightening and entertaining tidbits mixed in with the drier stuff. "

I liked the book, but frankly it wasn't until the last three chapters that I found a narrative. Perhaps that is because I am less interested in a collection of facts about what we do and do not (more the latter than the former) about microbes, and more interested in how this translates into practical application. I wouldn't recommend listening to this one in audiobook. You will feel more like someone is reading you a list than someone is telling you about story, and thus I think it loses some of its wonder."

Man stands alone in his mental transactions with the outside world. This aloofness is way off the true state of things. Very small microbes and other inanimate objects thrive in our body and are present in very large numbers on all our body parts. The presence of microbes is thought to be a bad thing in routine awareness sermons, but this is not necessarily so. Microbes are beneficial or neutral to us on most of the occasions and provide immense service to us. They keep our guts healthy, calibrate our immune systems, make us less sensitive to allergens and can even exert influence on our brains. This horde of microbes in our body makes each individual human being a multitude which acts in tandem to work as a symbiotic whole. Ed Yong is an award-winning science writer who regularly contributes to leading journals and scientific publications.The author makes a brilliant comparison scheme to present the contrast between life forms almost perennially lived on earth against others who are relatively latecomers to the party of life. He equates our planet’s entire life to a human year in which the present is just before midnight on December 31. On such a scale, the entry of humans was just half an hour ago, at 11.30 pm, while microbes ruled the globe between the months of March to October, that is, between their entry and the advent of higher organisms. This ingenuous example clarifies all doubts on the antiquity of microbes as compared to mammals or other higher forms of life.Microbes are everywhere, but due to the very small size of them, they remained invisible to mankind till the seventeenth century. It was then Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a pioneering lens-maker in Holland, witnessed these organisms everywhere – in water, in hand tools, in his body, home and everywhere! For a time, others couldn’t make lenses with the resolving power as Leeuwenhoek’s, but when at last they did, the scholars were shocked to find themselves colonized by these microbes. It took nearly another century to distinguish the good from the bad. Many microbes live in symbiosis with their hosts. It can also be said that microbes help us become what we are by modifying the genes of parent organisms in subtle ways. Biologists have experimentally demonstrated that organisms that live in sterile Lab-like environments where the microbes are strictly controlled suffer growth problems in the absence of friendly bacteria. Yong includes examples where the microbes affect the growth of brain. Specific strains of bacteria can be encouraged with the help of probiotics (the reverse process as antibiotics). Lack of exposure to symbiotic microbes had resulted in depression and anxiety in the hosts.The book argues that the sharp distinction between good and bad microbes is an oversimplification. Even the good ones create life-threatening situations when their position is changed, say from the gut to the blood stream. Mitochondria are present in every mammal cell, which generates the energy the cell so dearly needs. Scientists presume that mitochondria were independent microbes in the beginning of life and later settled inside the animal cell in a case of mutually beneficial symbiosis. Even with a history of living together for billions of years, if the mitochondrion is to enter the blood stream somehow, the immune system of the host attacks it with vigour as if it was a foreign particle and not a part of its own body. Yong presents the case of Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium in our gut that causes ulcer and stomach cancer. A very bad guy, obviously. But what will happen if we kill all of them in our guts? Scientists warn that we are in for more trouble, as these bacteria also protects against oesophageal cancer! As in life, it is a fine line that separates the good from the ugly in the case of microbes as well.The clever ways in which mothers help their babies grow microbes in their guts is interesting to read. The author has used many scientific terms to describe the process, but one such case is very noteworthy. Human breast milk contains a family of chemicals called Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO) which can’t be digested by the infant! Why on earth are such chemicals present in mother’s milk? The shocking answer is that these are good for a specific species of bacteria in the child’s long intestine. HMO nourishes these microbes, which in turn produces short-chain fatty acids. These feed the infant’s gut cells by making adhesive proteins that seal the gap between gut cells and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system. Needless to say, babies nurtured with bottled milk don’t develop this familiarity of the immune system to microbes. This results in inflammations where the immune system overreacts even to benign external particles. The book also speculates that microbes control obesity. Obese people have more Firmicutes and fewer Bacteroidetes than their leaner counterparts in their stomach. Transferring these microbes among lab mice showed that those mice which received microbes that characterized obesity put in more weight and vice versa. There is, however, no assurance that this result can be repeated in humans.Do you remember the scary day when New Scientist magazine trumpeted on its cover that Darwin was wrong? It talked about a system of gene transfer which is horizontal, that is, from one individual to another without any reproductive act called Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). This differed with the vertical scheme Darwin had in mind, that is, from parent to offspring. The devil was in the details, and if you had read the whole article, it emphasized Darwin’s theorem rather than upsetting it. But for those who judge a book by its cover, it presented an avoidable opportunity to score on the supposed ‘error’ in Darwinism. HGT is widely seen in the world of microbes. Yong presents the curious case of the ‘nori’ seaweed that is a delicacy in Japan. Humans normally can’t digest the seaweed as the gut bacteria are unable to process them. But those who ate them first ingested marine bacteria skilled in the job. It exchanged genes with normal gut bacteria and entered its genome. Then it proceeded to colonize people via the normal biome transfer between parent and child.In the latter chapters of the book, the author describes about several revolutionary techniques of healing with bacteria, which are generally interesting but revolting at times. The faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) techniques may provide a fast cure for stomach-related issues, but it shows that a microbiologist’s career is not always glamorous! Manipulating the microbiome of an entire region or a person is discussed at length, but Yong tactfully stops short of anticipating repercussions that may arise when one plays with an entire biome. If the author is to be believed – and there are many solid reasons to do so – microbes are definitely going to play a significant part in formulating the therapies of the future. The book is neatly written and displays the confidence of the author in the beneficence of what he describes to mankind. A number of colour plates add to the visual appeal. A good number of Notes and a comprehensive index enhance the utility of the book.The book is highly recommended."

I Contain Multitudes
. This book changed all of that. Starting with a short introduction to our history with the microorganisms we share our world with, to evaluating how our relationship with them have evolved over the decades, and filled with wonderfully curious and startling facts and discoveries not just about the microbes themselves, but of their roles in our health, development and future; several chapters into this book, I felt like I was seeing and thinking about microbes everywhere, in relation to everything. This book not only opened my eyes to the ubiquitous and brilliant nature of microbes, it gave me a newfound appreciation for the ones who cohabit my body – millions and millions of tiny little creatures that have turned me into a living, dynamic ecosystem. While having a basic understanding of microbiology did help make it easier to understand the information in this book, the language has been made accessible even to audiences without any scientific background. Ed Young has a true gift for writing – his strength lies in his ability to fashion clever, easily-comprehensible analogies in order to break down complex biological systems and theories. This book is also brimming with humour and passion. I particularly enjoyed the section at the end regarding synthetic biology and the potential for “microbial medicine” in our future.

790,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,4,"Microbes are a cultural novelty. We've only had a couple centuries to learn how to think about them, and all the metaphors we've developed in that time are based on some thin gropings in a world much older and more complex than we've realized until very recently. So part of Yong's goal is to introduce some of the research that brings us into that new world, and another part is to confront some of those metaphors and show how inadequate they are in light of that new evidence. There's not much of a thesis or a structure here; Yong is a great science writer and has covered a lot of research in articles, and this book feels like a series of those articles strung together around loosely related themes. A lot of that research is really amazing. I thought I was pretty hip to the microbiome stuff and had a sense of how important microbial ecology was. But there were still lots of revelations left for me here. The fundamental role of microbes in shaping animal development, for instance, or the enormous spectrum of what Wolbachia does in insect biology. There are two big ideas running through all of these stories. One is the extended phenotype: the idea that organisms inherit genes that code for their own bodies but also for compounds that shape the environment of other organisms. While Yong lets scientists waffle over the precise utility of the term ""hologenome"" for the genes of an organism and its symbionts (since the jobs must be done but often the organisms that do them can vary tremendously). But there are dozens of stories of particular organisms outsourcing development and maintenance work to their symbionts, and eventually even acquiring them as part of their own genome. The line between symbiont and host is blurred in a dozen different ways.The other idea, which is somewhat more profound if more obvious and intuitive in retrospect, is that microbial ecology isn't magic. It's subject to the same concepts we use to describe other ecological systems, if with some major differences in the particulars. I've had this vague notion that microbes are sort of everywhere, all the time, and that they can always find substrates as soon as they exist, that they can form dormant bodies that can tolerate extended periods without resources, etc. This seems to be an exaggeration; ultimately, microbial ecology functions just like plant ecology or insect ecology: the community present is determined by available propagules and environmental niches (available resources, competitors, temperature and pH, etc). This is where Yong's book left me wanting more. There are enough examples that this picture starts to become clear, but I'm wanting a more explicit statement of how these things work in the aggregate. Because the example systems he covers make it quite clear that microbial communities occupy, to a greater or lesser extent, pretty much every surface and volume we ever interact with. And we still seem to only have the faintest idea what any of that actually means--what they do, how they're determined, etc. Part of the problem here is that, again, while it may be feasible to take samples and use genetic analysis to characterize what's present, that doesn't really mean anything to us. It's easy for us to think in terms of animal metaphors, or landscapes, to grasp the impact of an invasive plant or the extinction of a major predator. We can visualize it, and all the players have some kind of innate personality. Even things that have names and a known role may simply do something completely different in another place. Maybe that work has been done (Wolbachia, for instance, seems to have a fairly wide knowledge base). But in the context of this book, there are some odd juxtapositions. Yong will talk about how important it is for us to have the right communities of gut microbiota, and how an organism isn't a pathogen or a mutualist except under the right circumstances. But then in other places he'll describe particular microbes as opportunistic and weedy species that thrive in over-cleaned environments and how this state is dysbiotic and unhealthy. I guess I'm just wanting to know more about particular pathogenic species now, which are presumably especially well-studied? "
791,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"Read this book if you are a doctor, nurse or public health official. Read this if you are an architect or botanist. Read this if you are very scared of germs and desire a sterile environment everywhere. This ground breaking book introduced to readers the world of microbiome, or world of microbes living inside other organisms. So there are bacteria everywhere on the surface and inside the gut of animals. They serve many critical functions: providing fluorescence for squids for camouflaging them from creatures below them. They live in termites’ stomach and digest wood fibres. They help kill pathogenic viruses and bacteria so protect the host. Breast milk provides food for benign gut bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis that protects us from diarrhoea. They secrete mucus lining our gut that enables virus (bacteriophages) that kills harmful bacteria! They co-evolve with their hosts. This symbiosis is not always benign, but is based on mutual advantage. Some animals hosts certain bacteria in the larval stage but discard them once they grow up to be adults. Even our own gut microbiome changes with time, sometimes within days. Animals growing up in a sterile environment behave strangely and are prone to funny diseases. Babies acquire their first microbiome in the mothers’ birth canal and thus normal birth is still better than caesarean section. Rampant antibiotic use destroys our diverse microbiome, allowing bad bugs to overgrow. Probiotics help but they cannot stay long in our gut. Animals routinely eat each other’s stools to acquire its microbiome. Some clostridium difficile bacteria are so resistant that no antibiotics can kill them. Fecal transplant (yes transfer of stools) have been used successfully to cure patients of clostridium infection and has been approved by FDA. Unfortunately the effects on other illnesses such as inflammatory bowel syndrome and autism has not been consistent so far. Furthermore, some do-it-yourself cases have ended in severe infection of the recipient. Another use of our new knowledge is in medicine. Filariasis is a sickness that causes very swollen feet and legs because of roundworm infection. When they are killed, Wolbachia bacteria inside is released, triggering inflammation and destruction of lymph nodes. So the legs get permanently swollen. Now doxycycline is used to kill the Wolbachia first, then the roundworms can be killed easily without problems. An exciting new use is the discovery that Wolbachia also renders the Aedes mosquitos less able to carry the horrible dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses. So Aedes mosquitos infected with Wolbachia have been released to the wild to displace the wild type mosquitos (because infected females preferentially mate with infected males) and dengue has been controlled. This was started in Australia called the World Mosquito Program, and is being carried out in countries such as Indonesia and Mexico. Counterintuitively, toilets that are more often scrubbed have more easily colonised by E. coli (stool bacteria that transmit gastroenteritis). A diverse microbiome allows other less vicious germs to proliferate and compete with E. coli. Hospitals are too clean thus allowing antibiotic resistant bugs to proliferate, causing nosocomial infections. Florence Nightingale had it right: opening hospital windows decrease those infections by allowing entry of a more diverse microbiome through those windows!A solid 5 star book!"

This was the perfect one!As a side note, the last year or so I've been crafting a ""microbiome diet"" for myself (originally, I thought of it more as an ""anti-inflammatory diet,"" with a high focus on anti-oxidants and various phytonutrients; meaning, lots of spices, and colorful fruits and vegetables). The main focus is to eat more plants, more variety of fiber (insoluble, soluble, resistant starch, inulin/prebiotics, etc), as well as common, traditional, probiotic foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, miso, kimchi, ""raw"" pickles, kombucha, etc). and even - counter-intuitively - some anti-bacterial foods (honey, hot peppers, grape seed extract, cinnamon, etc). I had heard of so many good correlations with having a healthy gut microbiome (reduced rates of cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, etc - as well as improved mood, mental health and possibly even IQ!), that I wanted to do something to support mine. But, the science is still pretty new, so I didn't want to do anything drastic. Eating ""healthier"" seemed like the most effective, least drastic thing I could do. Then I dropped 10 lbs and a pants size, which was totally unintentional, but I won't complain. Now I tell people that I accidentally discovered the secret to weight loss: Get your daily recommended serving of fiber! (For women, this is 25g, for men 30-37g).My recommended list of high fiber foods includes:Overnight Oats (Cocoa-PB, often with a banana)Chia Pudding (often with berries)Cocoa-Banana-Peanut Butter smoothieRoasted Chickpeas (simple seasoning: garlic/salt/cayenne)Pumpkin Seeds (in-shell)Okra Chips (Sprouts carries them)Edamame PastaGuacamoleWhole Grain BreadDark ChocolateFig Cake (Whole Foods sometimes carries this)Dark Chocolate Covered Figs (Safeway has them)Peetos (pea-based cheetos)Harvest Snaps (lentil-based puffs, Tomato Basil flavor)Avocado Sandwich (Avocado, sauerkraut, mustard, hot banana pepper rings, and smoked gouda toasted on whole grain bread)Apple Slices with Peanut ButterArtichokes (Google ""Magic Artichoke Dip"")AsparagusMushroomsLentils (TasyBite brand is good, and convenient)Meatless Crumbles (I like the Quorn brand, derived from mycelium)Nut Bars (Costco's Kirkland brand has 7g of fiber per bar, and is tasty)"

Working at a public library I handle dozens of book everyday, all of which were handled by a wide variety of peoples, and what this experience does is that it forces me to encounter ideas, perspectives, and reading habits I never would have experienced on my own. It also allows me to encounter a wide variety of microscopic organisms.Ed Yong's book is one of those beautiful love letters to science in which a writer is able to communicate their passion for the field of science. Not only this, Song is able to infect me with his passion by teaching me about the kinds of microbes that infect me on a regular basis. I Contain Multitudes is infectious though, because the passion is on every page, and by the end of this book I was spellbound by how multifaceted the study of microbiomes and microbes actually was. Like many people I thought of microbes as just germs, little organisms that existed solely to make me sick. In this book Yong got me to reconsider this position. Not only that, but Long got me to reconsider my own biology and realize that the little bugs were not just alien organisms living inside of me or on me, they were, in essence, part of me. Yong observes how an individual's microbes evolve in relation to their host, adapting or in some cases being adapted by said host. After a time it becomes clear to the reader that their microbes are not just alien organisms, but part of a long evolutionary lineage that has allowed them to become the incredible species they are today, and even when Yong is writing about the symbiosis between microbes and aphids, mosquitos, and dogs the reader constantly bombarded by his passion and his ability to see the significance of these relationships.There's so many great reasons to read this book, I'm just going to settle on the fact that the man made fecal transplants something both fascinating to read about, and also something I actually wanted to learn more about."
794,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33440429-ashish,4,"This book takes a look at the world that is lurking behind everything that we see, touch, smell and feel. It's in the food we eat, the ground we walk on, the house we live in and inside our body, in the millions. The microbes that comprise this world are capable of causing diseases but also give us medicines, they cause decay but also keep the natural cycle in place and so much more. The book is the author's love letter to this microbial world, and much like what Siddharth Mukherjee did for Cancer in ""Emperor of all Maladies"", he charters the historical and ever evolving (literally) place that they occupy in our world.The book deals with everything that we need to know about the microbial world. From how they came into existence, to the role that have played in terra forming earth as we know it, to their importance in modern medicine, the author doesn't leave any stone unturned to showcase their importance. The book is very well researched and references numerous studies to back up it's claims. Yong is clearly super passionate about this stuff and in this he might seem to oversell the product, but he exercises restraint, bringing in a dose of a reality check as he remains quite optimistic about some of the tremendously far reaching applications that microbes can have on us and the society. It draws from a number of fields as the reach of the microbial world is quite far, from the depth of the ocean a mile or more below the surface, to the coldest and hottest regions knows to man, to the human gut, to the insides of a termite, we get a broad outlook on the amount of research that has goes into and still does into them.A really good book, which could have been edited a little better to keep the pace up, but still managed to keep you hooked. It's a must read for nature lovers, for those interested in science and who want to stay informed about the possibilities that the future holds for mankind."
795,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4017921-mckenzie,4,"This is my kind of science book: an approachable introduction to a previously confusing specialty, taking its title from Walt Whitman of all places. Ed Yong sees the poetry in microbiology, and shares that vision with his readers while explaining the history of our understanding of bacteria, the surprising ways bacteria interact with their environments and hosts, and the medical possibilities as we come to understand our own microbiomes. While my interest in Yong's topic lagged during the sections focusing mostly on insects, the sections about the environment and human interactions were most fascinating for me. I learned, among other things, that human babies do not have the microbes they need to be healthy until they pass through the birth canal and are breastfed; that certain bacteria have been shown to counteract or prevent inflammation of the sort associated with multiple sclerosis, at least in mice; that fecal transplants are a real thing that doctors prescribe to reset the gut bacteria of people with certain diseases; and most excitingly, that we could be heading towards a future where doctors prescribe us bacteria concoctions to alleviate medical problems, the way they today prescribe antibiotics. If any of this interests you, you should read I Contain Multitudes. It's not quite on the same level of awe as Emperor of All Maladies, but considering that I've been walking around happily envisioning the trillions of bacteria I interact with every day at work, at home, with my cat, and with my friends, I'd say this is a book that can certainly teach anyone something, and change the way you view our natural world.

Maybe a few too many corny jokes, but even those are endearing. Biggest problem was the tremendous amount of vivisection described very cavalierly; this book is largely about the results of animal research and isn't remotely concerned with the ethics of that.Even the narrative mindset is way too human-centric for me. Example that made me boggle the most: frog-killing fungus epidemic is described as terrible for ""frog lovers"" rather than for terrible for frogs. Oh, many of the endnotes are well worth reading! Lots of little enlightening and entertaining tidbits mixed in with the drier stuff. "

I liked the book, but frankly it wasn't until the last three chapters that I found a narrative. Perhaps that is because I am less interested in a collection of facts about what we do and do not (more the latter than the former) about microbes, and more interested in how this translates into practical application. I wouldn't recommend listening to this one in audiobook. You will feel more like someone is reading you a list than someone is telling you about story, and thus I think it loses some of its wonder."

809,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Individuality is a cherished trait of sagacious beings. Man is the only such animal which is conscious of its self. Man stands alone in his mental transactions with the outside world. This aloofness is way off the true state of things. Very small microbes and other inanimate objects thrive in our body and are present in very large numbers on all our body parts. The presence of microbes is thought to be a bad thing in routine awareness sermons, but this is not necessarily so. Microbes are beneficial or neutral to us on most of the occasions and provide immense service to us. They keep our guts healthy, calibrate our immune systems, make us less sensitive to allergens and can even exert influence on our brains. This horde of microbes in our body makes each individual human being a multitude which acts in tandem to work as a symbiotic whole. Ed Yong is an award-winning science writer who regularly contributes to leading journals and scientific publications.The author makes a brilliant comparison scheme to present the contrast between life forms almost perennially lived on earth against others who are relatively latecomers to the party of life. He equates our planet’s entire life to a human year in which the present is just before midnight on December 31. On such a scale, the entry of humans was just half an hour ago, at 11.30 pm, while microbes ruled the globe between the months of March to October, that is, between their entry and the advent of higher organisms. This ingenuous example clarifies all doubts on the antiquity of microbes as compared to mammals or other higher forms of life.Microbes are everywhere, but due to the very small size of them, they remained invisible to mankind till the seventeenth century. It was then Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a pioneering lens-maker in Holland, witnessed these organisms everywhere – in water, in hand tools, in his body, home and everywhere! For a time, others couldn’t make lenses with the resolving power as Leeuwenhoek’s, but when at last they did, the scholars were shocked to find themselves colonized by these microbes. It took nearly another century to distinguish the good from the bad. Many microbes live in symbiosis with their hosts. It can also be said that microbes help us become what we are by modifying the genes of parent organisms in subtle ways. Biologists have experimentally demonstrated that organisms that live in sterile Lab-like environments where the microbes are strictly controlled suffer growth problems in the absence of friendly bacteria. Yong includes examples where the microbes affect the growth of brain. Specific strains of bacteria can be encouraged with the help of probiotics (the reverse process as antibiotics). Lack of exposure to symbiotic microbes had resulted in depression and anxiety in the hosts.The book argues that the sharp distinction between good and bad microbes is an oversimplification. Even the good ones create life-threatening situations when their position is changed, say from the gut to the blood stream. Mitochondria are present in every mammal cell, which generates the energy the cell so dearly needs. Scientists presume that mitochondria were independent microbes in the beginning of life and later settled inside the animal cell in a case of mutually beneficial symbiosis. Even with a history of living together for billions of years, if the mitochondrion is to enter the blood stream somehow, the immune system of the host attacks it with vigour as if it was a foreign particle and not a part of its own body. Yong presents the case of Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium in our gut that causes ulcer and stomach cancer. A very bad guy, obviously. But what will happen if we kill all of them in our guts? Scientists warn that we are in for more trouble, as these bacteria also protects against oesophageal cancer! As in life, it is a fine line that separates the good from the ugly in the case of microbes as well.The clever ways in which mothers help their babies grow microbes in their guts is interesting to read. The author has used many scientific terms to describe the process, but one such case is very noteworthy. Human breast milk contains a family of chemicals called Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO) which can’t be digested by the infant! Why on earth are such chemicals present in mother’s milk? The shocking answer is that these are good for a specific species of bacteria in the child’s long intestine. HMO nourishes these microbes, which in turn produces short-chain fatty acids. These feed the infant’s gut cells by making adhesive proteins that seal the gap between gut cells and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system. Needless to say, babies nurtured with bottled milk don’t develop this familiarity of the immune system to microbes. This results in inflammations where the immune system overreacts even to benign external particles. The book also speculates that microbes control obesity. Obese people have more Firmicutes and fewer Bacteroidetes than their leaner counterparts in their stomach. Transferring these microbes among lab mice showed that those mice which received microbes that characterized obesity put in more weight and vice versa. There is, however, no assurance that this result can be repeated in humans.Do you remember the scary day when New Scientist magazine trumpeted on its cover that Darwin was wrong? It talked about a system of gene transfer which is horizontal, that is, from one individual to another without any reproductive act called Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). This differed with the vertical scheme Darwin had in mind, that is, from parent to offspring. The devil was in the details, and if you had read the whole article, it emphasized Darwin’s theorem rather than upsetting it. But for those who judge a book by its cover, it presented an avoidable opportunity to score on the supposed ‘error’ in Darwinism. HGT is widely seen in the world of microbes. Yong presents the curious case of the ‘nori’ seaweed that is a delicacy in Japan. Humans normally can’t digest the seaweed as the gut bacteria are unable to process them. But those who ate them first ingested marine bacteria skilled in the job. It exchanged genes with normal gut bacteria and entered its genome. Then it proceeded to colonize people via the normal biome transfer between parent and child.In the latter chapters of the book, the author describes about several revolutionary techniques of healing with bacteria, which are generally interesting but revolting at times. The faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) techniques may provide a fast cure for stomach-related issues, but it shows that a microbiologist’s career is not always glamorous! Manipulating the microbiome of an entire region or a person is discussed at length, but Yong tactfully stops short of anticipating repercussions that may arise when one plays with an entire biome. If the author is to be believed – and there are many solid reasons to do so – microbes are definitely going to play a significant part in formulating the therapies of the future. The book is neatly written and displays the confidence of the author in the beneficence of what he describes to mankind. A number of colour plates add to the visual appeal. A good number of Notes and a comprehensive index enhance the utility of the book.The book is highly recommended."

I Contain Multitudes
. This book changed all of that. Starting with a short introduction to our history with the microorganisms we share our world with, to evaluating how our relationship with them have evolved over the decades, and filled with wonderfully curious and startling facts and discoveries not just about the microbes themselves, but of their roles in our health, development and future; several chapters into this book, I felt like I was seeing and thinking about microbes everywhere, in relation to everything. This book not only opened my eyes to the ubiquitous and brilliant nature of microbes, it gave me a newfound appreciation for the ones who cohabit my body – millions and millions of tiny little creatures that have turned me into a living, dynamic ecosystem. While having a basic understanding of microbiology did help make it easier to understand the information in this book, the language has been made accessible even to audiences without any scientific background. Ed Young has a true gift for writing – his strength lies in his ability to fashion clever, easily-comprehensible analogies in order to break down complex biological systems and theories. This book is also brimming with humour and passion. I particularly enjoyed the section at the end regarding synthetic biology and the potential for “microbial medicine” in our future.

820,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,4,"Microbes are a cultural novelty. We've only had a couple centuries to learn how to think about them, and all the metaphors we've developed in that time are based on some thin gropings in a world much older and more complex than we've realized until very recently. So part of Yong's goal is to introduce some of the research that brings us into that new world, and another part is to confront some of those metaphors and show how inadequate they are in light of that new evidence. There's not much of a thesis or a structure here; Yong is a great science writer and has covered a lot of research in articles, and this book feels like a series of those articles strung together around loosely related themes. A lot of that research is really amazing. I thought I was pretty hip to the microbiome stuff and had a sense of how important microbial ecology was. But there were still lots of revelations left for me here. The fundamental role of microbes in shaping animal development, for instance, or the enormous spectrum of what Wolbachia does in insect biology. There are two big ideas running through all of these stories. One is the extended phenotype: the idea that organisms inherit genes that code for their own bodies but also for compounds that shape the environment of other organisms. While Yong lets scientists waffle over the precise utility of the term ""hologenome"" for the genes of an organism and its symbionts (since the jobs must be done but often the organisms that do them can vary tremendously). But there are dozens of stories of particular organisms outsourcing development and maintenance work to their symbionts, and eventually even acquiring them as part of their own genome. The line between symbiont and host is blurred in a dozen different ways.The other idea, which is somewhat more profound if more obvious and intuitive in retrospect, is that microbial ecology isn't magic. It's subject to the same concepts we use to describe other ecological systems, if with some major differences in the particulars. I've had this vague notion that microbes are sort of everywhere, all the time, and that they can always find substrates as soon as they exist, that they can form dormant bodies that can tolerate extended periods without resources, etc. This seems to be an exaggeration; ultimately, microbial ecology functions just like plant ecology or insect ecology: the community present is determined by available propagules and environmental niches (available resources, competitors, temperature and pH, etc). This is where Yong's book left me wanting more. There are enough examples that this picture starts to become clear, but I'm wanting a more explicit statement of how these things work in the aggregate. Because the example systems he covers make it quite clear that microbial communities occupy, to a greater or lesser extent, pretty much every surface and volume we ever interact with. And we still seem to only have the faintest idea what any of that actually means--what they do, how they're determined, etc. Part of the problem here is that, again, while it may be feasible to take samples and use genetic analysis to characterize what's present, that doesn't really mean anything to us. It's easy for us to think in terms of animal metaphors, or landscapes, to grasp the impact of an invasive plant or the extinction of a major predator. We can visualize it, and all the players have some kind of innate personality. Even things that have names and a known role may simply do something completely different in another place. Maybe that work has been done (Wolbachia, for instance, seems to have a fairly wide knowledge base). But in the context of this book, there are some odd juxtapositions. Yong will talk about how important it is for us to have the right communities of gut microbiota, and how an organism isn't a pathogen or a mutualist except under the right circumstances. But then in other places he'll describe particular microbes as opportunistic and weedy species that thrive in over-cleaned environments and how this state is dysbiotic and unhealthy. I guess I'm just wanting to know more about particular pathogenic species now, which are presumably especially well-studied? "

Even our own gut microbiome changes with time, sometimes within days. Animals growing up in a sterile environment behave strangely and are prone to funny diseases. Babies acquire their first microbiome in the mothers’ birth canal and thus normal birth is still better than caesarean section. Rampant antibiotic use destroys our diverse microbiome, allowing bad bugs to overgrow. Probiotics help but they cannot stay long in our gut. Animals routinely eat each other’s stools to acquire its microbiome. Some clostridium difficile bacteria are so resistant that no antibiotics can kill them. Fecal transplant (yes transfer of stools) have been used successfully to cure patients of clostridium infection and has been approved by FDA. Unfortunately the effects on other illnesses such as inflammatory bowel syndrome and autism has not been consistent so far. Furthermore, some do-it-yourself cases have ended in severe infection of the recipient. Another use of our new knowledge is in medicine. Filariasis is a sickness that causes very swollen feet and legs because of roundworm infection. When they are killed, Wolbachia bacteria inside is released, triggering inflammation and destruction of lymph nodes. So the legs get permanently swollen. Now doxycycline is used to kill the Wolbachia first, then the roundworms can be killed easily without problems. An exciting new use is the discovery that Wolbachia also renders the Aedes mosquitos less able to carry the horrible dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses. So Aedes mosquitos infected with Wolbachia have been released to the wild to displace the wild type mosquitos (because infected females preferentially mate with infected males) and dengue has been controlled. This was started in Australia called the World Mosquito Program, and is being carried out in countries such as Indonesia and Mexico. Counterintuitively, toilets that are more often scrubbed have more easily colonised by E. coli (stool bacteria that transmit gastroenteritis). A diverse microbiome allows other less vicious germs to proliferate and compete with E. coli. Hospitals are too clean thus allowing antibiotic resistant bugs to proliferate, causing nosocomial infections. Florence Nightingale had it right: opening hospital windows decrease those infections by allowing entry of a more diverse microbiome through those windows!A solid 5 star book!"

This was the perfect one!As a side note, the last year or so I've been crafting a ""microbiome diet"" for myself (originally, I thought of it more as an ""anti-inflammatory diet,"" with a high focus on anti-oxidants and various phytonutrients; meaning, lots of spices, and colorful fruits and vegetables). The main focus is to eat more plants, more variety of fiber (insoluble, soluble, resistant starch, inulin/prebiotics, etc), as well as common, traditional, probiotic foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, miso, kimchi, ""raw"" pickles, kombucha, etc). and even - counter-intuitively - some anti-bacterial foods (honey, hot peppers, grape seed extract, cinnamon, etc). I had heard of so many good correlations with having a healthy gut microbiome (reduced rates of cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, etc - as well as improved mood, mental health and possibly even IQ!), that I wanted to do something to support mine. But, the science is still pretty new, so I didn't want to do anything drastic. Eating ""healthier"" seemed like the most effective, least drastic thing I could do. Then I dropped 10 lbs and a pants size, which was totally unintentional, but I won't complain. Now I tell people that I accidentally discovered the secret to weight loss: Get your daily recommended serving of fiber! (For women, this is 25g, for men 30-37g).My recommended list of high fiber foods includes:Overnight Oats (Cocoa-PB, often with a banana)Chia Pudding (often with berries)Cocoa-Banana-Peanut Butter smoothieRoasted Chickpeas (simple seasoning: garlic/salt/cayenne)Pumpkin Seeds (in-shell)Okra Chips (Sprouts carries them)Edamame PastaGuacamoleWhole Grain BreadDark ChocolateFig Cake (Whole Foods sometimes carries this)Dark Chocolate Covered Figs (Safeway has them)Peetos (pea-based cheetos)Harvest Snaps (lentil-based puffs, Tomato Basil flavor)Avocado Sandwich (Avocado, sauerkraut, mustard, hot banana pepper rings, and smoked gouda toasted on whole grain bread)Apple Slices with Peanut ButterArtichokes (Google ""Magic Artichoke Dip"")AsparagusMushroomsLentils (TasyBite brand is good, and convenient)Meatless Crumbles (I like the Quorn brand, derived from mycelium)Nut Bars (Costco's Kirkland brand has 7g of fiber per bar, and is tasty)"

Working at a public library I handle dozens of book everyday, all of which were handled by a wide variety of peoples, and what this experience does is that it forces me to encounter ideas, perspectives, and reading habits I never would have experienced on my own. It also allows me to encounter a wide variety of microscopic organisms.Ed Yong's book is one of those beautiful love letters to science in which a writer is able to communicate their passion for the field of science. Not only this, Song is able to infect me with his passion by teaching me about the kinds of microbes that infect me on a regular basis. I Contain Multitudes is infectious though, because the passion is on every page, and by the end of this book I was spellbound by how multifaceted the study of microbiomes and microbes actually was. Like many people I thought of microbes as just germs, little organisms that existed solely to make me sick. In this book Yong got me to reconsider this position. Not only that, but Long got me to reconsider my own biology and realize that the little bugs were not just alien organisms living inside of me or on me, they were, in essence, part of me. Yong observes how an individual's microbes evolve in relation to their host, adapting or in some cases being adapted by said host. After a time it becomes clear to the reader that their microbes are not just alien organisms, but part of a long evolutionary lineage that has allowed them to become the incredible species they are today, and even when Yong is writing about the symbiosis between microbes and aphids, mosquitos, and dogs the reader constantly bombarded by his passion and his ability to see the significance of these relationships.There's so many great reasons to read this book, I'm just going to settle on the fact that the man made fecal transplants something both fascinating to read about, and also something I actually wanted to learn more about."
824,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33440429-ashish,4,"This book takes a look at the world that is lurking behind everything that we see, touch, smell and feel. It's in the food we eat, the ground we walk on, the house we live in and inside our body, in the millions. The microbes that comprise this world are capable of causing diseases but also give us medicines, they cause decay but also keep the natural cycle in place and so much more. The book is the author's love letter to this microbial world, and much like what Siddharth Mukherjee did for Cancer in ""Emperor of all Maladies"", he charters the historical and ever evolving (literally) place that they occupy in our world.The book deals with everything that we need to know about the microbial world. From how they came into existence, to the role that have played in terra forming earth as we know it, to their importance in modern medicine, the author doesn't leave any stone unturned to showcase their importance. The book is very well researched and references numerous studies to back up it's claims. Yong is clearly super passionate about this stuff and in this he might seem to oversell the product, but he exercises restraint, bringing in a dose of a reality check as he remains quite optimistic about some of the tremendously far reaching applications that microbes can have on us and the society. It draws from a number of fields as the reach of the microbial world is quite far, from the depth of the ocean a mile or more below the surface, to the coldest and hottest regions knows to man, to the human gut, to the insides of a termite, we get a broad outlook on the amount of research that has goes into and still does into them.A really good book, which could have been edited a little better to keep the pace up, but still managed to keep you hooked. It's a must read for nature lovers, for those interested in science and who want to stay informed about the possibilities that the future holds for mankind."
825,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4017921-mckenzie,4,"This is my kind of science book: an approachable introduction to a previously confusing specialty, taking its title from Walt Whitman of all places. Ed Yong sees the poetry in microbiology, and shares that vision with his readers while explaining the history of our understanding of bacteria, the surprising ways bacteria interact with their environments and hosts, and the medical possibilities as we come to understand our own microbiomes. While my interest in Yong's topic lagged during the sections focusing mostly on insects, the sections about the environment and human interactions were most fascinating for me. I learned, among other things, that human babies do not have the microbes they need to be healthy until they pass through the birth canal and are breastfed; that certain bacteria have been shown to counteract or prevent inflammation of the sort associated with multiple sclerosis, at least in mice; that fecal transplants are a real thing that doctors prescribe to reset the gut bacteria of people with certain diseases; and most excitingly, that we could be heading towards a future where doctors prescribe us bacteria concoctions to alleviate medical problems, the way they today prescribe antibiotics. If any of this interests you, you should read I Contain Multitudes. It's not quite on the same level of awe as Emperor of All Maladies, but considering that I've been walking around happily envisioning the trillions of bacteria I interact with every day at work, at home, with my cat, and with my friends, I'd say this is a book that can certainly teach anyone something, and change the way you view our natural world.

The other reviewers on Goodreads gave excellent overviews of this book. I could not add anything to match their erudite writings. Suffice to say, this book changed the way I looked at the world.

Maybe a few too many corny jokes, but even those are endearing. Biggest problem was the tremendous amount of vivisection described very cavalierly; this book is largely about the results of animal research and isn't remotely concerned with the ethics of that.Even the narrative mindset is way too human-centric for me. Example that made me boggle the most: frog-killing fungus epidemic is described as terrible for ""frog lovers"" rather than for terrible for frogs. Oh, many of the endnotes are well worth reading! Lots of little enlightening and entertaining tidbits mixed in with the drier stuff. "

I liked the book, but frankly it wasn't until the last three chapters that I found a narrative. Perhaps that is because I am less interested in a collection of facts about what we do and do not (more the latter than the former) about microbes, and more interested in how this translates into practical application. I wouldn't recommend listening to this one in audiobook. You will feel more like someone is reading you a list than someone is telling you about story, and thus I think it loses some of its wonder."

Man stands alone in his mental transactions with the outside world. This aloofness is way off the true state of things. Very small microbes and other inanimate objects thrive in our body and are present in very large numbers on all our body parts. The presence of microbes is thought to be a bad thing in routine awareness sermons, but this is not necessarily so. Microbes are beneficial or neutral to us on most of the occasions and provide immense service to us. They keep our guts healthy, calibrate our immune systems, make us less sensitive to allergens and can even exert influence on our brains. This horde of microbes in our body makes each individual human being a multitude which acts in tandem to work as a symbiotic whole. Ed Yong is an award-winning science writer who regularly contributes to leading journals and scientific publications.The author makes a brilliant comparison scheme to present the contrast between life forms almost perennially lived on earth against others who are relatively latecomers to the party of life. He equates our planet’s entire life to a human year in which the present is just before midnight on December 31. On such a scale, the entry of humans was just half an hour ago, at 11.30 pm, while microbes ruled the globe between the months of March to October, that is, between their entry and the advent of higher organisms. This ingenuous example clarifies all doubts on the antiquity of microbes as compared to mammals or other higher forms of life.Microbes are everywhere, but due to the very small size of them, they remained invisible to mankind till the seventeenth century. It was then Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a pioneering lens-maker in Holland, witnessed these organisms everywhere – in water, in hand tools, in his body, home and everywhere! For a time, others couldn’t make lenses with the resolving power as Leeuwenhoek’s, but when at last they did, the scholars were shocked to find themselves colonized by these microbes. It took nearly another century to distinguish the good from the bad. Many microbes live in symbiosis with their hosts. It can also be said that microbes help us become what we are by modifying the genes of parent organisms in subtle ways. Biologists have experimentally demonstrated that organisms that live in sterile Lab-like environments where the microbes are strictly controlled suffer growth problems in the absence of friendly bacteria. Yong includes examples where the microbes affect the growth of brain. Specific strains of bacteria can be encouraged with the help of probiotics (the reverse process as antibiotics). Lack of exposure to symbiotic microbes had resulted in depression and anxiety in the hosts.The book argues that the sharp distinction between good and bad microbes is an oversimplification. Even the good ones create life-threatening situations when their position is changed, say from the gut to the blood stream. Mitochondria are present in every mammal cell, which generates the energy the cell so dearly needs. Scientists presume that mitochondria were independent microbes in the beginning of life and later settled inside the animal cell in a case of mutually beneficial symbiosis. Even with a history of living together for billions of years, if the mitochondrion is to enter the blood stream somehow, the immune system of the host attacks it with vigour as if it was a foreign particle and not a part of its own body. Yong presents the case of Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium in our gut that causes ulcer and stomach cancer. A very bad guy, obviously. But what will happen if we kill all of them in our guts? Scientists warn that we are in for more trouble, as these bacteria also protects against oesophageal cancer! As in life, it is a fine line that separates the good from the ugly in the case of microbes as well.The clever ways in which mothers help their babies grow microbes in their guts is interesting to read. The author has used many scientific terms to describe the process, but one such case is very noteworthy. Human breast milk contains a family of chemicals called Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO) which can’t be digested by the infant! Why on earth are such chemicals present in mother’s milk? The shocking answer is that these are good for a specific species of bacteria in the child’s long intestine. HMO nourishes these microbes, which in turn produces short-chain fatty acids. These feed the infant’s gut cells by making adhesive proteins that seal the gap between gut cells and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system. Needless to say, babies nurtured with bottled milk don’t develop this familiarity of the immune system to microbes. This results in inflammations where the immune system overreacts even to benign external particles. The book also speculates that microbes control obesity. Obese people have more Firmicutes and fewer Bacteroidetes than their leaner counterparts in their stomach. Transferring these microbes among lab mice showed that those mice which received microbes that characterized obesity put in more weight and vice versa. There is, however, no assurance that this result can be repeated in humans.Do you remember the scary day when New Scientist magazine trumpeted on its cover that Darwin was wrong? It talked about a system of gene transfer which is horizontal, that is, from one individual to another without any reproductive act called Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). This differed with the vertical scheme Darwin had in mind, that is, from parent to offspring. The devil was in the details, and if you had read the whole article, it emphasized Darwin’s theorem rather than upsetting it. But for those who judge a book by its cover, it presented an avoidable opportunity to score on the supposed ‘error’ in Darwinism. HGT is widely seen in the world of microbes. Yong presents the curious case of the ‘nori’ seaweed that is a delicacy in Japan. Humans normally can’t digest the seaweed as the gut bacteria are unable to process them. But those who ate them first ingested marine bacteria skilled in the job. It exchanged genes with normal gut bacteria and entered its genome. Then it proceeded to colonize people via the normal biome transfer between parent and child.In the latter chapters of the book, the author describes about several revolutionary techniques of healing with bacteria, which are generally interesting but revolting at times. The faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) techniques may provide a fast cure for stomach-related issues, but it shows that a microbiologist’s career is not always glamorous! Manipulating the microbiome of an entire region or a person is discussed at length, but Yong tactfully stops short of anticipating repercussions that may arise when one plays with an entire biome. If the author is to be believed – and there are many solid reasons to do so – microbes are definitely going to play a significant part in formulating the therapies of the future. The book is neatly written and displays the confidence of the author in the beneficence of what he describes to mankind. A number of colour plates add to the visual appeal. A good number of Notes and a comprehensive index enhance the utility of the book.The book is highly recommended."
840,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"I did not expect to like this book very much. After reading the hype and the blurb I expected a dumbed down account of how microbes influence every aspect of our lives and all the ways we can control them. I knew that research in this area was very fresh, and that conclusions in this field are pretty hard to come by, so I was afraid of reading a distorted picture of the science for the sake of sensationalism.And, in fact, the book had that exact optimistic tone that I was dreading. Something along the lines of: “Scientists hope that in 5 years they can use bacteria to disintegrate plastic and clean the oceans!” But the content is not the one-size-fits-all dollop of one extraordinary fact after another. As with other good books of scientific journalism, the content is a stream of experimental results and hypotheses, some more likely than others, and labeled as such. Yes, you could have bacteria eating plastic out of the oceans, but not yet. Yes, microbes do influence a great part of our development, because apparently the microbiome is the environmental element responsible for activating certain genes and also training the immune system (bye bye germs, hello allergies). But we are still trying to understand what elements are causing this and if any intervention on our part does more good than bad.And with a sexy title like this, it’s bound to be eye-catching. I’ve seen it compared to The Selfish Gene and The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World on the publisher’s website. While, to my mind, Dawkins’ book is something which one could rightly compare only to a select few books, like “The Origin of Species”, Pollan’s book of scientific journalism is an apt comparison. Highly recommended reading material."

Traditionally, we think of microbes as tiny invaders that make us sick and, as I sit at home after yet another day of social distancing, it is easy to see it that way.But, Yong takes us into a more complicated world. A world where microbes actually benefit their larger hosts - where microbes can help produce scents or colors for attracting a mate, help guts break down leaves or nuts and even help their hosts survive poisons. In many cases, these microbes and their hosts co-evolved and have become dependent on one another. They have created their own microbiome.But, it's not that simple, either. Sometimes the microbes affect their host's behavior - and not in a good way. They can turn insects into virtual zombies, they can make mice hyperactive or depressed. They can even make mice suicidal (there is a microbe that resides in the guts of cats. It makes mice confuse the smell of cat with the smell of a mouse that is ready to mate. The mouse runs to the cat, gets eaten and the microbe is happily deposited in the gut of a cat. )Yong's real message is...Read more at: https://dwdsreviews.blogspot.com/2020..."

I now know not to waste my money on probiotics and not to exaggerate with cleanliness (though I'll probably get laxer on that once corona is gone). I've learned my bacteria can attract mosquitoes and make me sick. They depend on me and I depend on them, so we should try to get along.But it's not just about people, the book showcases a series of case studies in nature about how bacteria change behaviors, body shapes, and even entire species.

From a footnote in the first chapter: ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars."" We drop them off and pick them up continually. We trail clouds of microbes as we come. All animals do. It's amazing to consider we are but a very small subset of life on this planet. I can only imagine how Leeuwenhoek felt when he first gazed on these tiny ""animalcules.""The pace of discovery with regard to genetics has been breathtaking lately, and the application to microbial life is exciting. The symbiotic relationship between animals and their microbiome is amazing. However, I wouldn't go so far as to say that ""microbes subvert our notions of individuality."" (p. 24) That struck me as reductionistic. We're surely more than the sum of cellular processes, bacterial or otherwise.Note well: if your habit is to read over lunch, as is mine, this book selection might better be reserved for another time.

The topic is interesting as I don’t have more than a basic understanding of microbes. The pacing was ok, no real wasted words or sections here. But, the writing often set my teeth on edge…especially at the beginning…I almost gave up on the book then and there. But, it got mostly better. However, the bad poetry writing cropped up enough to annoy me and spoil parts of the rest of the book. Still, I learned quite a bit about microbes and their impact on the world. So, while my expectations were met info wise, the writing was disappointing. That said, I give this book a 3.

That statement is only partly true. But the idea of getting rid of all the microbes around us is thought that needs to be reevaluated. Ed Yong in this book provides a fresh perspective towards microbes, with fascinating (and sometimes gross) experiments and facts about how all animals and plants have evolved to work along with microbes to build immunity, digest foods they otherwise can't digest, avoid and cure diseases. We are so dependent on microbes for our survival that even the milk that humans produce for babies contains components to nurture our gut bacteria. However, the old school thought has led to abuse of anti-biotics and hyper-sanitation leading to the destruction of friendly microbes, an increase in inflammatory diseases, and superbugs! There are only a few microbes that are pathogens, while the majority are a necessary part of the ecosystem, some of which are actively leveraged as probiotics, be it to improve digestion or neutralize mosquitos from spreading diseases. We live in a world of microbes, and we're a world of microbes. P.S. Occasionally, a few topics fail to hold your attention, but the book rewards patience with lots of interesting facts again."

I'm glad I bought it because I'll refer back to chapters for sure.I started researching gut inflammation and the microbiome in 2011 when IBS hit hard. All the research I was looking at during that time for the massive bouts of joint inflammation I had pointed to gut health and I considered some very drastic measures to try and change things.I changed my diet completely to try and bring some of the inflammation down naturally and I'm still learning and fine tuning to avoid a full blowout of IBD.Every person is uniquely different. This helped me understand the mind/gut connection and has given me more ideas for research. Fascinating stuff in this gem of a book.

But it doesn't mean the work Ed Yong has put in to introduce us to the microworld is not comment worthy. Initially seeing that the book came from a scientific writer and not from a scientist itself made me a little sceptic to go on.. But i think he made me understand that his writing is non biased which a scientist's work cud have been because he/she definitely would have tried to forward his/her outlook while Yong took in to consideration every aspect of the subject. A must read if u want to understand the life on earth at its full capacity.... after reading this when u say ""me"" u will be meaning something different than what u meant before.."
850,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117593-laila-bigreadinglife,4,"I won’t pretend that I understood every sentence in this book about the fascinating and omnipresent world of microbes. But I really enjoyed it! I don’t think I ever grasped just how much microbes influence animal and human behavior and biology. Or how much we depend on them for good health. This isn’t all about humans either - really interesting stuff about corals, frogs, insects, and all kinds of other wildlife. I recommend both the audio book and the paper version. I had to switch from one to the other midway. "
851,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67653846-mckenna-clarke,4,"I think it’s important every once in a while to read a book that reminds you how much you don’t know. This book was definitely a little over my head in some parts, and I don’t think I would have gone through it if I hadn’t gotten it on audiobook. I am really glad I read it though, and I was truly fascinated by the microbial world within us that literally keeps us alive every single day. I especially loved the sections that talked about the microbial properties of human milk and how mothers pass on their microbiome to their babies. "
852,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1260126-tim,4,"Pitched as a book that would do for microbes what Dawkins did for genes, it doesn't quite hit that mark. Along with moments that can be both enlightening and frightening, there are parts of the book that feel mundane and trying too hard to be extraordinary. It's does succeed at being an easily digestible exploration of a field that is poorly understood and, as the book makes clear, unfairly maligned. You will learn a lot."
853,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113788851-vaida,5,"If you are looking for some nerdy book to lullaby you to sleep - this book most definitely ain’t it. As a person, who had a basic ‘there’s good and bad bacteria’ knowledge, I was glued to the book, soaking in the most jaw-dropping, on occasion discussing, newest findings on the lives of bacteria and the massive influence they posses over their hosts. It’s a science book wrapped up in the most beautiful metaphors. So not only did it open up a whole exciting world of partnerships and treacheries of microorganisms, but it also made for a smooth and, I’d say, pretty romantic literature. "
854,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17181-jill,5,"Ecstatic nerdy eloquent science writing about tiny creatures that live everywhere and touch everything. If you watched that Northern Exposure episode where Maggie and Joel learn about dust mites, it’s that, for 265 pages. So good."
855,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45117643-sylvie-helen,5,"This was so good. I'm not sure what possessed me to put it down nearly two years ago but I'm glad I picked it back up and finished it. Who knew microbes were so completely fascinating? Ed Yong, probably."
856,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13081984-badger-smith,4,Fascinating but above my head and more facts than I can remember. May be deserving of 5*.
857,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43943565-eli,5,"i learned a lot from this book, most notably that there's a citrus mealybug bacteria named after the professor i work for!"
858,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32665569-bhupinder-saini,4,"5 stars for the book. 3 stars for the (audible) audiobook. It feels like they recorded the whole book into two different studios, but the parts were all jumbled up. So the quality of the recording kept changing every 5 minutes."
859,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22395236-merih,5,"I am not going to shut up about this book for a while. The book and the microbes are mind-blowing, breathtaking, brilliant!!!!"
860,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57432835-mila,4,This book contains many fascinating stories about the microbes in our bodies and other animals. Not every chapter was equally interesting and some were way too complicated for me but I definitely found out some exciting and disgusting stuff about these tiny creatures.
861,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94440776-brad-henderson,3,Fascinating book and I learned a lot. Quite technical with some of the language which made it a bit of a slow read at times.
862,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11550691-robert,5,"I Contain Multitudes is one of the best books I've read so far in the areas of the microbiome/microbiota, genomics, genetics, and evolution. It's a powerful counter to the War on Bacteria and the abuse of antibiotics. Yong is an incredibly skillful writer, knowing just when to deftly balance precise scientific detail with clever humor."
863,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89652862-gulcin,3,"This is a really good book, I learned a lot about microbiome and microbes. But maybe because of the subject matter, I got really bored from time to time and had hard time following the detailed information. You don't have to be a microbiologist to be interested in the topic but I guess being a social scientist prevented me from enjoying the book :/"
864,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16376683-will-huntley,5,"This book is absolutely incredible. It's relatively hard to read, but so worth it; it will change how you see the world."
865,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1541374-joe,5,So. Good. My friends are glad I’ve finished this book because they think I’ll maybe stfu about it. They’re wrong.
866,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18838479-andrew-davis,4,"Review: A fascinating story of bacteria cohabitating with humans, plants and other animals. Corrects a myth that we have many more bacteria than our own human cells. Contains numerous examples of symbiosis with bacteria. Suggests that two bacteria combined together and this led to our cells containing mitochondria. Very up to date with the latest developments and interestingly presented.Notes:All eukaryotes pack almost all their DNA into a central nucleus and have mitochondria, which provides cell with chemical energy.It is believed that they were created about 2.5 billion years ago, when bacterium merged with an archaeon. The archaeon provided the chassis of the eukaryotic cell while the bacterium eventually transformed into the mitochondria. Our genomes contain genes that have an archaeal and bacterial character.The latest estimates suggest that we have around 30 trillion human cells and 39 microbial ones. Our cells carry between 20 to 25 thousand genes, but microbes inside us contain around 500 times more.The bacteria don’t physically reshape the gut themselves. Instead they teach the gut cells how to use their own genes to make a healthy gut. This has been demonstrated with mice and gut bacterium called Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.The stomach bacterium Helicobacter pylori causes ulcers, but also protects against oesophageal cancer.The soil-dwelling microbe called Bacillus thuringiensis produces toxins that can kill insects by punching holes in their guts. Farmers explored it since 1920 by spraying it onto crops.A cut or bruise can split some of our cells apart and spill fragments of mitochondria into our blood – fragments that still keep some of their ancient bacterial character. When our immune system spots them, it mistakenly assumes that an infection is under way and mounts a strong defence. This can lead to a lethal condition called systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which can be worse than the original injury.There is a special group of cells, called a bacteriocyte (Greek for bacteria cell), which accommodate bacteria. Up to a fifth of insect species contain them. They can control and use bacteria to their own good.Viruses called bacteriophages (literally ‘eaters of bacteria’), or phages for short, look like the lunar lander and can be found in our intestines. They keep our microbes in check.The bacteria in our gut almost all belong to four major groups, out of hundreds that exist in the wild. They are Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria.Mitochondria were once free-living bacteria that became permanently enclosed within a larger cell. This process known as endosymbiosis was accepted thanks to Lynn Margulis. She argued that ""Natural selection eliminates and maybe maintains, but it doesn't create"", and maintained that symbiosis was the major driver of evolutionary change.Unlike us, bacterias can transfer their DNA horizontally between each others. They can also absorb bits of DNA in their environment left by their dead or decaying neighbours. They can even rely on viruses to move genes from one cell to another. The horizontal gene transfer (HGT) allows bacteria to evolve at great speed. They don’t have to wait for the right mutations to slowly amass within their existing DNA. This leads to development of superbugs, protected against powerful antibiotics.In 2001, when the first full draft of human genome was published, it was found that of the thousands of genes identified, 223 were shared with bacteria but not with other complex organisms. They were probably present in some very early organisms and then lost in later lineages.The presence of Akkermansia muciniphilia in our gut correlates with a lower risk of obesity and malnutricion. The Bacteroides fragilis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii are anti-inflammatory bugs helping our immune system.Substances that selectively nourish beneficial microbes are called prebiotics."
867,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37385216-sushmita,5,"I haven't been able to stop talking about this book since I started it. This shit is endlessly fascinating (pun intended). I listened to this one, and the narration reminded me of Economist audio editions: a posh Englishman narrating with equal parts enthusiasm and deadpan delivery (did he just substitute re-poopulate for FMT? Yes, yes he did). If genes are the instructions, microbes are the conductors and composers of our lives. They control and coordinate EVERYTHING, and yet we know precious little about how all of this goes down. But there is indication that microbes may be the key to any number of physical and mental ailments - and why not? Contrary to popular myth, there are no good or bad bacteria - bacteria simply act according to the ecosystems and conditions around them. While nobody yet knows which combinations and compositions of microbes are ideal (if there even is an ""ideal""), diversity is key. And personally, I'm grateful for all of the dirt I swallowed as a little one. For now, you are what you eat - so eat your fiber and vegetables. Yong is a pop sci writer extraordinare, with an ability to personify microbes and bring to life the quirky scientists that have devoted their lives to this study. I'm convinced this should be turned into a graphic novel, Avengers style, but featuring BACTERIA. In the meantime, just read this."
868,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9716384-vivify-m,3,"I found the extensive information about microbes interesting. The authors balanced view, and acknowledgement of the limitations in our knowledge was appreciated. At the same time, the limited knowledge detracted from my enjoyment. I couldn't achieve the authors level of enthusiasm, when so much seemed to boil down to speculation. Still, I learned somethings and it allowed me to mentally masticate on thoughts of complex relationships.""A well-functioning partner-ship could easily be seen as a case of reciprocal exploitation. Both partners may benefit there's this inherent tension. Symbiosis is conflict."" - Toby Kiers as quoted in the book. I love reading about complex systems. Much of what we are, and experience, is the emergent property of complex systems. The interaction between our cells and the microbes that make up our body, is both fascinating and awe-inspiring to me. Plus, it was nice to get into some biology for a change. I enjoyed learning about the difference between eukaryotes and bacteria, and of the existence of archaea. Of particular interest was microbial relationships and the way our bodies manage bacteria. This sparked a lot of thoughts about society at large. But, more about that later, first…Mucus! I hadn't appreciated exactly how primordial this stuff is. We experience it mostly as something gross, or funny, maybe even erotic. But, this amazing substance is an invention from the dawn of life itself. A product of the struggle between the components of life - usually a barrier for keeping bacteria out. In super hero lore this would be a most powerful ancient relic. One of a handful of special forces preventing evil from destroying all life as we know it.Talking about societies attitude, the book uses the metaphor of a Park Ranger as an alternative to the traditionally combative approach for dealing with bacteria. This resonated with me on a larger philosophical and social level. ""Yeah! We should stop thinking about wars, period. And, start acting like stewards to all of mankind. And, get rid of borders and countries. Let's mingle and cooperate, not fight."", is how my inner voice spun off on a tangent. Interestingly I then immediately felt an increased kinship towards the book and its author. Later this amused me - How crazy is it that a perceived moral alignment would impact on my feelings towards a book about microbes. And, that’s why virtue signalling is a thing.But it wasn't just the bias that I was subject too, my entire thought pattern was fallacious. Metaphors are useful but always limiting. It's crazy to think that microbe colonies could be used as an effective model for human societies. It's so natural to latch on to something as supporting evidence of one's own belief system, without out questioning the rational.Fortunately if I hadn't caught myself, the book would have set me straight. Turns out there is no such thing as perfect harmony, even in this most ancient of life's crevices. As the book puts it symbiosis is conflict. In microbiology, every cooperative relationship is a struggle for survival, a delicate balancing act, only coincidentally magnanimous, and never far from outright conflict. I found that a sobering thought."
869,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7281396-robin,4,"I recommend this book to everyone, especially the germaphobes, in my circle. While it wasn’t an easy read, by any stretch, I enjoyed this book on so many levels. I love science and respect what scientists do. Their passion is infectious, pardon the pun. Ed Yong is an excellent writer and his use of humour helps make the various chapters accessible. And speaking of chapters, I loved how he packaged them so handily and with clever titles to help make sense of his objective for each one. I especially loved the chapter titled In Sickness and In Health, for its focus on the human biome, but really, the whole book was fascinating. I’ll never think of microbes as evil again. This book has restored my wonder in all living things visible and invisible."
