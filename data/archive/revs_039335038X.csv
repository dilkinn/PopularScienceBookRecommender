0,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a force to reckon with. But he is not Carl Sagan. While Sagan must have smiled down kindly on your meek acknowledgement of ignorance regarding, say, black holes, Tyson will have most probably given you the stink eye or aimed a sarcastic jibe at your apathy, before proceeding to explain why black holes still remain a topic of much speculation in the community of astrophysicists worldwide.Tyson does not pull any punches in this collection of essays while slamming the news media, who more often than not, come off as ill-informed hacks doing a shoddy job of reporting facts in the field of space science, forever (stupidly) claiming how scientists are baffled by so-and-so new developments. 
""Scientists cannot claim to be on the research frontier unless one thing or another baffles them. Bafflement drives discovery.""
Or snidely commenting on the Hollywood exercise of producing multi-million dollar sci-fi films which badly butcher the scientific aspects of such ventures by inserting factually incorrect observations in scenes and dialogues. (there's a brilliant anecdote concerning James Cameron's 'Titanic' in this regard and the Contact film gets an honorable mention for its adherence to proper science if one overlooks a minor gaffe)
""I am glad that, in the end, the humans win. We conquer the 'Independence Day' aliens by having a Macintosh laptop computer upload a software virus to the mothership. [] The entire defense system for the alien mothership must have been powered by the same release of Apple Computer's system software as the laptop computer that delivered the virus.""
Or criticizing the mad dash for extending the frontiers of space science during the Cold war years, when the spirit of scientific inquiry was sidelined in favor of a dangerous game of political one-upmanship, a kind of puerile assertion of 'our scientists are better than yours'. Or openly chastising revered names from ancient Greece like Aristotle whose inaccurate assumptions about the unchanging nature of stars and the geocentric universe helped the Catholic Church in propagating falsities for centuries with impunity. (He doesn't even spare Newton for God's Higgs Boson's sake who, unable to satisfactorily explain the ordered behavior of the solar system despite the many often conflicting gravitational forces at work, had cited God's need to step in to correct things in his famed 'Principia')While Sagan may have adopted a more benign, less aggressive tone in course of addressing issues of religious dogma being at loggerheads with scientific reasoning and aversion to science and mathematics among the general populace, NDT takes the approach of pure, unadulterated logic and demolishes one popular misconception after another (for e.g.:-the North Star is not the most brilliant star in the night sky or how everything that goes up doesn't come down) with a brute force which I am certain will not sit well with some sensitive readers who are easily offended. Being born in a country whose space research organization head performs pujas and makes ritualistic offerings prior to launching a 'Mission to Mars', I can't say I fault NDT's acerbic tone or his distaste for those who are hell-bent on unifying science and religion without even realizing that finding common ground between both is akin to attempting to exceed the velocity of light. But if NDT lacks Sagan's sage-like demeanour and his rich, authorial voice (Sagan's prose is much more refined no doubt), his excellent sense of humor almost compensates for their absence - 
""The good thing about the laws of physics is that they require no law enforcement agencies to maintain them, although I once owned a nerdy T-shirt that loudly proclaimed, ""OBEY GRAVITY.""

""The only people who still call hurricanes 'acts of God' are the people who write insurance forms.""
(and Michele Bachmann, just saying)And occasionally there's a sop thrown in for the literary-minded (particularly the postmodernist fiction lover) - ""The physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who in 1964 proposed the existence of quarks, and who at the time thought the quark family had only three members, drew the name from a characteristically elusive line in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake: 'Three quarks for Muster Mark!'""
The more frivolous aspects of the essays aside, among the astrophysics-related topics NDT centers his discussions around, the ones which were relatively new to me are the concepts of hypernovae, gamma ray bursts, dark matter and dark energy, the uncertainty surrounding the string theory and the probability of the annihilation of Earth through ill-fated, cosmic encounters with errant asteroids, the unavoidable, impending collision of our galaxy with the Andromeda galaxy which is the nearest one heading towards us at a speed of more than 100 kilometers per second.The Andromeda GalaxySince this is a collection of 42 essays which were published in the 'Natural History' magazine, some repetition of concepts and names creeps in occasionally but that merely helps you refresh memories of what you just read a few pages back, not exactly a shortcoming I am keen to quibble over. 4 stars, because Tyson seems a little too bitter about artists who exercise 'artistic license' to distort certain astronomical facts in their paintings. Besides I am certain there is a lot of 5-star-worthy goodness in the rest of NDT's works left for me to discover in the future."
1,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"This is a very fun read for all you science nerds... not only being clear and humorous but wide-ranging and careful to build up a number of those necessary building blocks of knowledge but doing it precisely in order to slam you with the good stuff later.Like how you'd DIE IN A BLACK HOLE... :)To belabor the obvious by the title. :)Seriously, this book gives us a ton of great ways to die and not just by black hole. I really appreciated that. :)I'd characterize this book as an easy to intermediate stage science book that's very far from being dull and it has a minimum of equations. I'm sure everyone has heard of thermodynamics and E=MC squared and Drake's equation, after all, but what really thrilled me about this was the truly wide array of subjects and Tyson's conversational tone.You can tell he is still a very, very good science teacher. :)I can almost hear him say, ""Let's throw out the crap, folks, let's dive right into the good stuff."" And he does, ranging from the Big Bang to the Heat Death, kinds of possible life on planets, the building blocks we need to understand science, including a great ""stick"" analogy for understanding the universe without computers, and he even gets into a bit of politics and religion because let's face it: it's a hot discussion item. But thankfully, it's only there as an afterthought.I wanted science and I got science, exploring the planets, the sun, even quasars, and especially Black Holes. That's the yummy stuff, after all.  10/10 Black Holes agree! Nom nom nom nom nom. I totally recommend this for both laymen and the intelligently curious and for anyone else who just likes a bit of the good (science) life. It really, really helps that Tyson's a great writer and clear as glass. The light passes right through it without slowing down at all! Can you believe it?"
2,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70078-chloe,4,"Within my skull, where all of those vital pieces of data surrounding science are supposed to be stored, there is instead a vast beaker-shaped void of ignorance. In high school, while we were supposed to be studying the musculature of the formaldehyde-soaked amphibians pinned ignominiously to their coffinesque metal trays, I was far more interested in studying the effects of adding fire to small green buds. During my brief time wandering the hallways of the University world, I was able to do away with my prerequisite requirement by taking an “Arts of Science” course tailor-made for those more interested in empathy than entropy and, while I did manage to get a crocodile on my report card, all I took away from that class was an abiding hatred for hippies. The long and the short of all this is that I didn’t know a quasar from a neutron or a brown dwarf from a red giant (though Red Dwarf was a magnificent television series).As a devout lover of science fiction and hi-tech gadgetry of all sorts, this was a matter of not a little shame for me. To resolve this I decided that it was time for me to fill in some of the (immense) gaps in my education the best way I know how- via book. Yet how to avoid having my eyes glaze over the moment someone started explaining cell structures or complex wave fields? Fortunately, as it often does, my television provided a solution when Stephen Colbert took a visit to the American Museum of Natural Historys Hayden Planetarium and spoke with its Director, Neil deGrasse Tyson. Tyson, while just as geeky as you would expect from an astrophysicist, is phenomenally skilled at taking incredibly complex scientific theories and translating them into a Common English that even Stephen Colbert is able to understand. My fate was sealed. This man was the ideal author to ease myself into the brave new world of stellar science.Death by Black Hole is a collection of essays the Tyson penned for Natural History magazine over the course of several years. Each essay addresses a different topic, running the gamut from the birth of the universe, the history of astronomical discoveries, humankind’s fixation on the red hills of Mars and the life-bringing water that may lay frozen away, all the way to the Pluto Wars (it’s amazing just how contentious Pluto’s status as planet is). Of course there’s some overlap between the chapters and some facts get repeated but, rather than bugging me, I found it to be a good refresher of what had come before that helped solidify my basic understanding of the concepts at hand. Most interesting to me, policy junkie that I am, is the closing essay in which Tyson writes about the plague of scientific ignorance sweeping the country. After almost brutally doing away with that Bible-in-textbook-clothing anachronism that is “intelligent design,” he makes great points about America’s waning prestige in scientific research and the future costs, both economic and academic, that we will have to pay due to ceding our intellectual priority to advance knowledge. I’m not much interested in sustaining American supremacy in any field, but I can always get behind an argument for strengthening education.What I most enjoyed was the excitement that Tyson has for his field. He doesn’t get bogged down in the minutiae of atomic weights and the like, but thrills at the possibilities of quantum mechanics and takes an almost excessive amount of joy in ruminating over the possible ways that people can be killed in space from the atom-splitting nullification of crossing a black hole’s event horizon to the persistent fear of a species-leveling asteroid striking Earth. Tyson is a man possessed of a childlike sense of wonder at the mysteries of the universe that sees the current limits of our scientific understanding not as having reached the final frontiers of science but as hurdles to be vaulted over in our quest to know. His enthusiasm is quite contagious and I challenge any reader to emerge from this book without being excited about science."
3,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"I have often lamented the passing of my favorite popular scientist, Carl Sagan, by talking about how necessary he is right now. We are at a point in our history where scientific illiteracy is growing, where people are not only ignorant of how science works, but are proud of their ignorance. What we need is someone who can reach the majority of Americans who are not especially scientifically literate - the people whose automatic reaction to science is to think, ""That's just too hard for me to deal with.""Enter Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and the director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. He's appeared on countless television programs, including The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, to talk about the current state of astronomy and astrophysics. He's an engaging and entertaining man, who claims that Pluto was ""asking for"" its demotion, who seems to take perverse pleasure in describing all the terrible ways the universe could take us out. He knows that we're in a precarious position, here on Earth, and he revels in it rather than worrying about it. Whereas Sagan seemed to come from the point of view that the universe was a place of infinite wonder, where one could look anywhere and be awed and humbled, Tyson's attitude is more of the universe as an infinite theme park - a place where you could see your electrons stripped from your body, watch gas clouds larger than our own solar system collide and ignite, or see planets crumple under cosmic bombardment. Tyson's universe is an adventure, as big as it gets.This book is a collection of essays that Tyson wrote for Natural History magazine over a ten year period, on a variety of subjects related to science and scientific inquiry. In many ways, it's similar to every other pop science book out there - and there are so very many of them - but it is his perspective and his voice that makes this one stand out from the crowd.He's grouped his essays into seven sections, on topics ranging from the difficulties inherent in actually knowing anything about the universe to the understanding of how life went from little mindless bacteria to we clever Homo sapiens to the intersection of science and religion. Most of it is accessible to the average non-scientist, though he does get a little technical at points. But he understands that, and he tries to compensate for for the fact that, by and large, the public is intimidated by ""real science."" In the essay entitled, ""Over the Rainbow,"" he discusses this particular challenge by using spectroscopy as an example.In spectroscopy, astrophysicists look at the spectrum of a star, hunting for telltale dark lines that indicate the physical properties of stars. It's like looking at a rainbow with bits blackened out of it, as though the CIA had somehow gotten to it first. Those black lines contain all the vital information about the star's composition and, more importantly, speed. Very little can be gleaned by just looking at the star, as it turns out. He notes five levels of abstraction, starting from the star itself:Level 0: A starLevel 1: Picture of a starLevel 2: Light from the picture of a starLevel 3: Spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.Level 4: Patterns of lines lacing the spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.Level 5: Shifts in the patterns of lines in the spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.These descending levels of abstraction can apply to any branch of science, not just astrophysics. The challenge, as he notes, is getting people past level 1, which is easy to understand but is not the level at which true science is done. It is up to educators, he says, to help make people comfortable with looking at real science, and not just pretty pictures.Indeed, there are several sections of the book dedicated to the intersection between science and the public. He talks about how easily we are baffled by numbers (why are below-ground floors not labeled -1, -2, -3 etc?) and how casually we disregard actual scientific facts. He brings up some of his favorite moments in bad movie science, and how he single-handedly saved Titanic from ignominious astronomical shame. At least, on its DVD re-release. He addresses the historically shifting centers of science in human history, how things like NASA are truly a global endeavor. Without the discoveries made through history by people all over the planet - from England to Greece to Baghdad - there would be no NASA, nor any science that we recognize. And to assume that the United States will always be the center of scientific discovery is to willfully ignore history.And, of course, there's a section dedicated to the conflict between religion and science, a never-ending battle that has existed since science began. Tyson believes that there can be no common ground between the two - science relies on facts, religion relies on faith. This is not to say that one is better than the other, any more than, say, a hammer is better than a screwdriver. It's just that you can't use them interchangeably. And he points out that becoming a scientist doesn't require you to give up your faith. There have been, and still are, countless scientists who are believers in the Divine. It's just that most of them know enough not to confuse science and spirituality. The place where they meet, historically, is on the boundary of ignorance. Isaac Newton, having figured out gravity, couldn't quite work out how you could have a multiple-body system like our solar system without the whole thing falling into chaos. His conclusion - God must, from time to time, step in to keep things on the right path. Having done that, Newton went on to do other things, and it wasn't until the next century that Pierre-Simon laPlace decided that he wasn't satisfied with Newton's ""Insert God Here"" argument, and did the math for himself.In other words, God is a marker on the boundaries of ignorance, and the best of us are tempted to let Him answer the questions that we can't. To do so, however, impedes the path of science and stops progress in its tracks. What if Newton had said, ""No, I'm going to figure this damn thing out."" Would we be a century ahead in our technology by now? Maybe, maybe not. What if the Catholic Church had listened when Galileo said, ""The Bible tells you how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."" Might more progress have been made? So many great thinkers have come up to the boundaries of their knowledge and, humbled by what they do not know, chose to allow The God of the Gaps reassure them.But that's the whole point of science, and it's what this book, and others like it, are trying to instill in people. The unknown is not horrible, it is not terrifying, and it's not a place to just stop. It's a place of awe and wonder and bafflement and opportunity. To say, ""I don't understand it - it must be God"" is short-changing ourselves and our heirs out of even greater knowledge of the universe."
4,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392197-jocelyn,5,"I don't think I can properly explain how much I love this book, but I'll try.Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries is a collection of essays Tyson wrote for Natural History, a magazine dedicated to -- you guessed it -- natural history (basically, science) between 1995-2005.What I like about it:- Tyson writes in a way that's easily accessible for anyone even without a science background. His analogies are easy to understand and they're fun. Like, ""Oh, Neil deGrasse Tyson, you."" Also, he tries to explain complex terms or theories so that you can finish the book and be a pseudo-astrophysicist. Now you can go to dinner parties and impress people with your knowledge about quarks and black holes and radio waves.- Tyson's writing is jovial and light-hearted. He frequently cracks jokes to lighten the mood -- you don't want to be bored. (Of course, I am a huge physics nerd and he could drone on and on about string theory and it could never bore me.) At one point, he jokes about red shirts. Red shirts, people! This guy's a winner.- Tyson takes the time to highlight two ways science (broadly) and astro-/physics (specifically) relate to both theology and culture. The Science and Culture section of the book was interesting, because what he describes is true: there is a misunderstanding between what scientists are doing and what the public thinks the scientists are doing. His little asides (rants) are fun, too.- This was a very informative book for just being a collection of 5-10 page essays. If you're new to astrophysics, the universe and particles, this stuff is like gold -- I don't think I've seen/heard any of the phenomena explained in a clearer way. If you're not new to any of this, then you probably shouldn't be reading this because you've probably already read it. Unless you really like it.Issues for some people, but weren't issues for me:- I understand that some people may go, ""Ugh, why does everything that has to do with science bring up religion and God!"" Tyson does dedicate a whole section of the book to (omg) 3 essays dealing with religion's place in science. He does so tactfully and tastefully. I'm not a religious person, but I don't think he would have offended anyone. And besides, religion and science have been at each others' throats since the dawn of both. If a popular astrophysicist didn't bring it up, someone would have asked why he didn't bring it up.- There's some repetition going on because, if you've read the preface and my review you'll know, this is a collection of essays from a magazine. There's bound to be some repetition because non-sciencey readers need to be reminded that Planck is considered the father of quantum mechanics and that Einstein's theory of relativity is a furthering of Newton's theory of gravity. Honestly, the repetition isn't enough where you would roll your eyes and mutter, ""Redundant.""- Some people may not be okay with Tyson's little rants. In one part he complains about the scientific ignorance going on in Hollywood skylines. Some readers may just want him to stop complaining and shut up already, but he has a right to his discontent. When you're a professional in your field, things that are obviously wrong annoy you more than those that don't belong to your field. You should see how irritated my family gets when I point out the inconsistencies movies have in regards to language and sociolinguistic situations. His annoyance is justified.Basically, what this all boils down to is this:How can you not like a man who dresses in a waistcoat with suns and stars on it?How can you not like a man whose reaction to Newton became a meme?Seriously, though, this book is awesome."
5,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309472-maria,3,"I have one last section to go (Religion and Science), but my main points won't be affected by it.Death By Black Hole provides, especially in the first couple of sections, a really good outline of various problems that astrophysicists are confronted with, and it definitely made me think of the scientific process in a new way. So that was pretty cool. But on the whole, my reaction was rather meh - kind of disappointing when the book really isn't bad. My main complaint about the book isn't actually the book's fault. It's just way below my level, and I found myself frequently bored. I think the best audience for the book is someone who's never had an astronomy class, and is maybe familiar with basic physics and chemistry. I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I read it in high school. I did learn a handful of new things, and sometimes Tyson's explanations helped some points I was fuzzy on click into place, but on the whole, I would have preferred the book to be much more detailed.My second problem is that, as Tyson says in the preface, the book is composed of various essays that he wrote for a magazine over the years, and that they were only slightly edited for continuity when he was preparing the book. Big mistake. While this divided the book into bite-sized, easy to process pieces, it also made it a helluva lot repetitive. Several phenomena were explained two, or even three times throughout the book. It should really have been edited a lot more aggressively.But on the whole, I think this is a really good pick for a layperson who doesn't know much about astronomy and isn't interested in involved explanations of the physical and chemical side of things. Neil deGrasse Tyson is one eloquent guy, and writes with an infectious passion for his subject. "
6,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"As a scientist, at first I was rather bored by this book. I was not learning anything new, and not gaining new insights into astronomy.But, as I read further, it just hit me--this book is tremendously entertaining! If you are a layman, and looking for a unique viewpoint, you could do a lot worse than this book. And, believe it or not, you will be entertained!In addition, Tyson puts several aspects of astronomy and astrophysics into a unique perspective. He describes all the ways that the universe is trying to kill us--storms, viruses, meteors, comets, climate change, volcanoes, and so on. But many of these lethal phenomena could be responsible for life existing on Earth, in the first place!I really did appreciate the arguments put forward against the idea of ""Intelligent Design."" Just because some areas in cosmology are not understood, does not mean that one is required to invoke God as a cause. Science always works on the frontier of knowledge, and if we were always to state that God is responsible for things we do not yet understand, then we would be working on the frontier of ignorance. Tyson does a much better job than I can, in explaining this concept. Highly recommended!"
7,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,4,"Neil is without doubt one of the greatest scientific communicators alive. He is erudite and hilarious with no apparent effort and can always bring the 'wow'.I enjoy his podcast and have probably watched near all videos on youtube that feature him. This is the first time that I have tried his written work and I am very pleased with the results.This work is a collection of editorial pieces that Neil writes for a periodical. They are intended to be short, punchy scientific stories and not form an ongoing dialogue.In this respect Neil did a brilliant job. I dipped in and out of this book over the last couple of weeks and it was simple to pick up again after each break. I read it while doing experiments in the lab, and I read it while on the toilet.What let the collection down (just the tiniest smidgen) was that some material was covered twice. Fine for an ongoing column and understandable for a collection, but still, a little work could have been taken to cull and back reference sections.Don't get me wrong, I adored this book. And anyone who has not discovered love for Neil needs to read it immediately. You'll definitely connect with him if you are sceptical, scientific or just a spotter of bullshit.This book left me wanting more. I want some long form stories, woven into a larger narrative. I have 'The Pluto Files' on my shelf. Maybe it won't be long before I open it."
8,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085121-stephanie-extremely-stable-genius,3,"Blinded by scienceEinstein, Io, comet tails Information glutI consider myself an intelligent person. I also find science fascinating. I'm just not sure what happen between me and Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries.....Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for a science-y book. Maybe I over estimated my intelligence. Both are quite possible. The whole time I was listening to this, it was like listening to Charlie Browns teacher. whaa wha whaa wha whaa Galileo, wha wha E=mc2, whaa whaa whaa Gravity sucks.I would get some really good, crunchy tidbit and be riveted.....and then the mind would drift to something like ""I wonder if I fed the cats, and CRAP I forgot to start the dishwasher""........then I would drift back to the science stuff.It just didn't hold my attention."
9,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37690097-ahmed-r-rashwan,4,"So I have a thing for Black Holes, so what?! You knew that already! You didn't? Well now you do.I have had an obsession with Black Holes for as long as I can remember. It was perhaps one of the first phenomena of the big umbrella of Astronomy and Cosmology that I was introduced to and I immediately fell in love with; I mean what is there not to love. An equal or even grander obsession is awarded of course to the author of this brilliant book.Of course, as with almost all scientific books, the title is pretty elusive. Yes, there was talk of Black Holes, a lot of talk, but there was a slew of other cosmological subjects too! But, of course, you will hear absolutely no complaints from me. As my favourite astronomer, I am inspired by Neil deGrasse Tyson much in the same way he was probably inspired by Carl Sagan.There is probably no other human beings on this planet that have invested more to the field of astronomy like Sagan and Tyson have. I, of course, do not mean this in a scientific sense but a commercial one. Sagan and Tyson are to Astronomy what Bill Nye is to Science.So for all intends and purposes, this review is in fact a form of praising for Neil deGrasse Tyson and his meaning to me as a person rather than a review of the actual book. There are simply some people out there who's literary work is completely overshadowed by their contributions to the subject upon which they write about, so I will dismiss the small quantity of repetitiveness inherent in all scientific books (especially ones comprising of several essays).They tell you never to meet your heroes, that it is somehow inevitable to be disappointed by such an interaction; that the perfect image you have most definitely built of your heroes is most certainly to fall short of reality. But while I cannot claim to have met Neil deGrasse Tyson, I have at least had a closer glimpse to his personal opinions and thoughts. I shied away from this book for the longest time specifically for fear of being disappointed by the literary work of a person I probably hold the highest esteem of amongst all people.I don't even recall when or how I was first ""introduced"" to Neil but what followed was an obsession that has lasted years, till this day. I have probably watched his 'Cosmos' show, inspired by Carl Sagan's Cosmos up to at least 5 times. Neil is funny, witty, intelligent and very very charismatic. If it wasn't for him, there would have definitely been so many different aspects of astronomy that I wouldn't have particularly grabbed. His style of ""story-telling"" transports you back to a time when anything interested you, when your explorer genes were yet to be suppressed; just like you were a little kid again. So it comes as no surprise that I read the entire book imagining Neil was narrating it to me, for I had completely memorised his pattern of speech and voice, and it is equally not surprising that I would love any work, literary or otherwise that Neil produces.I ask nothing more of men of science, to be able to pass down the passion in the way that Neil has been very successful in doing is the calling for all of scientists, regardless of their field of study."
10,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96756984-yesenia-juarez,5,"This book was much harder than Astrophysics for people in a hurry! I’m glad I have the paperback edition as well because I most definitely will be re-reading this! However, still wonderful and I always enjoy Neil Degrasse Tyson’s sense of humor even though most of the puns went over my head. "
11,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1306562-josh,1,"For me this book was merely okay. I've read quite a bit of these types of books, physics for the layperson, and this book was probably my least favorite.I don't like the overall tone of the book. Tyson makes a point to belittle the human race as much as possible and he comes across as pessimistic. By no means do I think humans are the pinnacle of perfection, but I think we're doing pretty well.The content of the book was all over the place and only briefly touched on black holes and other cosmic quandaries. In fact the titular cosmological event, though an ""entire"" chapter, was hardly described while long tangents about minor events in historical figures' lives were expounded in detail.I don't recommend this book to any but those that are cursorily interested in cosmology. I recommend Hawking, Brian Greene or Amir Aczel."
12,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14386596-christopher,4,"There isn't anything particularly advanced in this book, though as it is a collection of essays, perhaps that is expected. It's easy to get into as a result, and Tyson has a good style that stays entertaining while being informative. "
13,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1536431-leslie,4,"If the lovely fact that our sun will probably burn out in 4 billion years and our beloved Earth will turn into a huge ball of black rock because of it (until it's vaporized that is) bothers you, keeps you up in the night, this book might not be for you. If you're worried about an asteroid hitting somewhere between Hawaii and California in 2039 and Idaho becoming ocean front property (hmm, maybe an improvement?), then this book might not be for you. If you're worried about what might happen to you if you inadvertently get a little, tinsy bit too close to a black hole of death! (even your atoms get pulled apart) then again, I might not read this book. Because, if you thought your ulcer was healing and you could eat salsa with your chips again. Think again! A collection of essays about a myriad of cosmic topics from Natural History magazine written by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson (you've probably seen him on PBS, and no he's not the night sky guy with the weird voice), this book entertains. Frightens. Enlightens. And inevitably makes you feel much, much smarter for reading it. But believe me, sometimes this knowledge is a scary, scary thing! In fact, now I'd like to take some of it back. Oh, brain atrophy!Except for a few about half way through that made my eyes start to glaze over, I found most of these essays really interesting and readable. Tyson is obviously one of those well known science professionals who is actually interested in, and good at, teaching (believe it or not!) instead of just doing research and publishing. So yes, they do exist..Way, oh way back in the dark ages when I was in college I took a series of physics classes from an astronaut named Don Lind. He was a cocky ass who said stuff like, if you ever get a chance to fly in space.. . I wanted to slap him...anyway, I remember learning about prisms and color and how our brain interprets it, and thinking that was the coolest thing! I remember telling my twelve year old sister about it, about how a prism works and why we are able to see that myriad of colors without moving our eyes (look it up, it's really cool!).

According to her numbers, that leaves 0.0000004 planets with intelligent life on them, which is a figure somewhat lower than “millions.” No doubt that “one in a million” sounds better on screen than “one in ten,” but you can’t fake math. The book did have it's flaws, some repetitions and some dull moments , but just a few.If you like the subject….. read this book. "

Neil goes over some really interesting concepts, but they aren't what I would say for advanced readers. Much like his work on Cosmos, the concepts are simple but entertaining and informative. This is a book you could give to beginners who are just dipping their toes into astronomy, physics and earth space sciences. Like always, it's written in a warmer tone than say, Dawkins or Hitchens, and is even more accessible than Hawking although his works are written for the every day person as well. I wouldn't say this is for kids, but kids who are ""advanced"" in reading and sciences would get a kick out of this. I'd love to meet this guy one day. Him, Bill Nye, Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking sparked my love of science in my high school years, and it became an obsession in my adulthood. Thanks, guys. "

to deny or erase the rich, colorful history of scientists and other thinkers who have invoked divinity in their work would be intellectually dishonest. surely there's an appropriate place for intelligent design to live in the academic landscape. how about the history of religion? how about philosophy or psychology? the one place it doesn't belong is the science classroom.if you're not swayed by academic arguments, consider the financial consequences. allow intelligent design into science textbooks, lecture halls, and laboratories, and the cost to the frontier of scientific discovery - the frontier that drives the economies of the future - would be incalculable. i don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed and therefore beyond their intellectual capacity. the day that happens, americans will just sit in awe of what we don't understand, while we watch the rest of the world boldly go where no mortal has gone before.

19,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879178-kathy,3,"A great title for a book, that alone made me want to read it. Of course, this is the type of book I will almost always pick up from the library. It is a collection of essays on science for the magazine Natural History. It covers a wide range of topics, usually relating to physics, from particle physics to astrophysics. I love this stuff and I only wish I retained enough math to be able to read more technical discussions than these rather general essays.The essays are informative and entertaining. A lot has changed in the 17 years since I took my particle physics class at BYU, so I am always interested to learn more. Not only does he describe what is happening in science, he describes the edges very well. By edges I mean the places where scientists are not sure what is happening and are actively searching for answers. That is always the most interesting part of any science. The problem today is that to get to that edge, you have to take years of schooling to understand what they are looking for. Once the edge could be explored in your home lab or a field (if you were Benjamin Franklin) now you need millions of dollars and a space telescope.The book is a bit repetitive, though that often happens with collections of essays because each one had to be self contained and couldn't refer to last month's issue. There has been a bit of editing to smooth out the sequencing and to make it an easier read.While I enjoyed all the essays, I took exception to the last one, entitled, The Perimeter of Ignorance. Here is the author's basic premise, Writing in centuries past, many scientists felt compelled to wax poetic about cosmic mysteries and God's handiwork. Perhaps one should not be surprised at this: most scientists back then, as well as many scientists today, identify themselves as spiritually devout. But a careful reading of older texts, particularly those concerned with the universe itself, shows that the authors invoke divinity only when they reach the boundaries of their understanding. They appeal to a higher power only when staring at the ocean of their own ignorance. They call on God only from the lonely and precarious edge of incomprehension. Where they feel certain about their explanations, however, God hardly gets a mention.He goes on from this hypothesis to give some quotes from Newton and other scientists, who do indeed see an explanation for the unexplainable in the presence of God. He then links this tendency to the current vogue for intelligent design. That also follows, more or less. I have my own issues with intelligent design, at least how it is being explained and used in the public sphere, but I won't go into all that here. The problem I have is that the author considers an appeal to deity as an admission of failure and the mental equivalent of throwing up your hands and saying, ""Heck if I know, only God could figure that out, I will just go find something easier to study, like Paris Hilton."" He says, in talking about intelligent design and the dangers of it, I don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed and therefore beyond their intellectual capacity.Since when is saying something is divinely designed the same as saying we are not capable of understanding it? As a devout person, but one who would have been a scientist, if not for a few chance decisions and a problem with basic arithmetic, I find everything divinely inspired, even those things we do understand. Too many people equate religion with ignorance, without considering the fact that the intelligent people who believe, must have a valid reason for doing so. And similarly, there are many ignorant people who have no religion. I cringe whenever a particularly proud, ignorant and Christian person is on the news saying something stupid because that just reinforces this ignorance=religion stereotype. I'm here to say intelligence=true religion. Believing in ignorance is just superstition whatever belief it may be. The more you understand your own beliefs, the more you want to learn. Our brains are designed to increase in knowledge, anything that does that helps all of us, no matter what the information may be."
20,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,3,"DEATH BY BLACK HOLE AND OTHER COSMIC QUANDARIES BY NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: An astrophysicist for the American Museum of Natural History, director of the world famous Hayden Planetarium, and columnist for Natural History magazine, Neil DeGrasse Tyson brings to the non-scientific world the ideal book for those fascinated with space, the cosmos, black holes, and all the questions and wonders therein. Death by Black Hole is the perfect book for the reader who wants answers to questions about the universe in a simple and clearly defined way so that even if they know next to nothing about science and it’s jargon, Tyson makes it easily understandable.While I was hoping for something a little more in depth in the style of Brian Greene’s The Fabric of the Cosmos or Lee Smolin’s The Trouble With Physics, Death by Black Hole nevertheless provides quick and simple answers to many questions everyday readers without a science background have about physics, the universe, space, and most matters dealing with the cosmos. The book is a selection of his columns in Natural History that are organized in a somewhat textbook fashion. Tyson starts with the idea of science and nature in its basic form, how humanity views Earth, the solar system, the universe. Along with this discussion, Tyson also gives minor history lessons on the development of different ideas in physics and astronomy, what people came up with what big ideas and how the progression led to the development of the big theories of our current time with string theory and relativity. Going on from here, Death by Black Hole address the crucial steps that led to the formation of the universe and its development over the many billions and billions of years, again explaining how it is that scientists know what they do and what instruments were used, as well as the history of who invented and used said instruments.It is then that Tyson finally turns to the subject matter of the title of the book in the section “When the Universe Turns Bad: All the Ways the Cosmos Wants to Kill Us.” Here he addresses the complex and still relatively unknown subjects of chaos theory, dark matter (which constitutes over 90% of all matter in the universe, while we still know next to nothing about it), and finally black holes. Tyson takes the reader on a hypothetical journey with what would happen if one were to be sucked into a black hole and how as they approached the event horizon, they would become stretched until the elasticity point of their skin was surpassed and the body would be torn into thousands then millions of little pieces.With many questions now answered, in the next section Tyson discusses how science is viewed by the media, Hollywood, and people around the world in general. The final section addresses the concept of science and religion, again taking the reader on a historic journey through the development of first religion, then science, and the struggle that has ensued for centuries. It is the perfect end to a book on science, as Tyson lectures the importance of supporting fact and reality in a time when there are many who believe more in faith, even when all the evidence is to the contrary.For more book reviews, and author interviews, go to BookBanter."
21,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558652-emma-sea,3,"My main dissatisfaction with this book is that it's a series of collected magazine columns. This does seem a bit like criticising an apple because it's not a banana, however I think Tyson would have be been better advised to hire an editor to whip this into an actual book, rather than just reprint the original short essays. For example, in chapter 25 Tyson critiques the concept of the ""Goldilocks Zone"", discussing the myriad ways life could flourish in environments entirely dissimilar to our own e.g. in seas of liquid ammonia or methane. But then in the following chapter Tyson contends that life will only originate on a planet with a temperature that allows liquid water i.e. in the Goldilocks Zone. Originally these essays would have been published months or years apart, but juxtaposed like this it is a frustrating read, to say the least.The other problem with short essays is that things just start to get interesting and it's over. In chapter 21 Tyson briefly mentions technetium; an element with a half-life of only 2 million years, but which is nevertheless found in red giant stars. ""In other words, the star cannot have been born with the stuff, for if it were there would be none left by now. There is also no known mechanism to create technetium in a star's core and have it dredge itself up to the surface where it is observed, which has led to exotic theories that have yet to achieve consensus in the astrophysics community""But you know, those diverse and exotic theories are exactly what I'd like to hear about! That was the most interesting part of the book for me, and it just gets left lying gasping on the floor.Also, sadly, the book is aimed at someone who has done little or no prior science reading; a far broader generalist audience that I hoped for. I 100% agree with Maria's review, when she says this would be a good high-school-level book. If you don't generally read pop-science, but would like to learn more about how our universe works, I definitely recommend this book. Tyson is a great writer: engaging and able to explain complex ideas simply, with a dash of humour.For me it's a 2.5, rounded up."
22,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2593734-nicholas-armstrong,2,"I can already see the masses of Tyson fans charging ahead just to light me aflame for having the audicity to doubt a word he says, but so I must. To be fair, I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. I saw him speak at USC, I've watched his lectures and his interviews, and I think he has done more for popularizing science than anyone else. But none of that a writer makes. This is especially true of sarcastic and sardonic wit. Being funny in text is what I would rate as the most challenging things to accomplish (some comics may agree) because it loses so much of the presence, tone, and body language that makes something funny. Tyson is a legitimately funny person, I promise this, but aside from the knowledge that he wrote this, none of that translates well. I could guess that this is because much of his humor is in his intonations, pauses, and timing, something any classclown can tell you about. But not any classclown can write a best-selling comedic novel, nor can just any astro-physicist write a truly comic novel, or at least one which transfers that genius.What I'm getting at is that this book is dry. It seeks to inform, but it does so in a way that is just a little bit uninteresting and just a little bit reminscent of my astronomy courses. Interesting stuff, but the delivery was just all wrong.This wasn't assisted by the fact that the structuring of the book is terrible. To be fair, Tyson admits at the outset that this is little more than a collection of essays slapped back to back and tidied up a bit to try and make them fit, but that is exactly how they read. The transitions are generally poor and always jarring. The sentences don't blend together so much as float like an oily film, and trying to read too many consectutive pieces put together makes me feel as if my brain were a poorly done game of tetris - too many holes and not enough matching lines.But hey, I'm for anything that gets people reading, and I'm especially for anything that gets people reading about the world and about science. It goes without saying that I'm far happier this book is out there and so widely read than never having been published. I just prattle on because I'm a snot-nose with too many standards."
23,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5495893-leana-m,5,Well written and great stuff for the universe geek (or anyone with the slightest interest and curiosity for learning). NDT adds some fun with his quirks and humor. Allow me to indulge in a little pun here- And it ends with a bang. ;) 
24,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6071693-dale-jr,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson has become a bit of an inspiration and scientific hero to me. He's a man who strongly pushes forth to erase scientific ignorance and champions the exploration of our world and the universe to further human greatness.His lectures are intensely interesting and full of scientific knowledge, yet easy to follow by anyone willing to listen and apply their minds. He boils down some of the most complex theories and scientific facts so that they're easily understood. His writing is no different.I've been diving further and further into astrophysics and varying theories in related fields (string and multiverse theory is, simply put, awesome). This journey has made me quite familiar with Tyson and I figured it was about time to pick up one of his texts.Death by Black Hole is a collection of essays and lectures spanning the entire field of astrophysics and cosmology. From the Big Bang, to the life cycles of stars. From the speed of light to the mind-boggling power of black holes. There's even a section where Tyson describes the three biggest ways our world will come to an end. And it has nothing to do with ancient Mayan prophecy or the second coming.When scientifically investigating the natural world the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier.Since it is a collection of various lectures and essays, some information is repeated here and there, but it does not detract from the wealth of knowledge contained between the covers. I learned a lot. Retained most of it in one reading due to Tyson's way of writing and explaining. This is a book full of information, yet you never feel like your reading something as dry as a text book. Tyson makes you want to keep reading. He injects humor along with serious scientific education.I'm glad that his book lived up to my expectations of him and I will be sure to pick up his others. Quite frankly, this was the best non-fiction book I've read this year. Wonderfully executed and easily devoured. I feel both filled with new knowledge, and humbled by the amount I, and the rest of my human brothers and sisters, do not know yet.But as Tyson lays out in his book, it's not wrong to be ignorant of something as long as you are continuing to try and figure it out.Science is a philosophy of discovery. Intelligent design is a philosophy of ignorance. You cannot build a program of discovery on the assumption that nobody is smart enough to figure out the answer to the problem. Once upon a time, people identified the god Neptune as the source of storms at sea. Today we call these storms hurricanes. We know when and where they start. We know what drives them. We know what mitigates their destructive power. And anyone who has studied global warming can tell you what makes them worse. The only people who still call hurricanes ""acts of God"" are the people who write insurance forms."
25,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96664-samantha,4,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. His humor and straightforwardness were some of the best things about the History Channel documentary, The Universe. And his lectures on YouTube are always extremely inventive, interesting, and entertaining. So when I saw this book on the shelf at my local bookstore, I had to buy it.I wasn't disappointed.Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed learning about the universe. I'll never be an astrophysicist, but it always fascinates me to learn about all that's out there (and all that may be out there that we have yet to discover). Of course, the language of the cosmos is complicated: nebulae, pulsars, quasars, supernovas, black holes, event horizons, dark matter, antimatter, etc., etc.That's where Dr. Tyson comes in. He has an uncanny ability to take something that is unfailingly complex to the 'average' person such as myself and explain it in a way that I can understand. And he does so with unsurpassed humor, wit, and even the slightest bit of self-deprecation.In the end, he says, the universe is out to kill us. In many, many ways. And even though there is a lot we still don't understand about the universe and how it began and where it's going, that doesn't mean we stop looking. There is always more to learn, there is always more to discover, and if the essays in his book are any indication, it is all utterly fascinating.The last part of the book deals with science and religion. Dr. Tyson claims that being a scientist doesn't necessarily preclude belief in God. However, he staunchly claims that God has no business in scientific discovery, that simply crediting God with creating all the things that science can't currently explain opens the door to the cessation of scientific discovery. He quotes Galileo, who said, ""I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.""If the science vs. God debate makes you uncomfortable, have no fear--it's a very small part of the book, tucked in at the very end after all the terrific science essays.I highly recommend this book, even if you're only slightly interested in the universe.

26,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2751053-bakari,5,"Astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson‘s Death By Black Hole is definitely an engaging read, especially for these modern times. Though many pages and chapters about the particulars of matter, energy, space, and time—the physics of the universe—were very difficult for my scientifically illiterate mind to comprehend, I read nearly ever page for nuggets of understanding. Tyson is a excellent writer because he knows his subject matter. Just think how different our Bible reading population would be if Tyson had wrote the Book of Genesis. His “in the beginning“ would have probably talked about the discoveries and meaning of supernovas, as the “primary source for the origin and relative mix of heavy elements in the universe.” He would have verses about Newton’s laws of motion and early twentieth century theories about quantum mechanics. His creation story would not be described in a mere seven days; his story would talk about billions of years—more time than most of us can imagine. But of course, the Bible was written in an era which lacked the scientific discoveries that Tyson writes about. But, but...this is what makes Death By Black Hole, and other books similar to it, so important. Reading a book like this provides us more knowledge about the universe and who we are as homo sapiens than Biblical writers could ever imagine. We simply need the education, patience, and study to learn what has been discovered. Though we are not, as Tyson writes in his essay, “Fear of Numbers,” “wired for logical thinking,” the brain, as he goes on to say, is “a marvelously flexible organ.” And in my view it’s time that more and more of us start using our brain to its greatest potential. Believing and praying to gods and reading horoscopes are no longer sufficient for our survival as a species. We can do much, much better than that.Perhaps a few months from now, I’ll read another of Tyson‘s books, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution, and view the PBS companion special as I do. It will be much like viewing the Carl Sagan’s Cosmos back in my college days. "
27,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4826452-evan-wondrasek,5,"Death by Black Hole is one of the most interesting non-fiction science books I've ever read. It's a collection of essays published by Neil deGrasse Tyson over the last 10+ years, and provides great, down-to-earth explanations of amazing astrophysics phenomena. This isn't a book about farfetched scenarios as its title implies - only a single chapter was actually about ""death by black hole"" - but the rest of the book presented a thorough and highly scientific explanation of the universe as we know it.Being that this book wasn't written as one cohesive text (it's a summary of essays as I mentioned), there is some informational overlap between the chapters. You'll be introduced to people like Galileo, Keppler, and Huygens more than once. I didn't mind at all, and I thought the overlap helped me solidify information.My favorite part of this book the crazy facts about celestial scale it presented. For example, the book states that a photon of light takes something like 500 seconds to go from the Sun's surface to the surface of earth; conversely, that same photon took upwards of 100,000 years to go from the Sun's core to the Sun's surface. Read the book and you'll learn why :)"
28,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3110398-sean,4,"I feel that the reason that people do not understand science in the US today is because we have a foolish tradition of thinking that the only way to ""know"" physics is through the terse formalism of mathematics. Math is a tool to do science, as much as a microscope or a superconducting supercollider. The disservice we do as scientists are when we are unable to communicate the concepts about our physical world to the population at large because we tangle ourselves up in mathematical formalism.Neil DeGrasse Tyson will never have that criticism hurled against him.It is in the tradition of Sagan, Gribbin and Hawking that Tyson writes and his essays are pure delight, discussing the concepts of physics as though he was having a casual coffee talk. It makes science fun. Yes your brain will come alive, but for a basic understanding of our physical world, this book should be read and I can't wait to read another by him.I even learned that laser spectroscopists and chemists label the same energy transitions differently. Awesome."

It's funny and engaging in a way you couldn't imagine a book about astrophysics being (without reading this book). How did it all begin and where are we going are just some of the cosmic quandaries that are tackled. It even has a whole section on how many ways the planet and its life could end! Fun stuff for a nerd like me. Plus, it touches on many other science/culture conundrums that are great food for thought. It was a tiny redundant, owing to the fact that these are all previously written essays collected for purpose of the book. But, I actually liked the redundancy. It allowed more time for the heavy science behind astrophysics to sink in, and I became more familiar with the scientists that propelled our cosmic knowledge forward. Overall, it was a great read. It was a refreshing break from the day-to-day politics and tedium that can make our lives feel very small. From the advantage of science, it truly put our Earthly lives into a cosmic perspective."
30,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a force to reckon with. But he is not Carl Sagan. While Sagan must have smiled down kindly on your meek acknowledgement of ignorance regarding, say, black holes, Tyson will have most probably given you the stink eye or aimed a sarcastic jibe at your apathy, before proceeding to explain why black holes still remain a topic of much speculation in the community of astrophysicists worldwide.Tyson does not pull any punches in this collection of essays while slamming the news media, who more often than not, come off as ill-informed hacks doing a shoddy job of reporting facts in the field of space science, forever (stupidly) claiming how scientists are baffled by so-and-so new developments. 
""Scientists cannot claim to be on the research frontier unless one thing or another baffles them. Bafflement drives discovery.""
Or snidely commenting on the Hollywood exercise of producing multi-million dollar sci-fi films which badly butcher the scientific aspects of such ventures by inserting factually incorrect observations in scenes and dialogues. (there's a brilliant anecdote concerning James Cameron's 'Titanic' in this regard and the Contact film gets an honorable mention for its adherence to proper science if one overlooks a minor gaffe)
""I am glad that, in the end, the humans win. We conquer the 'Independence Day' aliens by having a Macintosh laptop computer upload a software virus to the mothership. [] The entire defense system for the alien mothership must have been powered by the same release of Apple Computer's system software as the laptop computer that delivered the virus.""
Or criticizing the mad dash for extending the frontiers of space science during the Cold war years, when the spirit of scientific inquiry was sidelined in favor of a dangerous game of political one-upmanship, a kind of puerile assertion of 'our scientists are better than yours'. Or openly chastising revered names from ancient Greece like Aristotle whose inaccurate assumptions about the unchanging nature of stars and the geocentric universe helped the Catholic Church in propagating falsities for centuries with impunity. (He doesn't even spare Newton for God's Higgs Boson's sake who, unable to satisfactorily explain the ordered behavior of the solar system despite the many often conflicting gravitational forces at work, had cited God's need to step in to correct things in his famed 'Principia')While Sagan may have adopted a more benign, less aggressive tone in course of addressing issues of religious dogma being at loggerheads with scientific reasoning and aversion to science and mathematics among the general populace, NDT takes the approach of pure, unadulterated logic and demolishes one popular misconception after another (for e.g.:-the North Star is not the most brilliant star in the night sky or how everything that goes up doesn't come down) with a brute force which I am certain will not sit well with some sensitive readers who are easily offended. Being born in a country whose space research organization head performs pujas and makes ritualistic offerings prior to launching a 'Mission to Mars', I can't say I fault NDT's acerbic tone or his distaste for those who are hell-bent on unifying science and religion without even realizing that finding common ground between both is akin to attempting to exceed the velocity of light. But if NDT lacks Sagan's sage-like demeanour and his rich, authorial voice (Sagan's prose is much more refined no doubt), his excellent sense of humor almost compensates for their absence - 
""The good thing about the laws of physics is that they require no law enforcement agencies to maintain them, although I once owned a nerdy T-shirt that loudly proclaimed, ""OBEY GRAVITY.""

""The only people who still call hurricanes 'acts of God' are the people who write insurance forms.""
(and Michele Bachmann, just saying)And occasionally there's a sop thrown in for the literary-minded (particularly the postmodernist fiction lover) - ""The physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who in 1964 proposed the existence of quarks, and who at the time thought the quark family had only three members, drew the name from a characteristically elusive line in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake: 'Three quarks for Muster Mark!'""
The more frivolous aspects of the essays aside, among the astrophysics-related topics NDT centers his discussions around, the ones which were relatively new to me are the concepts of hypernovae, gamma ray bursts, dark matter and dark energy, the uncertainty surrounding the string theory and the probability of the annihilation of Earth through ill-fated, cosmic encounters with errant asteroids, the unavoidable, impending collision of our galaxy with the Andromeda galaxy which is the nearest one heading towards us at a speed of more than 100 kilometers per second.The Andromeda GalaxySince this is a collection of 42 essays which were published in the 'Natural History' magazine, some repetition of concepts and names creeps in occasionally but that merely helps you refresh memories of what you just read a few pages back, not exactly a shortcoming I am keen to quibble over. 4 stars, because Tyson seems a little too bitter about artists who exercise 'artistic license' to distort certain astronomical facts in their paintings. Besides I am certain there is a lot of 5-star-worthy goodness in the rest of NDT's works left for me to discover in the future."

I really appreciated that. :)I'd characterize this book as an easy to intermediate stage science book that's very far from being dull and it has a minimum of equations. I'm sure everyone has heard of thermodynamics and E=MC squared and Drake's equation, after all, but what really thrilled me about this was the truly wide array of subjects and Tyson's conversational tone.You can tell he is still a very, very good science teacher. :)I can almost hear him say, ""Let's throw out the crap, folks, let's dive right into the good stuff."" And he does, ranging from the Big Bang to the Heat Death, kinds of possible life on planets, the building blocks we need to understand science, including a great ""stick"" analogy for understanding the universe without computers, and he even gets into a bit of politics and religion because let's face it: it's a hot discussion item. But thankfully, it's only there as an afterthought.I wanted science and I got science, exploring the planets, the sun, even quasars, and especially Black Holes. That's the yummy stuff, after all.  10/10 Black Holes agree! Nom nom nom nom nom. I totally recommend this for both laymen and the intelligently curious and for anyone else who just likes a bit of the good (science) life. It really, really helps that Tyson's a great writer and clear as glass. The light passes right through it without slowing down at all! Can you believe it?"
32,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70078-chloe,4,"Within my skull, where all of those vital pieces of data surrounding science are supposed to be stored, there is instead a vast beaker-shaped void of ignorance. In high school, while we were supposed to be studying the musculature of the formaldehyde-soaked amphibians pinned ignominiously to their coffinesque metal trays, I was far more interested in studying the effects of adding fire to small green buds. During my brief time wandering the hallways of the University world, I was able to do away with my prerequisite requirement by taking an “Arts of Science” course tailor-made for those more interested in empathy than entropy and, while I did manage to get a crocodile on my report card, all I took away from that class was an abiding hatred for hippies. The long and the short of all this is that I didn’t know a quasar from a neutron or a brown dwarf from a red giant (though Red Dwarf was a magnificent television series).As a devout lover of science fiction and hi-tech gadgetry of all sorts, this was a matter of not a little shame for me. To resolve this I decided that it was time for me to fill in some of the (immense) gaps in my education the best way I know how- via book. Yet how to avoid having my eyes glaze over the moment someone started explaining cell structures or complex wave fields? Fortunately, as it often does, my television provided a solution when Stephen Colbert took a visit to the American Museum of Natural Historys Hayden Planetarium and spoke with its Director, Neil deGrasse Tyson. Tyson, while just as geeky as you would expect from an astrophysicist, is phenomenally skilled at taking incredibly complex scientific theories and translating them into a Common English that even Stephen Colbert is able to understand. My fate was sealed. This man was the ideal author to ease myself into the brave new world of stellar science.Death by Black Hole is a collection of essays the Tyson penned for Natural History magazine over the course of several years. Each essay addresses a different topic, running the gamut from the birth of the universe, the history of astronomical discoveries, humankind’s fixation on the red hills of Mars and the life-bringing water that may lay frozen away, all the way to the Pluto Wars (it’s amazing just how contentious Pluto’s status as planet is). Of course there’s some overlap between the chapters and some facts get repeated but, rather than bugging me, I found it to be a good refresher of what had come before that helped solidify my basic understanding of the concepts at hand. Most interesting to me, policy junkie that I am, is the closing essay in which Tyson writes about the plague of scientific ignorance sweeping the country. After almost brutally doing away with that Bible-in-textbook-clothing anachronism that is “intelligent design,” he makes great points about America’s waning prestige in scientific research and the future costs, both economic and academic, that we will have to pay due to ceding our intellectual priority to advance knowledge. I’m not much interested in sustaining American supremacy in any field, but I can always get behind an argument for strengthening education.What I most enjoyed was the excitement that Tyson has for his field. He doesn’t get bogged down in the minutiae of atomic weights and the like, but thrills at the possibilities of quantum mechanics and takes an almost excessive amount of joy in ruminating over the possible ways that people can be killed in space from the atom-splitting nullification of crossing a black hole’s event horizon to the persistent fear of a species-leveling asteroid striking Earth. Tyson is a man possessed of a childlike sense of wonder at the mysteries of the universe that sees the current limits of our scientific understanding not as having reached the final frontiers of science but as hurdles to be vaulted over in our quest to know. His enthusiasm is quite contagious and I challenge any reader to emerge from this book without being excited about science."
33,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"I have often lamented the passing of my favorite popular scientist, Carl Sagan, by talking about how necessary he is right now. We are at a point in our history where scientific illiteracy is growing, where people are not only ignorant of how science works, but are proud of their ignorance. What we need is someone who can reach the majority of Americans who are not especially scientifically literate - the people whose automatic reaction to science is to think, ""That's just too hard for me to deal with.""Enter Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and the director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. He's appeared on countless television programs, including The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, to talk about the current state of astronomy and astrophysics. He's an engaging and entertaining man, who claims that Pluto was ""asking for"" its demotion, who seems to take perverse pleasure in describing all the terrible ways the universe could take us out. He knows that we're in a precarious position, here on Earth, and he revels in it rather than worrying about it. Whereas Sagan seemed to come from the point of view that the universe was a place of infinite wonder, where one could look anywhere and be awed and humbled, Tyson's attitude is more of the universe as an infinite theme park - a place where you could see your electrons stripped from your body, watch gas clouds larger than our own solar system collide and ignite, or see planets crumple under cosmic bombardment. Tyson's universe is an adventure, as big as it gets.This book is a collection of essays that Tyson wrote for Natural History magazine over a ten year period, on a variety of subjects related to science and scientific inquiry. In many ways, it's similar to every other pop science book out there - and there are so very many of them - but it is his perspective and his voice that makes this one stand out from the crowd.He's grouped his essays into seven sections, on topics ranging from the difficulties inherent in actually knowing anything about the universe to the understanding of how life went from little mindless bacteria to we clever Homo sapiens to the intersection of science and religion. Most of it is accessible to the average non-scientist, though he does get a little technical at points. But he understands that, and he tries to compensate for for the fact that, by and large, the public is intimidated by ""real science."" In the essay entitled, ""Over the Rainbow,"" he discusses this particular challenge by using spectroscopy as an example.In spectroscopy, astrophysicists look at the spectrum of a star, hunting for telltale dark lines that indicate the physical properties of stars. It's like looking at a rainbow with bits blackened out of it, as though the CIA had somehow gotten to it first. Those black lines contain all the vital information about the star's composition and, more importantly, speed. Very little can be gleaned by just looking at the star, as it turns out. He notes five levels of abstraction, starting from the star itself:Level 0: A starLevel 1: Picture of a starLevel 2: Light from the picture of a starLevel 3: Spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.Level 4: Patterns of lines lacing the spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.Level 5: Shifts in the patterns of lines in the spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.These descending levels of abstraction can apply to any branch of science, not just astrophysics. The challenge, as he notes, is getting people past level 1, which is easy to understand but is not the level at which true science is done. It is up to educators, he says, to help make people comfortable with looking at real science, and not just pretty pictures.Indeed, there are several sections of the book dedicated to the intersection between science and the public. He talks about how easily we are baffled by numbers (why are below-ground floors not labeled -1, -2, -3 etc?) and how casually we disregard actual scientific facts. He brings up some of his favorite moments in bad movie science, and how he single-handedly saved Titanic from ignominious astronomical shame. At least, on its DVD re-release. He addresses the historically shifting centers of science in human history, how things like NASA are truly a global endeavor. Without the discoveries made through history by people all over the planet - from England to Greece to Baghdad - there would be no NASA, nor any science that we recognize. And to assume that the United States will always be the center of scientific discovery is to willfully ignore history.And, of course, there's a section dedicated to the conflict between religion and science, a never-ending battle that has existed since science began. Tyson believes that there can be no common ground between the two - science relies on facts, religion relies on faith. This is not to say that one is better than the other, any more than, say, a hammer is better than a screwdriver. It's just that you can't use them interchangeably. And he points out that becoming a scientist doesn't require you to give up your faith. There have been, and still are, countless scientists who are believers in the Divine. It's just that most of them know enough not to confuse science and spirituality. The place where they meet, historically, is on the boundary of ignorance. Isaac Newton, having figured out gravity, couldn't quite work out how you could have a multiple-body system like our solar system without the whole thing falling into chaos. His conclusion - God must, from time to time, step in to keep things on the right path. Having done that, Newton went on to do other things, and it wasn't until the next century that Pierre-Simon laPlace decided that he wasn't satisfied with Newton's ""Insert God Here"" argument, and did the math for himself.In other words, God is a marker on the boundaries of ignorance, and the best of us are tempted to let Him answer the questions that we can't. To do so, however, impedes the path of science and stops progress in its tracks. What if Newton had said, ""No, I'm going to figure this damn thing out."" Would we be a century ahead in our technology by now? Maybe, maybe not. What if the Catholic Church had listened when Galileo said, ""The Bible tells you how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."" Might more progress have been made? So many great thinkers have come up to the boundaries of their knowledge and, humbled by what they do not know, chose to allow The God of the Gaps reassure them.But that's the whole point of science, and it's what this book, and others like it, are trying to instill in people. The unknown is not horrible, it is not terrifying, and it's not a place to just stop. It's a place of awe and wonder and bafflement and opportunity. To say, ""I don't understand it - it must be God"" is short-changing ourselves and our heirs out of even greater knowledge of the universe."
34,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392197-jocelyn,5,"I don't think I can properly explain how much I love this book, but I'll try.Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries is a collection of essays Tyson wrote for Natural History, a magazine dedicated to -- you guessed it -- natural history (basically, science) between 1995-2005.What I like about it:- Tyson writes in a way that's easily accessible for anyone even without a science background. His analogies are easy to understand and they're fun. Like, ""Oh, Neil deGrasse Tyson, you."" Also, he tries to explain complex terms or theories so that you can finish the book and be a pseudo-astrophysicist. Now you can go to dinner parties and impress people with your knowledge about quarks and black holes and radio waves.- Tyson's writing is jovial and light-hearted. He frequently cracks jokes to lighten the mood -- you don't want to be bored. (Of course, I am a huge physics nerd and he could drone on and on about string theory and it could never bore me.) At one point, he jokes about red shirts. Red shirts, people! This guy's a winner.- Tyson takes the time to highlight two ways science (broadly) and astro-/physics (specifically) relate to both theology and culture. The Science and Culture section of the book was interesting, because what he describes is true: there is a misunderstanding between what scientists are doing and what the public thinks the scientists are doing. His little asides (rants) are fun, too.- This was a very informative book for just being a collection of 5-10 page essays. If you're new to astrophysics, the universe and particles, this stuff is like gold -- I don't think I've seen/heard any of the phenomena explained in a clearer way. If you're not new to any of this, then you probably shouldn't be reading this because you've probably already read it. Unless you really like it.Issues for some people, but weren't issues for me:- I understand that some people may go, ""Ugh, why does everything that has to do with science bring up religion and God!"" Tyson does dedicate a whole section of the book to (omg) 3 essays dealing with religion's place in science. He does so tactfully and tastefully. I'm not a religious person, but I don't think he would have offended anyone. And besides, religion and science have been at each others' throats since the dawn of both. If a popular astrophysicist didn't bring it up, someone would have asked why he didn't bring it up.- There's some repetition going on because, if you've read the preface and my review you'll know, this is a collection of essays from a magazine. There's bound to be some repetition because non-sciencey readers need to be reminded that Planck is considered the father of quantum mechanics and that Einstein's theory of relativity is a furthering of Newton's theory of gravity. Honestly, the repetition isn't enough where you would roll your eyes and mutter, ""Redundant.""- Some people may not be okay with Tyson's little rants. In one part he complains about the scientific ignorance going on in Hollywood skylines. Some readers may just want him to stop complaining and shut up already, but he has a right to his discontent. When you're a professional in your field, things that are obviously wrong annoy you more than those that don't belong to your field. You should see how irritated my family gets when I point out the inconsistencies movies have in regards to language and sociolinguistic situations. His annoyance is justified.Basically, what this all boils down to is this:How can you not like a man who dresses in a waistcoat with suns and stars on it?How can you not like a man whose reaction to Newton became a meme?Seriously, though, this book is awesome."
35,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309472-maria,3,"I have one last section to go (Religion and Science), but my main points won't be affected by it.Death By Black Hole provides, especially in the first couple of sections, a really good outline of various problems that astrophysicists are confronted with, and it definitely made me think of the scientific process in a new way. So that was pretty cool. But on the whole, my reaction was rather meh - kind of disappointing when the book really isn't bad. My main complaint about the book isn't actually the book's fault. It's just way below my level, and I found myself frequently bored. I think the best audience for the book is someone who's never had an astronomy class, and is maybe familiar with basic physics and chemistry. I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I read it in high school. I did learn a handful of new things, and sometimes Tyson's explanations helped some points I was fuzzy on click into place, but on the whole, I would have preferred the book to be much more detailed.My second problem is that, as Tyson says in the preface, the book is composed of various essays that he wrote for a magazine over the years, and that they were only slightly edited for continuity when he was preparing the book. Big mistake. While this divided the book into bite-sized, easy to process pieces, it also made it a helluva lot repetitive. Several phenomena were explained two, or even three times throughout the book. It should really have been edited a lot more aggressively.But on the whole, I think this is a really good pick for a layperson who doesn't know much about astronomy and isn't interested in involved explanations of the physical and chemical side of things. Neil deGrasse Tyson is one eloquent guy, and writes with an infectious passion for his subject. "
36,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"As a scientist, at first I was rather bored by this book. I was not learning anything new, and not gaining new insights into astronomy.But, as I read further, it just hit me--this book is tremendously entertaining! If you are a layman, and looking for a unique viewpoint, you could do a lot worse than this book. And, believe it or not, you will be entertained!In addition, Tyson puts several aspects of astronomy and astrophysics into a unique perspective. He describes all the ways that the universe is trying to kill us--storms, viruses, meteors, comets, climate change, volcanoes, and so on. But many of these lethal phenomena could be responsible for life existing on Earth, in the first place!I really did appreciate the arguments put forward against the idea of ""Intelligent Design."" Just because some areas in cosmology are not understood, does not mean that one is required to invoke God as a cause. Science always works on the frontier of knowledge, and if we were always to state that God is responsible for things we do not yet understand, then we would be working on the frontier of ignorance. Tyson does a much better job than I can, in explaining this concept. Highly recommended!"
37,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,4,"Neil is without doubt one of the greatest scientific communicators alive. He is erudite and hilarious with no apparent effort and can always bring the 'wow'.I enjoy his podcast and have probably watched near all videos on youtube that feature him. This is the first time that I have tried his written work and I am very pleased with the results.This work is a collection of editorial pieces that Neil writes for a periodical. They are intended to be short, punchy scientific stories and not form an ongoing dialogue.In this respect Neil did a brilliant job. I dipped in and out of this book over the last couple of weeks and it was simple to pick up again after each break. I read it while doing experiments in the lab, and I read it while on the toilet.What let the collection down (just the tiniest smidgen) was that some material was covered twice. Fine for an ongoing column and understandable for a collection, but still, a little work could have been taken to cull and back reference sections.Don't get me wrong, I adored this book. And anyone who has not discovered love for Neil needs to read it immediately. You'll definitely connect with him if you are sceptical, scientific or just a spotter of bullshit.This book left me wanting more. I want some long form stories, woven into a larger narrative. I have 'The Pluto Files' on my shelf. Maybe it won't be long before I open it."

I also find science fascinating. I'm just not sure what happen between me and Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries.....Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for a science-y book. Maybe I over estimated my intelligence. Both are quite possible. The whole time I was listening to this, it was like listening to Charlie Browns teacher. whaa wha whaa wha whaa Galileo, wha wha E=mc2, whaa whaa whaa Gravity sucks.I would get some really good, crunchy tidbit and be riveted.....and then the mind would drift to something like ""I wonder if I fed the cats, and CRAP I forgot to start the dishwasher""........then I would drift back to the science stuff.It just didn't hold my attention."
39,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37690097-ahmed-r-rashwan,4,"So I have a thing for Black Holes, so what?! You knew that already! You didn't? Well now you do.I have had an obsession with Black Holes for as long as I can remember. It was perhaps one of the first phenomena of the big umbrella of Astronomy and Cosmology that I was introduced to and I immediately fell in love with; I mean what is there not to love. An equal or even grander obsession is awarded of course to the author of this brilliant book.Of course, as with almost all scientific books, the title is pretty elusive. Yes, there was talk of Black Holes, a lot of talk, but there was a slew of other cosmological subjects too! But, of course, you will hear absolutely no complaints from me. As my favourite astronomer, I am inspired by Neil deGrasse Tyson much in the same way he was probably inspired by Carl Sagan.There is probably no other human beings on this planet that have invested more to the field of astronomy like Sagan and Tyson have. I, of course, do not mean this in a scientific sense but a commercial one. Sagan and Tyson are to Astronomy what Bill Nye is to Science.So for all intends and purposes, this review is in fact a form of praising for Neil deGrasse Tyson and his meaning to me as a person rather than a review of the actual book. There are simply some people out there who's literary work is completely overshadowed by their contributions to the subject upon which they write about, so I will dismiss the small quantity of repetitiveness inherent in all scientific books (especially ones comprising of several essays).They tell you never to meet your heroes, that it is somehow inevitable to be disappointed by such an interaction; that the perfect image you have most definitely built of your heroes is most certainly to fall short of reality. But while I cannot claim to have met Neil deGrasse Tyson, I have at least had a closer glimpse to his personal opinions and thoughts. I shied away from this book for the longest time specifically for fear of being disappointed by the literary work of a person I probably hold the highest esteem of amongst all people.I don't even recall when or how I was first ""introduced"" to Neil but what followed was an obsession that has lasted years, till this day. I have probably watched his 'Cosmos' show, inspired by Carl Sagan's Cosmos up to at least 5 times. Neil is funny, witty, intelligent and very very charismatic. If it wasn't for him, there would have definitely been so many different aspects of astronomy that I wouldn't have particularly grabbed. His style of ""story-telling"" transports you back to a time when anything interested you, when your explorer genes were yet to be suppressed; just like you were a little kid again. So it comes as no surprise that I read the entire book imagining Neil was narrating it to me, for I had completely memorised his pattern of speech and voice, and it is equally not surprising that I would love any work, literary or otherwise that Neil produces.I ask nothing more of men of science, to be able to pass down the passion in the way that Neil has been very successful in doing is the calling for all of scientists, regardless of their field of study."

I’m glad I have the paperback edition as well because I most definitely will be re-reading this! However, still wonderful and I always enjoy Neil Degrasse Tyson’s sense of humor even though most of the puns went over my head. "
41,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1306562-josh,1,"For me this book was merely okay. I've read quite a bit of these types of books, physics for the layperson, and this book was probably my least favorite.I don't like the overall tone of the book. Tyson makes a point to belittle the human race as much as possible and he comes across as pessimistic. By no means do I think humans are the pinnacle of perfection, but I think we're doing pretty well.The content of the book was all over the place and only briefly touched on black holes and other cosmic quandaries. In fact the titular cosmological event, though an ""entire"" chapter, was hardly described while long tangents about minor events in historical figures' lives were expounded in detail.I don't recommend this book to any but those that are cursorily interested in cosmology. I recommend Hawking, Brian Greene or Amir Aczel."
42,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14386596-christopher,4,"There isn't anything particularly advanced in this book, though as it is a collection of essays, perhaps that is expected.

43,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1536431-leslie,4,"If the lovely fact that our sun will probably burn out in 4 billion years and our beloved Earth will turn into a huge ball of black rock because of it (until it's vaporized that is) bothers you, keeps you up in the night, this book might not be for you. If you're worried about an asteroid hitting somewhere between Hawaii and California in 2039 and Idaho becoming ocean front property (hmm, maybe an improvement?), then this book might not be for you. If you're worried about what might happen to you if you inadvertently get a little, tinsy bit too close to a black hole of death! (even your atoms get pulled apart) then again, I might not read this book. Because, if you thought your ulcer was healing and you could eat salsa with your chips again. Think again! A collection of essays about a myriad of cosmic topics from Natural History magazine written by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson (you've probably seen him on PBS, and no he's not the night sky guy with the weird voice), this book entertains. Frightens. Enlightens. And inevitably makes you feel much, much smarter for reading it. But believe me, sometimes this knowledge is a scary, scary thing! In fact, now I'd like to take some of it back. Oh, brain atrophy!Except for a few about half way through that made my eyes start to glaze over, I found most of these essays really interesting and readable. Tyson is obviously one of those well known science professionals who is actually interested in, and good at, teaching (believe it or not!) instead of just doing research and publishing. So yes, they do exist..Way, oh way back in the dark ages when I was in college I took a series of physics classes from an astronaut named Don Lind. He was a cocky ass who said stuff like, if you ever get a chance to fly in space.. . I wanted to slap him...anyway, I remember learning about prisms and color and how our brain interprets it, and thinking that was the coolest thing! I remember telling my twelve year old sister about it, about how a prism works and why we are able to see that myriad of colors without moving our eyes (look it up, it's really cool!). She looked at me like I was a martian from outer space who'd just landed and interrupted an episode of Get Smart, and made fun of me for years because of it. Well, neiner neiner. Now I feel vindicated.Sort of..Crap, she's probably still making fun of me. Oh well.. "

According to her numbers, that leaves 0.0000004 planets with intelligent life on them, which is a figure somewhat lower than “millions.” No doubt that “one in a million” sounds better on screen than “one in ten,” but you can’t fake math. The book did have it's flaws, some repetitions and some dull moments , but just a few.If you like the subject….. read this book. "

Neil goes over some really interesting concepts, but they aren't what I would say for advanced readers. Much like his work on Cosmos, the concepts are simple but entertaining and informative. This is a book you could give to beginners who are just dipping their toes into astronomy, physics and earth space sciences. Like always, it's written in a warmer tone than say, Dawkins or Hitchens, and is even more accessible than Hawking although his works are written for the every day person as well. I wouldn't say this is for kids, but kids who are ""advanced"" in reading and sciences would get a kick out of this. I'd love to meet this guy one day. Him, Bill Nye, Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking sparked my love of science in my high school years, and it became an obsession in my adulthood. Thanks, guys. "

to deny or erase the rich, colorful history of scientists and other thinkers who have invoked divinity in their work would be intellectually dishonest. surely there's an appropriate place for intelligent design to live in the academic landscape. how about the history of religion? how about philosophy or psychology? the one place it doesn't belong is the science classroom.if you're not swayed by academic arguments, consider the financial consequences. allow intelligent design into science textbooks, lecture halls, and laboratories, and the cost to the frontier of scientific discovery - the frontier that drives the economies of the future - would be incalculable. i don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed and therefore beyond their intellectual capacity. the day that happens, americans will just sit in awe of what we don't understand, while we watch the rest of the world boldly go where no mortal has gone before.

49,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879178-kathy,3,"A great title for a book, that alone made me want to read it. Of course, this is the type of book I will almost always pick up from the library. It is a collection of essays on science for the magazine Natural History. It covers a wide range of topics, usually relating to physics, from particle physics to astrophysics. I love this stuff and I only wish I retained enough math to be able to read more technical discussions than these rather general essays.The essays are informative and entertaining. A lot has changed in the 17 years since I took my particle physics class at BYU, so I am always interested to learn more. Not only does he describe what is happening in science, he describes the edges very well. By edges I mean the places where scientists are not sure what is happening and are actively searching for answers. That is always the most interesting part of any science. The problem today is that to get to that edge, you have to take years of schooling to understand what they are looking for. Once the edge could be explored in your home lab or a field (if you were Benjamin Franklin) now you need millions of dollars and a space telescope.The book is a bit repetitive, though that often happens with collections of essays because each one had to be self contained and couldn't refer to last month's issue. There has been a bit of editing to smooth out the sequencing and to make it an easier read.While I enjoyed all the essays, I took exception to the last one, entitled, The Perimeter of Ignorance. Here is the author's basic premise, Writing in centuries past, many scientists felt compelled to wax poetic about cosmic mysteries and God's handiwork. Perhaps one should not be surprised at this: most scientists back then, as well as many scientists today, identify themselves as spiritually devout. But a careful reading of older texts, particularly those concerned with the universe itself, shows that the authors invoke divinity only when they reach the boundaries of their understanding. They appeal to a higher power only when staring at the ocean of their own ignorance. They call on God only from the lonely and precarious edge of incomprehension. Where they feel certain about their explanations, however, God hardly gets a mention.He goes on from this hypothesis to give some quotes from Newton and other scientists, who do indeed see an explanation for the unexplainable in the presence of God. He then links this tendency to the current vogue for intelligent design. That also follows, more or less. I have my own issues with intelligent design, at least how it is being explained and used in the public sphere, but I won't go into all that here. The problem I have is that the author considers an appeal to deity as an admission of failure and the mental equivalent of throwing up your hands and saying, ""Heck if I know, only God could figure that out, I will just go find something easier to study, like Paris Hilton."" He says, in talking about intelligent design and the dangers of it, I don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed and therefore beyond their intellectual capacity.Since when is saying something is divinely designed the same as saying we are not capable of understanding it? As a devout person, but one who would have been a scientist, if not for a few chance decisions and a problem with basic arithmetic, I find everything divinely inspired, even those things we do understand. Too many people equate religion with ignorance, without considering the fact that the intelligent people who believe, must have a valid reason for doing so. And similarly, there are many ignorant people who have no religion. I cringe whenever a particularly proud, ignorant and Christian person is on the news saying something stupid because that just reinforces this ignorance=religion stereotype. I'm here to say intelligence=true religion. Believing in ignorance is just superstition whatever belief it may be. The more you understand your own beliefs, the more you want to learn. Our brains are designed to increase in knowledge, anything that does that helps all of us, no matter what the information may be."
50,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,3,"DEATH BY BLACK HOLE AND OTHER COSMIC QUANDARIES BY NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: An astrophysicist for the American Museum of Natural History, director of the world famous Hayden Planetarium, and columnist for Natural History magazine, Neil DeGrasse Tyson brings to the non-scientific world the ideal book for those fascinated with space, the cosmos, black holes, and all the questions and wonders therein. Death by Black Hole is the perfect book for the reader who wants answers to questions about the universe in a simple and clearly defined way so that even if they know next to nothing about science and it’s jargon, Tyson makes it easily understandable.While I was hoping for something a little more in depth in the style of Brian Greene’s The Fabric of the Cosmos or Lee Smolin’s The Trouble With Physics, Death by Black Hole nevertheless provides quick and simple answers to many questions everyday readers without a science background have about physics, the universe, space, and most matters dealing with the cosmos. The book is a selection of his columns in Natural History that are organized in a somewhat textbook fashion. Tyson starts with the idea of science and nature in its basic form, how humanity views Earth, the solar system, the universe. Along with this discussion, Tyson also gives minor history lessons on the development of different ideas in physics and astronomy, what people came up with what big ideas and how the progression led to the development of the big theories of our current time with string theory and relativity. Going on from here, Death by Black Hole address the crucial steps that led to the formation of the universe and its development over the many billions and billions of years, again explaining how it is that scientists know what they do and what instruments were used, as well as the history of who invented and used said instruments.It is then that Tyson finally turns to the subject matter of the title of the book in the section “When the Universe Turns Bad: All the Ways the Cosmos Wants to Kill Us.” Here he addresses the complex and still relatively unknown subjects of chaos theory, dark matter (which constitutes over 90% of all matter in the universe, while we still know next to nothing about it), and finally black holes. Tyson takes the reader on a hypothetical journey with what would happen if one were to be sucked into a black hole and how as they approached the event horizon, they would become stretched until the elasticity point of their skin was surpassed and the body would be torn into thousands then millions of little pieces.With many questions now answered, in the next section Tyson discusses how science is viewed by the media, Hollywood, and people around the world in general. The final section addresses the concept of science and religion, again taking the reader on a historic journey through the development of first religion, then science, and the struggle that has ensued for centuries. It is the perfect end to a book on science, as Tyson lectures the importance of supporting fact and reality in a time when there are many who believe more in faith, even when all the evidence is to the contrary.For more book reviews, and author interviews, go to BookBanter."
51,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558652-emma-sea,3,"My main dissatisfaction with this book is that it's a series of collected magazine columns. This does seem a bit like criticising an apple because it's not a banana, however I think Tyson would have be been better advised to hire an editor to whip this into an actual book, rather than just reprint the original short essays. For example, in chapter 25 Tyson critiques the concept of the ""Goldilocks Zone"", discussing the myriad ways life could flourish in environments entirely dissimilar to our own e.g. in seas of liquid ammonia or methane. But then in the following chapter Tyson contends that life will only originate on a planet with a temperature that allows liquid water i.e. in the Goldilocks Zone. Originally these essays would have been published months or years apart, but juxtaposed like this it is a frustrating read, to say the least.The other problem with short essays is that things just start to get interesting and it's over. In chapter 21 Tyson briefly mentions technetium; an element with a half-life of only 2 million years, but which is nevertheless found in red giant stars. ""In other words, the star cannot have been born with the stuff, for if it were there would be none left by now. There is also no known mechanism to create technetium in a star's core and have it dredge itself up to the surface where it is observed, which has led to exotic theories that have yet to achieve consensus in the astrophysics community""But you know, those diverse and exotic theories are exactly what I'd like to hear about! That was the most interesting part of the book for me, and it just gets left lying gasping on the floor.Also, sadly, the book is aimed at someone who has done little or no prior science reading; a far broader generalist audience that I hoped for. I 100% agree with Maria's review, when she says this would be a good high-school-level book. If you don't generally read pop-science, but would like to learn more about how our universe works, I definitely recommend this book. Tyson is a great writer: engaging and able to explain complex ideas simply, with a dash of humour.For me it's a 2.5, rounded up."
52,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2593734-nicholas-armstrong,2,"I can already see the masses of Tyson fans charging ahead just to light me aflame for having the audicity to doubt a word he says, but so I must. To be fair, I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. I saw him speak at USC, I've watched his lectures and his interviews, and I think he has done more for popularizing science than anyone else. But none of that a writer makes. This is especially true of sarcastic and sardonic wit. Being funny in text is what I would rate as the most challenging things to accomplish (some comics may agree) because it loses so much of the presence, tone, and body language that makes something funny. Tyson is a legitimately funny person, I promise this, but aside from the knowledge that he wrote this, none of that translates well. I could guess that this is because much of his humor is in his intonations, pauses, and timing, something any classclown can tell you about. But not any classclown can write a best-selling comedic novel, nor can just any astro-physicist write a truly comic novel, or at least one which transfers that genius.What I'm getting at is that this book is dry. It seeks to inform, but it does so in a way that is just a little bit uninteresting and just a little bit reminscent of my astronomy courses. Interesting stuff, but the delivery was just all wrong.This wasn't assisted by the fact that the structuring of the book is terrible. To be fair, Tyson admits at the outset that this is little more than a collection of essays slapped back to back and tidied up a bit to try and make them fit, but that is exactly how they read. The transitions are generally poor and always jarring. The sentences don't blend together so much as float like an oily film, and trying to read too many consectutive pieces put together makes me feel as if my brain were a poorly done game of tetris - too many holes and not enough matching lines.But hey, I'm for anything that gets people reading, and I'm especially for anything that gets people reading about the world and about science. It goes without saying that I'm far happier this book is out there and so widely read than never having been published. I just prattle on because I'm a snot-nose with too many standards."
53,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5495893-leana-m,5,Well written and great stuff for the universe geek (or anyone with the slightest interest and curiosity for learning). NDT adds some fun with his quirks and humor. Allow me to indulge in a little pun here- And it ends with a bang. ;) 
54,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6071693-dale-jr,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson has become a bit of an inspiration and scientific hero to me. He's a man who strongly pushes forth to erase scientific ignorance and champions the exploration of our world and the universe to further human greatness.His lectures are intensely interesting and full of scientific knowledge, yet easy to follow by anyone willing to listen and apply their minds. He boils down some of the most complex theories and scientific facts so that they're easily understood. His writing is no different.I've been diving further and further into astrophysics and varying theories in related fields (string and multiverse theory is, simply put, awesome). This journey has made me quite familiar with Tyson and I figured it was about time to pick up one of his texts.Death by Black Hole is a collection of essays and lectures spanning the entire field of astrophysics and cosmology. From the Big Bang, to the life cycles of stars. From the speed of light to the mind-boggling power of black holes. There's even a section where Tyson describes the three biggest ways our world will come to an end. And it has nothing to do with ancient Mayan prophecy or the second coming.When scientifically investigating the natural world the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier.Since it is a collection of various lectures and essays, some information is repeated here and there, but it does not detract from the wealth of knowledge contained between the covers. I learned a lot. Retained most of it in one reading due to Tyson's way of writing and explaining. This is a book full of information, yet you never feel like your reading something as dry as a text book. Tyson makes you want to keep reading. He injects humor along with serious scientific education.I'm glad that his book lived up to my expectations of him and I will be sure to pick up his others. Quite frankly, this was the best non-fiction book I've read this year. Wonderfully executed and easily devoured. I feel both filled with new knowledge, and humbled by the amount I, and the rest of my human brothers and sisters, do not know yet.But as Tyson lays out in his book, it's not wrong to be ignorant of something as long as you are continuing to try and figure it out.Science is a philosophy of discovery. Intelligent design is a philosophy of ignorance. You cannot build a program of discovery on the assumption that nobody is smart enough to figure out the answer to the problem. Once upon a time, people identified the god Neptune as the source of storms at sea. Today we call these storms hurricanes. We know when and where they start. We know what drives them. We know what mitigates their destructive power. And anyone who has studied global warming can tell you what makes them worse. The only people who still call hurricanes ""acts of God"" are the people who write insurance forms."
55,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96664-samantha,4,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. His humor and straightforwardness were some of the best things about the History Channel documentary, The Universe. And his lectures on YouTube are always extremely inventive, interesting, and entertaining. So when I saw this book on the shelf at my local bookstore, I had to buy it.I wasn't disappointed.Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed learning about the universe. I'll never be an astrophysicist, but it always fascinates me to learn about all that's out there (and all that may be out there that we have yet to discover). Of course, the language of the cosmos is complicated: nebulae, pulsars, quasars, supernovas, black holes, event horizons, dark matter, antimatter, etc., etc.That's where Dr. Tyson comes in. He has an uncanny ability to take something that is unfailingly complex to the 'average' person such as myself and explain it in a way that I can understand. And he does so with unsurpassed humor, wit, and even the slightest bit of self-deprecation.In the end, he says, the universe is out to kill us. In many, many ways. And even though there is a lot we still don't understand about the universe and how it began and where it's going, that doesn't mean we stop looking. There is always more to learn, there is always more to discover, and if the essays in his book are any indication, it is all utterly fascinating.The last part of the book deals with science and religion. Dr. Tyson claims that being a scientist doesn't necessarily preclude belief in God. However, he staunchly claims that God has no business in scientific discovery, that simply crediting God with creating all the things that science can't currently explain opens the door to the cessation of scientific discovery. He quotes Galileo, who said, ""I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.""If the science vs. God debate makes you uncomfortable, have no fear--it's a very small part of the book, tucked in at the very end after all the terrific science essays.I highly recommend this book, even if you're only slightly interested in the universe. "
56,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2751053-bakari,5,"Astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson‘s Death By Black Hole is definitely an engaging read, especially for these modern times. Though many pages and chapters about the particulars of matter, energy, space, and time—the physics of the universe—were very difficult for my scientifically illiterate mind to comprehend, I read nearly ever page for nuggets of understanding. Tyson is a excellent writer because he knows his subject matter. Just think how different our Bible reading population would be if Tyson had wrote the Book of Genesis. His “in the beginning“ would have probably talked about the discoveries and meaning of supernovas, as the “primary source for the origin and relative mix of heavy elements in the universe.” He would have verses about Newton’s laws of motion and early twentieth century theories about quantum mechanics. His creation story would not be described in a mere seven days; his story would talk about billions of years—more time than most of us can imagine. But of course, the Bible was written in an era which lacked the scientific discoveries that Tyson writes about. But, but...this is what makes Death By Black Hole, and other books similar to it, so important. Reading a book like this provides us more knowledge about the universe and who we are as homo sapiens than Biblical writers could ever imagine. We simply need the education, patience, and study to learn what has been discovered. Though we are not, as Tyson writes in his essay, “Fear of Numbers,” “wired for logical thinking,” the brain, as he goes on to say, is “a marvelously flexible organ.” And in my view it’s time that more and more of us start using our brain to its greatest potential. Believing and praying to gods and reading horoscopes are no longer sufficient for our survival as a species. We can do much, much better than that.Perhaps a few months from now, I’ll read another of Tyson‘s books, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution, and view the PBS companion special as I do. It will be much like viewing the Carl Sagan’s Cosmos back in my college days. "
57,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4826452-evan-wondrasek,5,"Death by Black Hole is one of the most interesting non-fiction science books I've ever read. It's a collection of essays published by Neil deGrasse Tyson over the last 10+ years, and provides great, down-to-earth explanations of amazing astrophysics phenomena. This isn't a book about farfetched scenarios as its title implies - only a single chapter was actually about ""death by black hole"" - but the rest of the book presented a thorough and highly scientific explanation of the universe as we know it.Being that this book wasn't written as one cohesive text (it's a summary of essays as I mentioned), there is some informational overlap between the chapters. You'll be introduced to people like Galileo, Keppler, and Huygens more than once. I didn't mind at all, and I thought the overlap helped me solidify information.My favorite part of this book the crazy facts about celestial scale it presented. For example, the book states that a photon of light takes something like 500 seconds to go from the Sun's surface to the surface of earth; conversely, that same photon took upwards of 100,000 years to go from the Sun's core to the Sun's surface. Read the book and you'll learn why :)"
58,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3110398-sean,4,"I feel that the reason that people do not understand science in the US today is because we have a foolish tradition of thinking that the only way to ""know"" physics is through the terse formalism of mathematics. Math is a tool to do science, as much as a microscope or a superconducting supercollider. The disservice we do as scientists are when we are unable to communicate the concepts about our physical world to the population at large because we tangle ourselves up in mathematical formalism.Neil DeGrasse Tyson will never have that criticism hurled against him.It is in the tradition of Sagan, Gribbin and Hawking that Tyson writes and his essays are pure delight, discussing the concepts of physics as though he was having a casual coffee talk. It makes science fun. Yes your brain will come alive, but for a basic understanding of our physical world, this book should be read and I can't wait to read another by him.I even learned that laser spectroscopists and chemists label the same energy transitions differently. Awesome."
59,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4983144-colleen,4,"This is a great introduction into the world of astrophysics for the lay person. It's funny and engaging in a way you couldn't imagine a book about astrophysics being (without reading this book). How did it all begin and where are we going are just some of the cosmic quandaries that are tackled. It even has a whole section on how many ways the planet and its life could end! Fun stuff for a nerd like me. Plus, it touches on many other science/culture conundrums that are great food for thought. It was a tiny redundant, owing to the fact that these are all previously written essays collected for purpose of the book. But, I actually liked the redundancy. It allowed more time for the heavy science behind astrophysics to sink in, and I became more familiar with the scientists that propelled our cosmic knowledge forward. Overall, it was a great read. It was a refreshing break from the day-to-day politics and tedium that can make our lives feel very small. From the advantage of science, it truly put our Earthly lives into a cosmic perspective."
60,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a force to reckon with. But he is not Carl Sagan. While Sagan must have smiled down kindly on your meek acknowledgement of ignorance regarding, say, black holes, Tyson will have most probably given you the stink eye or aimed a sarcastic jibe at your apathy, before proceeding to explain why black holes still remain a topic of much speculation in the community of astrophysicists worldwide.Tyson does not pull any punches in this collection of essays while slamming the news media, who more often than not, come off as ill-informed hacks doing a shoddy job of reporting facts in the field of space science, forever (stupidly) claiming how scientists are baffled by so-and-so new developments. 
""Scientists cannot claim to be on the research frontier unless one thing or another baffles them. Bafflement drives discovery.""
Or snidely commenting on the Hollywood exercise of producing multi-million dollar sci-fi films which badly butcher the scientific aspects of such ventures by inserting factually incorrect observations in scenes and dialogues. (there's a brilliant anecdote concerning James Cameron's 'Titanic' in this regard and the Contact film gets an honorable mention for its adherence to proper science if one overlooks a minor gaffe)
""I am glad that, in the end, the humans win. We conquer the 'Independence Day' aliens by having a Macintosh laptop computer upload a software virus to the mothership. [] The entire defense system for the alien mothership must have been powered by the same release of Apple Computer's system software as the laptop computer that delivered the virus.""
Or criticizing the mad dash for extending the frontiers of space science during the Cold war years, when the spirit of scientific inquiry was sidelined in favor of a dangerous game of political one-upmanship, a kind of puerile assertion of 'our scientists are better than yours'. Or openly chastising revered names from ancient Greece like Aristotle whose inaccurate assumptions about the unchanging nature of stars and the geocentric universe helped the Catholic Church in propagating falsities for centuries with impunity. (He doesn't even spare Newton for God's Higgs Boson's sake who, unable to satisfactorily explain the ordered behavior of the solar system despite the many often conflicting gravitational forces at work, had cited God's need to step in to correct things in his famed 'Principia')While Sagan may have adopted a more benign, less aggressive tone in course of addressing issues of religious dogma being at loggerheads with scientific reasoning and aversion to science and mathematics among the general populace, NDT takes the approach of pure, unadulterated logic and demolishes one popular misconception after another (for e.g.:-the North Star is not the most brilliant star in the night sky or how everything that goes up doesn't come down) with a brute force which I am certain will not sit well with some sensitive readers who are easily offended. Being born in a country whose space research organization head performs pujas and makes ritualistic offerings prior to launching a 'Mission to Mars', I can't say I fault NDT's acerbic tone or his distaste for those who are hell-bent on unifying science and religion without even realizing that finding common ground between both is akin to attempting to exceed the velocity of light. But if NDT lacks Sagan's sage-like demeanour and his rich, authorial voice (Sagan's prose is much more refined no doubt), his excellent sense of humor almost compensates for their absence - 
""The good thing about the laws of physics is that they require no law enforcement agencies to maintain them, although I once owned a nerdy T-shirt that loudly proclaimed, ""OBEY GRAVITY.""

""The only people who still call hurricanes 'acts of God' are the people who write insurance forms.""
(and Michele Bachmann, just saying)And occasionally there's a sop thrown in for the literary-minded (particularly the postmodernist fiction lover) - ""The physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who in 1964 proposed the existence of quarks, and who at the time thought the quark family had only three members, drew the name from a characteristically elusive line in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake: 'Three quarks for Muster Mark!'""
The more frivolous aspects of the essays aside, among the astrophysics-related topics NDT centers his discussions around, the ones which were relatively new to me are the concepts of hypernovae, gamma ray bursts, dark matter and dark energy, the uncertainty surrounding the string theory and the probability of the annihilation of Earth through ill-fated, cosmic encounters with errant asteroids, the unavoidable, impending collision of our galaxy with the Andromeda galaxy which is the nearest one heading towards us at a speed of more than 100 kilometers per second.The Andromeda GalaxySince this is a collection of 42 essays which were published in the 'Natural History' magazine, some repetition of concepts and names creeps in occasionally but that merely helps you refresh memories of what you just read a few pages back, not exactly a shortcoming I am keen to quibble over. 4 stars, because Tyson seems a little too bitter about artists who exercise 'artistic license' to distort certain astronomical facts in their paintings. Besides I am certain there is a lot of 5-star-worthy goodness in the rest of NDT's works left for me to discover in the future."
61,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"This is a very fun read for all you science nerds... not only being clear and humorous but wide-ranging and careful to build up a number of those necessary building blocks of knowledge but doing it precisely in order to slam you with the good stuff later.Like how you'd DIE IN A BLACK HOLE... :)To belabor the obvious by the title. :)Seriously, this book gives us a ton of great ways to die and not just by black hole. I really appreciated that. :)I'd characterize this book as an easy to intermediate stage science book that's very far from being dull and it has a minimum of equations. I'm sure everyone has heard of thermodynamics and E=MC squared and Drake's equation, after all, but what really thrilled me about this was the truly wide array of subjects and Tyson's conversational tone.You can tell he is still a very, very good science teacher. :)I can almost hear him say, ""Let's throw out the crap, folks, let's dive right into the good stuff."" And he does, ranging from the Big Bang to the Heat Death, kinds of possible life on planets, the building blocks we need to understand science, including a great ""stick"" analogy for understanding the universe without computers, and he even gets into a bit of politics and religion because let's face it: it's a hot discussion item. But thankfully, it's only there as an afterthought.I wanted science and I got science, exploring the planets, the sun, even quasars, and especially Black Holes. That's the yummy stuff, after all.  10/10 Black Holes agree! Nom nom nom nom nom. I totally recommend this for both laymen and the intelligently curious and for anyone else who just likes a bit of the good (science) life. It really, really helps that Tyson's a great writer and clear as glass. The light passes right through it without slowing down at all! Can you believe it?"

In high school, while we were supposed to be studying the musculature of the formaldehyde-soaked amphibians pinned ignominiously to their coffinesque metal trays, I was far more interested in studying the effects of adding fire to small green buds. During my brief time wandering the hallways of the University world, I was able to do away with my prerequisite requirement by taking an “Arts of Science” course tailor-made for those more interested in empathy than entropy and, while I did manage to get a crocodile on my report card, all I took away from that class was an abiding hatred for hippies. The long and the short of all this is that I didn’t know a quasar from a neutron or a brown dwarf from a red giant (though Red Dwarf was a magnificent television series).As a devout lover of science fiction and hi-tech gadgetry of all sorts, this was a matter of not a little shame for me. To resolve this I decided that it was time for me to fill in some of the (immense) gaps in my education the best way I know how- via book. Yet how to avoid having my eyes glaze over the moment someone started explaining cell structures or complex wave fields? Fortunately, as it often does, my television provided a solution when Stephen Colbert took a visit to the American Museum of Natural Historys Hayden Planetarium and spoke with its Director, Neil deGrasse Tyson. Tyson, while just as geeky as you would expect from an astrophysicist, is phenomenally skilled at taking incredibly complex scientific theories and translating them into a Common English that even Stephen Colbert is able to understand. My fate was sealed. This man was the ideal author to ease myself into the brave new world of stellar science.Death by Black Hole is a collection of essays the Tyson penned for Natural History magazine over the course of several years. Each essay addresses a different topic, running the gamut from the birth of the universe, the history of astronomical discoveries, humankind’s fixation on the red hills of Mars and the life-bringing water that may lay frozen away, all the way to the Pluto Wars (it’s amazing just how contentious Pluto’s status as planet is). Of course there’s some overlap between the chapters and some facts get repeated but, rather than bugging me, I found it to be a good refresher of what had come before that helped solidify my basic understanding of the concepts at hand. Most interesting to me, policy junkie that I am, is the closing essay in which Tyson writes about the plague of scientific ignorance sweeping the country. After almost brutally doing away with that Bible-in-textbook-clothing anachronism that is “intelligent design,” he makes great points about America’s waning prestige in scientific research and the future costs, both economic and academic, that we will have to pay due to ceding our intellectual priority to advance knowledge. I’m not much interested in sustaining American supremacy in any field, but I can always get behind an argument for strengthening education.What I most enjoyed was the excitement that Tyson has for his field. He doesn’t get bogged down in the minutiae of atomic weights and the like, but thrills at the possibilities of quantum mechanics and takes an almost excessive amount of joy in ruminating over the possible ways that people can be killed in space from the atom-splitting nullification of crossing a black hole’s event horizon to the persistent fear of a species-leveling asteroid striking Earth. Tyson is a man possessed of a childlike sense of wonder at the mysteries of the universe that sees the current limits of our scientific understanding not as having reached the final frontiers of science but as hurdles to be vaulted over in our quest to know. His enthusiasm is quite contagious and I challenge any reader to emerge from this book without being excited about science."
63,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"I have often lamented the passing of my favorite popular scientist, Carl Sagan, by talking about how necessary he is right now. We are at a point in our history where scientific illiteracy is growing, where people are not only ignorant of how science works, but are proud of their ignorance. What we need is someone who can reach the majority of Americans who are not especially scientifically literate - the people whose automatic reaction to science is to think, ""That's just too hard for me to deal with.""Enter Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and the director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. He's appeared on countless television programs, including The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, to talk about the current state of astronomy and astrophysics. He's an engaging and entertaining man, who claims that Pluto was ""asking for"" its demotion, who seems to take perverse pleasure in describing all the terrible ways the universe could take us out. He knows that we're in a precarious position, here on Earth, and he revels in it rather than worrying about it. Whereas Sagan seemed to come from the point of view that the universe was a place of infinite wonder, where one could look anywhere and be awed and humbled, Tyson's attitude is more of the universe as an infinite theme park - a place where you could see your electrons stripped from your body, watch gas clouds larger than our own solar system collide and ignite, or see planets crumple under cosmic bombardment. Tyson's universe is an adventure, as big as it gets.This book is a collection of essays that Tyson wrote for Natural History magazine over a ten year period, on a variety of subjects related to science and scientific inquiry. In many ways, it's similar to every other pop science book out there - and there are so very many of them - but it is his perspective and his voice that makes this one stand out from the crowd.He's grouped his essays into seven sections, on topics ranging from the difficulties inherent in actually knowing anything about the universe to the understanding of how life went from little mindless bacteria to we clever Homo sapiens to the intersection of science and religion. Most of it is accessible to the average non-scientist, though he does get a little technical at points. But he understands that, and he tries to compensate for for the fact that, by and large, the public is intimidated by ""real science."" In the essay entitled, ""Over the Rainbow,"" he discusses this particular challenge by using spectroscopy as an example.In spectroscopy, astrophysicists look at the spectrum of a star, hunting for telltale dark lines that indicate the physical properties of stars. It's like looking at a rainbow with bits blackened out of it, as though the CIA had somehow gotten to it first. Those black lines contain all the vital information about the star's composition and, more importantly, speed. Very little can be gleaned by just looking at the star, as it turns out. He notes five levels of abstraction, starting from the star itself:Level 0: A starLevel 1: Picture of a starLevel 2: Light from the picture of a starLevel 3: Spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.Level 4: Patterns of lines lacing the spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.Level 5: Shifts in the patterns of lines in the spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.These descending levels of abstraction can apply to any branch of science, not just astrophysics. The challenge, as he notes, is getting people past level 1, which is easy to understand but is not the level at which true science is done. It is up to educators, he says, to help make people comfortable with looking at real science, and not just pretty pictures.Indeed, there are several sections of the book dedicated to the intersection between science and the public. He talks about how easily we are baffled by numbers (why are below-ground floors not labeled -1, -2, -3 etc?) and how casually we disregard actual scientific facts. He brings up some of his favorite moments in bad movie science, and how he single-handedly saved Titanic from ignominious astronomical shame. At least, on its DVD re-release. He addresses the historically shifting centers of science in human history, how things like NASA are truly a global endeavor. Without the discoveries made through history by people all over the planet - from England to Greece to Baghdad - there would be no NASA, nor any science that we recognize. And to assume that the United States will always be the center of scientific discovery is to willfully ignore history.And, of course, there's a section dedicated to the conflict between religion and science, a never-ending battle that has existed since science began. Tyson believes that there can be no common ground between the two - science relies on facts, religion relies on faith. This is not to say that one is better than the other, any more than, say, a hammer is better than a screwdriver. It's just that you can't use them interchangeably. And he points out that becoming a scientist doesn't require you to give up your faith. There have been, and still are, countless scientists who are believers in the Divine. It's just that most of them know enough not to confuse science and spirituality. The place where they meet, historically, is on the boundary of ignorance. Isaac Newton, having figured out gravity, couldn't quite work out how you could have a multiple-body system like our solar system without the whole thing falling into chaos. His conclusion - God must, from time to time, step in to keep things on the right path. Having done that, Newton went on to do other things, and it wasn't until the next century that Pierre-Simon laPlace decided that he wasn't satisfied with Newton's ""Insert God Here"" argument, and did the math for himself.In other words, God is a marker on the boundaries of ignorance, and the best of us are tempted to let Him answer the questions that we can't. To do so, however, impedes the path of science and stops progress in its tracks. What if Newton had said, ""No, I'm going to figure this damn thing out."" Would we be a century ahead in our technology by now? Maybe, maybe not. What if the Catholic Church had listened when Galileo said, ""The Bible tells you how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."" Might more progress have been made? So many great thinkers have come up to the boundaries of their knowledge and, humbled by what they do not know, chose to allow The God of the Gaps reassure them.But that's the whole point of science, and it's what this book, and others like it, are trying to instill in people. The unknown is not horrible, it is not terrifying, and it's not a place to just stop. It's a place of awe and wonder and bafflement and opportunity. To say, ""I don't understand it - it must be God"" is short-changing ourselves and our heirs out of even greater knowledge of the universe."
64,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392197-jocelyn,5,"I don't think I can properly explain how much I love this book, but I'll try.Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries is a collection of essays Tyson wrote for Natural History, a magazine dedicated to -- you guessed it -- natural history (basically, science) between 1995-2005.What I like about it:- Tyson writes in a way that's easily accessible for anyone even without a science background. His analogies are easy to understand and they're fun. Like, ""Oh, Neil deGrasse Tyson, you."" Also, he tries to explain complex terms or theories so that you can finish the book and be a pseudo-astrophysicist. Now you can go to dinner parties and impress people with your knowledge about quarks and black holes and radio waves.- Tyson's writing is jovial and light-hearted. He frequently cracks jokes to lighten the mood -- you don't want to be bored. (Of course, I am a huge physics nerd and he could drone on and on about string theory and it could never bore me.) At one point, he jokes about red shirts. Red shirts, people! This guy's a winner.- Tyson takes the time to highlight two ways science (broadly) and astro-/physics (specifically) relate to both theology and culture. The Science and Culture section of the book was interesting, because what he describes is true: there is a misunderstanding between what scientists are doing and what the public thinks the scientists are doing. His little asides (rants) are fun, too.- This was a very informative book for just being a collection of 5-10 page essays. If you're new to astrophysics, the universe and particles, this stuff is like gold -- I don't think I've seen/heard any of the phenomena explained in a clearer way. If you're not new to any of this, then you probably shouldn't be reading this because you've probably already read it. Unless you really like it.Issues for some people, but weren't issues for me:- I understand that some people may go, ""Ugh, why does everything that has to do with science bring up religion and God!"" Tyson does dedicate a whole section of the book to (omg) 3 essays dealing with religion's place in science. He does so tactfully and tastefully. I'm not a religious person, but I don't think he would have offended anyone. And besides, religion and science have been at each others' throats since the dawn of both. If a popular astrophysicist didn't bring it up, someone would have asked why he didn't bring it up.- There's some repetition going on because, if you've read the preface and my review you'll know, this is a collection of essays from a magazine. There's bound to be some repetition because non-sciencey readers need to be reminded that Planck is considered the father of quantum mechanics and that Einstein's theory of relativity is a furthering of Newton's theory of gravity. Honestly, the repetition isn't enough where you would roll your eyes and mutter, ""Redundant.""- Some people may not be okay with Tyson's little rants. In one part he complains about the scientific ignorance going on in Hollywood skylines. Some readers may just want him to stop complaining and shut up already, but he has a right to his discontent. When you're a professional in your field, things that are obviously wrong annoy you more than those that don't belong to your field. You should see how irritated my family gets when I point out the inconsistencies movies have in regards to language and sociolinguistic situations. His annoyance is justified.Basically, what this all boils down to is this:How can you not like a man who dresses in a waistcoat with suns and stars on it?How can you not like a man whose reaction to Newton became a meme?Seriously, though, this book is awesome."
65,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309472-maria,3,"I have one last section to go (Religion and Science), but my main points won't be affected by it.Death By Black Hole provides, especially in the first couple of sections, a really good outline of various problems that astrophysicists are confronted with, and it definitely made me think of the scientific process in a new way. So that was pretty cool. But on the whole, my reaction was rather meh - kind of disappointing when the book really isn't bad. My main complaint about the book isn't actually the book's fault. It's just way below my level, and I found myself frequently bored. I think the best audience for the book is someone who's never had an astronomy class, and is maybe familiar with basic physics and chemistry. I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I read it in high school. I did learn a handful of new things, and sometimes Tyson's explanations helped some points I was fuzzy on click into place, but on the whole, I would have preferred the book to be much more detailed.My second problem is that, as Tyson says in the preface, the book is composed of various essays that he wrote for a magazine over the years, and that they were only slightly edited for continuity when he was preparing the book. Big mistake. While this divided the book into bite-sized, easy to process pieces, it also made it a helluva lot repetitive. Several phenomena were explained two, or even three times throughout the book. It should really have been edited a lot more aggressively.But on the whole, I think this is a really good pick for a layperson who doesn't know much about astronomy and isn't interested in involved explanations of the physical and chemical side of things. Neil deGrasse Tyson is one eloquent guy, and writes with an infectious passion for his subject. "
66,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"As a scientist, at first I was rather bored by this book. I was not learning anything new, and not gaining new insights into astronomy.But, as I read further, it just hit me--this book is tremendously entertaining! If you are a layman, and looking for a unique viewpoint, you could do a lot worse than this book. And, believe it or not, you will be entertained!In addition, Tyson puts several aspects of astronomy and astrophysics into a unique perspective. He describes all the ways that the universe is trying to kill us--storms, viruses, meteors, comets, climate change, volcanoes, and so on. But many of these lethal phenomena could be responsible for life existing on Earth, in the first place!I really did appreciate the arguments put forward against the idea of ""Intelligent Design."" Just because some areas in cosmology are not understood, does not mean that one is required to invoke God as a cause. Science always works on the frontier of knowledge, and if we were always to state that God is responsible for things we do not yet understand, then we would be working on the frontier of ignorance. Tyson does a much better job than I can, in explaining this concept. Highly recommended!"
67,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,4,"Neil is without doubt one of the greatest scientific communicators alive. He is erudite and hilarious with no apparent effort and can always bring the 'wow'.I enjoy his podcast and have probably watched near all videos on youtube that feature him. This is the first time that I have tried his written work and I am very pleased with the results.This work is a collection of editorial pieces that Neil writes for a periodical. They are intended to be short, punchy scientific stories and not form an ongoing dialogue.In this respect Neil did a brilliant job. I dipped in and out of this book over the last couple of weeks and it was simple to pick up again after each break. I read it while doing experiments in the lab, and I read it while on the toilet.What let the collection down (just the tiniest smidgen) was that some material was covered twice. Fine for an ongoing column and understandable for a collection, but still, a little work could have been taken to cull and back reference sections.Don't get me wrong, I adored this book. And anyone who has not discovered love for Neil needs to read it immediately. You'll definitely connect with him if you are sceptical, scientific or just a spotter of bullshit.This book left me wanting more. I want some long form stories, woven into a larger narrative. I have 'The Pluto Files' on my shelf. Maybe it won't be long before I open it."

I also find science fascinating. I'm just not sure what happen between me and Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries.....Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for a science-y book. Maybe I over estimated my intelligence. Both are quite possible. The whole time I was listening to this, it was like listening to Charlie Browns teacher. whaa wha whaa wha whaa Galileo, wha wha E=mc2, whaa whaa whaa Gravity sucks.I would get some really good, crunchy tidbit and be riveted.....and then the mind would drift to something like ""I wonder if I fed the cats, and CRAP I forgot to start the dishwasher""........then I would drift back to the science stuff.It just didn't hold my attention."
69,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37690097-ahmed-r-rashwan,4,"So I have a thing for Black Holes, so what?! You knew that already! You didn't? Well now you do.I have had an obsession with Black Holes for as long as I can remember. It was perhaps one of the first phenomena of the big umbrella of Astronomy and Cosmology that I was introduced to and I immediately fell in love with; I mean what is there not to love. An equal or even grander obsession is awarded of course to the author of this brilliant book.Of course, as with almost all scientific books, the title is pretty elusive. Yes, there was talk of Black Holes, a lot of talk, but there was a slew of other cosmological subjects too! But, of course, you will hear absolutely no complaints from me. As my favourite astronomer, I am inspired by Neil deGrasse Tyson much in the same way he was probably inspired by Carl Sagan.There is probably no other human beings on this planet that have invested more to the field of astronomy like Sagan and Tyson have. I, of course, do not mean this in a scientific sense but a commercial one. Sagan and Tyson are to Astronomy what Bill Nye is to Science.So for all intends and purposes, this review is in fact a form of praising for Neil deGrasse Tyson and his meaning to me as a person rather than a review of the actual book. There are simply some people out there who's literary work is completely overshadowed by their contributions to the subject upon which they write about, so I will dismiss the small quantity of repetitiveness inherent in all scientific books (especially ones comprising of several essays).They tell you never to meet your heroes, that it is somehow inevitable to be disappointed by such an interaction; that the perfect image you have most definitely built of your heroes is most certainly to fall short of reality. But while I cannot claim to have met Neil deGrasse Tyson, I have at least had a closer glimpse to his personal opinions and thoughts. I shied away from this book for the longest time specifically for fear of being disappointed by the literary work of a person I probably hold the highest esteem of amongst all people.I don't even recall when or how I was first ""introduced"" to Neil but what followed was an obsession that has lasted years, till this day. I have probably watched his 'Cosmos' show, inspired by Carl Sagan's Cosmos up to at least 5 times. Neil is funny, witty, intelligent and very very charismatic. If it wasn't for him, there would have definitely been so many different aspects of astronomy that I wouldn't have particularly grabbed. His style of ""story-telling"" transports you back to a time when anything interested you, when your explorer genes were yet to be suppressed; just like you were a little kid again. So it comes as no surprise that I read the entire book imagining Neil was narrating it to me, for I had completely memorised his pattern of speech and voice, and it is equally not surprising that I would love any work, literary or otherwise that Neil produces.I ask nothing more of men of science, to be able to pass down the passion in the way that Neil has been very successful in doing is the calling for all of scientists, regardless of their field of study."

I’m glad I have the paperback edition as well because I most definitely will be re-reading this!

71,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1306562-josh,1,"For me this book was merely okay. I've read quite a bit of these types of books, physics for the layperson, and this book was probably my least favorite.I don't like the overall tone of the book. Tyson makes a point to belittle the human race as much as possible and he comes across as pessimistic. By no means do I think humans are the pinnacle of perfection, but I think we're doing pretty well.The content of the book was all over the place and only briefly touched on black holes and other cosmic quandaries. In fact the titular cosmological event, though an ""entire"" chapter, was hardly described while long tangents about minor events in historical figures' lives were expounded in detail.I don't recommend this book to any but those that are cursorily interested in cosmology. I recommend Hawking, Brian Greene or Amir Aczel."
72,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14386596-christopher,4,"There isn't anything particularly advanced in this book, though as it is a collection of essays, perhaps that is expected.

If you're worried about what might happen to you if you inadvertently get a little, tinsy bit too close to a black hole of death!

A collection of essays about a myriad of cosmic topics from Natural History magazine written by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson (you've probably seen him on PBS, and no he's not the night sky guy with the weird voice), this book entertains. Frightens. Enlightens. And inevitably makes you feel much, much smarter for reading it. But believe me, sometimes this knowledge is a scary, scary thing! In fact, now I'd like to take some of it back. Oh, brain atrophy!Except for a few about half way through that made my eyes start to glaze over, I found most of these essays really interesting and readable. Tyson is obviously one of those well known science professionals who is actually interested in, and good at, teaching (believe it or not!) instead of just doing research and publishing. So yes, they do exist..Way, oh way back in the dark ages when I was in college I took a series of physics classes from an astronaut named Don Lind. He was a cocky ass who said stuff like, if you ever get a chance to fly in space.. . I wanted to slap him...anyway, I remember learning about prisms and color and how our brain interprets it, and thinking that was the coolest thing! I remember telling my twelve year old sister about it, about how a prism works and why we are able to see that myriad of colors without moving our eyes (look it up, it's really cool!). She looked at me like I was a martian from outer space who'd just landed and interrupted an episode of Get Smart, and made fun of me for years because of it. Well, neiner neiner.

According to her numbers, that leaves 0.0000004 planets with intelligent life on them, which is a figure somewhat lower than “millions.” No doubt that “one in a million” sounds better on screen than “one in ten,” but you can’t fake math. The book did have it's flaws, some repetitions and some dull moments , but just a few.If you like the subject….. read this book. "

Neil goes over some really interesting concepts, but they aren't what I would say for advanced readers. Much like his work on Cosmos, the concepts are simple but entertaining and informative. This is a book you could give to beginners who are just dipping their toes into astronomy, physics and earth space sciences. Like always, it's written in a warmer tone than say, Dawkins or Hitchens, and is even more accessible than Hawking although his works are written for the every day person as well. I wouldn't say this is for kids, but kids who are ""advanced"" in reading and sciences would get a kick out of this. I'd love to meet this guy one day.

to deny or erase the rich, colorful history of scientists and other thinkers who have invoked divinity in their work would be intellectually dishonest. surely there's an appropriate place for intelligent design to live in the academic landscape. how about the history of religion? how about philosophy or psychology? the one place it doesn't belong is the science classroom.if you're not swayed by academic arguments, consider the financial consequences. allow intelligent design into science textbooks, lecture halls, and laboratories, and the cost to the frontier of scientific discovery - the frontier that drives the economies of the future - would be incalculable. i don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed and therefore beyond their intellectual capacity. the day that happens, americans will just sit in awe of what we don't understand, while we watch the rest of the world boldly go where no mortal has gone before.

Not only does he describe what is happening in science, he describes the edges very well. By edges I mean the places where scientists are not sure what is happening and are actively searching for answers. That is always the most interesting part of any science. The problem today is that to get to that edge, you have to take years of schooling to understand what they are looking for. Once the edge could be explored in your home lab or a field (if you were Benjamin Franklin) now you need millions of dollars and a space telescope.The book is a bit repetitive, though that often happens with collections of essays because each one had to be self contained and couldn't refer to last month's issue. There has been a bit of editing to smooth out the sequencing and to make it an easier read.While I enjoyed all the essays, I took exception to the last one, entitled, The Perimeter of Ignorance. Here is the author's basic premise, Writing in centuries past, many scientists felt compelled to wax poetic about cosmic mysteries and God's handiwork. Perhaps one should not be surprised at this: most scientists back then, as well as many scientists today, identify themselves as spiritually devout. But a careful reading of older texts, particularly those concerned with the universe itself, shows that the authors invoke divinity only when they reach the boundaries of their understanding. They appeal to a higher power only when staring at the ocean of their own ignorance. They call on God only from the lonely and precarious edge of incomprehension. Where they feel certain about their explanations, however, God hardly gets a mention.He goes on from this hypothesis to give some quotes from Newton and other scientists, who do indeed see an explanation for the unexplainable in the presence of God. He then links this tendency to the current vogue for intelligent design. That also follows, more or less. I have my own issues with intelligent design, at least how it is being explained and used in the public sphere, but I won't go into all that here. The problem I have is that the author considers an appeal to deity as an admission of failure and the mental equivalent of throwing up your hands and saying, ""Heck if I know, only God could figure that out, I will just go find something easier to study, like Paris Hilton."" He says, in talking about intelligent design and the dangers of it, I don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed and therefore beyond their intellectual capacity.Since when is saying something is divinely designed the same as saying we are not capable of understanding it? As a devout person, but one who would have been a scientist, if not for a few chance decisions and a problem with basic arithmetic, I find everything divinely inspired, even those things we do understand. Too many people equate religion with ignorance, without considering the fact that the intelligent people who believe, must have a valid reason for doing so. And similarly, there are many ignorant people who have no religion. I cringe whenever a particularly proud, ignorant and Christian person is on the news saying something stupid because that just reinforces this ignorance=religion stereotype. I'm here to say intelligence=true religion. Believing in ignorance is just superstition whatever belief it may be. The more you understand your own beliefs, the more you want to learn. Our brains are designed to increase in knowledge, anything that does that helps all of us, no matter what the information may be."
80,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,3,"DEATH BY BLACK HOLE AND OTHER COSMIC QUANDARIES BY NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: An astrophysicist for the American Museum of Natural History, director of the world famous Hayden Planetarium, and columnist for Natural History magazine, Neil DeGrasse Tyson brings to the non-scientific world the ideal book for those fascinated with space, the cosmos, black holes, and all the questions and wonders therein. Death by Black Hole is the perfect book for the reader who wants answers to questions about the universe in a simple and clearly defined way so that even if they know next to nothing about science and it’s jargon, Tyson makes it easily understandable.While I was hoping for something a little more in depth in the style of Brian Greene’s The Fabric of the Cosmos or Lee Smolin’s The Trouble With Physics, Death by Black Hole nevertheless provides quick and simple answers to many questions everyday readers without a science background have about physics, the universe, space, and most matters dealing with the cosmos. The book is a selection of his columns in Natural History that are organized in a somewhat textbook fashion. Tyson starts with the idea of science and nature in its basic form, how humanity views Earth, the solar system, the universe. Along with this discussion, Tyson also gives minor history lessons on the development of different ideas in physics and astronomy, what people came up with what big ideas and how the progression led to the development of the big theories of our current time with string theory and relativity. Going on from here, Death by Black Hole address the crucial steps that led to the formation of the universe and its development over the many billions and billions of years, again explaining how it is that scientists know what they do and what instruments were used, as well as the history of who invented and used said instruments.It is then that Tyson finally turns to the subject matter of the title of the book in the section “When the Universe Turns Bad: All the Ways the Cosmos Wants to Kill Us.” Here he addresses the complex and still relatively unknown subjects of chaos theory, dark matter (which constitutes over 90% of all matter in the universe, while we still know next to nothing about it), and finally black holes. Tyson takes the reader on a hypothetical journey with what would happen if one were to be sucked into a black hole and how as they approached the event horizon, they would become stretched until the elasticity point of their skin was surpassed and the body would be torn into thousands then millions of little pieces.With many questions now answered, in the next section Tyson discusses how science is viewed by the media, Hollywood, and people around the world in general. The final section addresses the concept of science and religion, again taking the reader on a historic journey through the development of first religion, then science, and the struggle that has ensued for centuries. It is the perfect end to a book on science, as Tyson lectures the importance of supporting fact and reality in a time when there are many who believe more in faith, even when all the evidence is to the contrary.For more book reviews, and author interviews, go to BookBanter."
81,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558652-emma-sea,3,"My main dissatisfaction with this book is that it's a series of collected magazine columns. This does seem a bit like criticising an apple because it's not a banana, however I think Tyson would have be been better advised to hire an editor to whip this into an actual book, rather than just reprint the original short essays. For example, in chapter 25 Tyson critiques the concept of the ""Goldilocks Zone"", discussing the myriad ways life could flourish in environments entirely dissimilar to our own e.g. in seas of liquid ammonia or methane. But then in the following chapter Tyson contends that life will only originate on a planet with a temperature that allows liquid water i.e. in the Goldilocks Zone. Originally these essays would have been published months or years apart, but juxtaposed like this it is a frustrating read, to say the least.The other problem with short essays is that things just start to get interesting and it's over. In chapter 21 Tyson briefly mentions technetium; an element with a half-life of only 2 million years, but which is nevertheless found in red giant stars. ""In other words, the star cannot have been born with the stuff, for if it were there would be none left by now. There is also no known mechanism to create technetium in a star's core and have it dredge itself up to the surface where it is observed, which has led to exotic theories that have yet to achieve consensus in the astrophysics community""But you know, those diverse and exotic theories are exactly what I'd like to hear about! That was the most interesting part of the book for me, and it just gets left lying gasping on the floor.Also, sadly, the book is aimed at someone who has done little or no prior science reading; a far broader generalist audience that I hoped for. I 100% agree with Maria's review, when she says this would be a good high-school-level book. If you don't generally read pop-science, but would like to learn more about how our universe works, I definitely recommend this book. Tyson is a great writer: engaging and able to explain complex ideas simply, with a dash of humour.For me it's a 2.5, rounded up."
82,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2593734-nicholas-armstrong,2,"I can already see the masses of Tyson fans charging ahead just to light me aflame for having the audicity to doubt a word he says, but so I must. To be fair, I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. I saw him speak at USC, I've watched his lectures and his interviews, and I think he has done more for popularizing science than anyone else. But none of that a writer makes. This is especially true of sarcastic and sardonic wit. Being funny in text is what I would rate as the most challenging things to accomplish (some comics may agree) because it loses so much of the presence, tone, and body language that makes something funny. Tyson is a legitimately funny person, I promise this, but aside from the knowledge that he wrote this, none of that translates well. I could guess that this is because much of his humor is in his intonations, pauses, and timing, something any classclown can tell you about. But not any classclown can write a best-selling comedic novel, nor can just any astro-physicist write a truly comic novel, or at least one which transfers that genius.What I'm getting at is that this book is dry. It seeks to inform, but it does so in a way that is just a little bit uninteresting and just a little bit reminscent of my astronomy courses. Interesting stuff, but the delivery was just all wrong.This wasn't assisted by the fact that the structuring of the book is terrible. To be fair, Tyson admits at the outset that this is little more than a collection of essays slapped back to back and tidied up a bit to try and make them fit, but that is exactly how they read. The transitions are generally poor and always jarring. The sentences don't blend together so much as float like an oily film, and trying to read too many consectutive pieces put together makes me feel as if my brain were a poorly done game of tetris - too many holes and not enough matching lines.But hey, I'm for anything that gets people reading, and I'm especially for anything that gets people reading about the world and about science. It goes without saying that I'm far happier this book is out there and so widely read than never having been published. I just prattle on because I'm a snot-nose with too many standards."
83,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5495893-leana-m,5,Well written and great stuff for the universe geek (or anyone with the slightest interest and curiosity for learning). NDT adds some fun with his quirks and humor. Allow me to indulge in a little pun here- And it ends with a bang. ;) 
84,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6071693-dale-jr,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson has become a bit of an inspiration and scientific hero to me. He's a man who strongly pushes forth to erase scientific ignorance and champions the exploration of our world and the universe to further human greatness.His lectures are intensely interesting and full of scientific knowledge, yet easy to follow by anyone willing to listen and apply their minds. He boils down some of the most complex theories and scientific facts so that they're easily understood. His writing is no different.I've been diving further and further into astrophysics and varying theories in related fields (string and multiverse theory is, simply put, awesome). This journey has made me quite familiar with Tyson and I figured it was about time to pick up one of his texts.Death by Black Hole is a collection of essays and lectures spanning the entire field of astrophysics and cosmology. From the Big Bang, to the life cycles of stars. From the speed of light to the mind-boggling power of black holes. There's even a section where Tyson describes the three biggest ways our world will come to an end. And it has nothing to do with ancient Mayan prophecy or the second coming.When scientifically investigating the natural world the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier.Since it is a collection of various lectures and essays, some information is repeated here and there, but it does not detract from the wealth of knowledge contained between the covers. I learned a lot. Retained most of it in one reading due to Tyson's way of writing and explaining. This is a book full of information, yet you never feel like your reading something as dry as a text book. Tyson makes you want to keep reading. He injects humor along with serious scientific education.I'm glad that his book lived up to my expectations of him and I will be sure to pick up his others. Quite frankly, this was the best non-fiction book I've read this year. Wonderfully executed and easily devoured. I feel both filled with new knowledge, and humbled by the amount I, and the rest of my human brothers and sisters, do not know yet.But as Tyson lays out in his book, it's not wrong to be ignorant of something as long as you are continuing to try and figure it out.Science is a philosophy of discovery. Intelligent design is a philosophy of ignorance. You cannot build a program of discovery on the assumption that nobody is smart enough to figure out the answer to the problem. Once upon a time, people identified the god Neptune as the source of storms at sea. Today we call these storms hurricanes. We know when and where they start. We know what drives them. We know what mitigates their destructive power. And anyone who has studied global warming can tell you what makes them worse. The only people who still call hurricanes ""acts of God"" are the people who write insurance forms."
85,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96664-samantha,4,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. His humor and straightforwardness were some of the best things about the History Channel documentary, The Universe. And his lectures on YouTube are always extremely inventive, interesting, and entertaining. So when I saw this book on the shelf at my local bookstore, I had to buy it.I wasn't disappointed.Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed learning about the universe. I'll never be an astrophysicist, but it always fascinates me to learn about all that's out there (and all that may be out there that we have yet to discover). Of course, the language of the cosmos is complicated: nebulae, pulsars, quasars, supernovas, black holes, event horizons, dark matter, antimatter, etc., etc.That's where Dr. Tyson comes in. He has an uncanny ability to take something that is unfailingly complex to the 'average' person such as myself and explain it in a way that I can understand. And he does so with unsurpassed humor, wit, and even the slightest bit of self-deprecation.In the end, he says, the universe is out to kill us. In many, many ways. And even though there is a lot we still don't understand about the universe and how it began and where it's going, that doesn't mean we stop looking. There is always more to learn, there is always more to discover, and if the essays in his book are any indication, it is all utterly fascinating.The last part of the book deals with science and religion. Dr. Tyson claims that being a scientist doesn't necessarily preclude belief in God. However, he staunchly claims that God has no business in scientific discovery, that simply crediting God with creating all the things that science can't currently explain opens the door to the cessation of scientific discovery. He quotes Galileo, who said, ""I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.""If the science vs. God debate makes you uncomfortable, have no fear--it's a very small part of the book, tucked in at the very end after all the terrific science essays.I highly recommend this book, even if you're only slightly interested in the universe. "
86,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2751053-bakari,5,"Astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson‘s Death By Black Hole is definitely an engaging read, especially for these modern times. Though many pages and chapters about the particulars of matter, energy, space, and time—the physics of the universe—were very difficult for my scientifically illiterate mind to comprehend, I read nearly ever page for nuggets of understanding. Tyson is a excellent writer because he knows his subject matter. Just think how different our Bible reading population would be if Tyson had wrote the Book of Genesis. His “in the beginning“ would have probably talked about the discoveries and meaning of supernovas, as the “primary source for the origin and relative mix of heavy elements in the universe.” He would have verses about Newton’s laws of motion and early twentieth century theories about quantum mechanics. His creation story would not be described in a mere seven days; his story would talk about billions of years—more time than most of us can imagine. But of course, the Bible was written in an era which lacked the scientific discoveries that Tyson writes about. But, but...this is what makes Death By Black Hole, and other books similar to it, so important. Reading a book like this provides us more knowledge about the universe and who we are as homo sapiens than Biblical writers could ever imagine. We simply need the education, patience, and study to learn what has been discovered. Though we are not, as Tyson writes in his essay, “Fear of Numbers,” “wired for logical thinking,” the brain, as he goes on to say, is “a marvelously flexible organ.” And in my view it’s time that more and more of us start using our brain to its greatest potential. Believing and praying to gods and reading horoscopes are no longer sufficient for our survival as a species. We can do much, much better than that.Perhaps a few months from now, I’ll read another of Tyson‘s books, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution, and view the PBS companion special as I do. It will be much like viewing the Carl Sagan’s Cosmos back in my college days. "
87,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4826452-evan-wondrasek,5,"Death by Black Hole is one of the most interesting non-fiction science books I've ever read. It's a collection of essays published by Neil deGrasse Tyson over the last 10+ years, and provides great, down-to-earth explanations of amazing astrophysics phenomena. This isn't a book about farfetched scenarios as its title implies - only a single chapter was actually about ""death by black hole"" - but the rest of the book presented a thorough and highly scientific explanation of the universe as we know it.Being that this book wasn't written as one cohesive text (it's a summary of essays as I mentioned), there is some informational overlap between the chapters. You'll be introduced to people like Galileo, Keppler, and Huygens more than once. I didn't mind at all, and I thought the overlap helped me solidify information.My favorite part of this book the crazy facts about celestial scale it presented. For example, the book states that a photon of light takes something like 500 seconds to go from the Sun's surface to the surface of earth; conversely, that same photon took upwards of 100,000 years to go from the Sun's core to the Sun's surface. Read the book and you'll learn why :)"
88,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3110398-sean,4,"I feel that the reason that people do not understand science in the US today is because we have a foolish tradition of thinking that the only way to ""know"" physics is through the terse formalism of mathematics. Math is a tool to do science, as much as a microscope or a superconducting supercollider. The disservice we do as scientists are when we are unable to communicate the concepts about our physical world to the population at large because we tangle ourselves up in mathematical formalism.Neil DeGrasse Tyson will never have that criticism hurled against him.It is in the tradition of Sagan, Gribbin and Hawking that Tyson writes and his essays are pure delight, discussing the concepts of physics as though he was having a casual coffee talk. It makes science fun. Yes your brain will come alive, but for a basic understanding of our physical world, this book should be read and I can't wait to read another by him.I even learned that laser spectroscopists and chemists label the same energy transitions differently. Awesome."
89,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4983144-colleen,4,"This is a great introduction into the world of astrophysics for the lay person. It's funny and engaging in a way you couldn't imagine a book about astrophysics being (without reading this book). How did it all begin and where are we going are just some of the cosmic quandaries that are tackled. It even has a whole section on how many ways the planet and its life could end! Fun stuff for a nerd like me. Plus, it touches on many other science/culture conundrums that are great food for thought. It was a tiny redundant, owing to the fact that these are all previously written essays collected for purpose of the book. But, I actually liked the redundancy. It allowed more time for the heavy science behind astrophysics to sink in, and I became more familiar with the scientists that propelled our cosmic knowledge forward. Overall, it was a great read. It was a refreshing break from the day-to-day politics and tedium that can make our lives feel very small. From the advantage of science, it truly put our Earthly lives into a cosmic perspective."
90,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a force to reckon with. But he is not Carl Sagan. While Sagan must have smiled down kindly on your meek acknowledgement of ignorance regarding, say, black holes, Tyson will have most probably given you the stink eye or aimed a sarcastic jibe at your apathy, before proceeding to explain why black holes still remain a topic of much speculation in the community of astrophysicists worldwide.Tyson does not pull any punches in this collection of essays while slamming the news media, who more often than not, come off as ill-informed hacks doing a shoddy job of reporting facts in the field of space science, forever (stupidly) claiming how scientists are baffled by so-and-so new developments. 
""Scientists cannot claim to be on the research frontier unless one thing or another baffles them. Bafflement drives discovery.""
Or snidely commenting on the Hollywood exercise of producing multi-million dollar sci-fi films which badly butcher the scientific aspects of such ventures by inserting factually incorrect observations in scenes and dialogues. (there's a brilliant anecdote concerning James Cameron's 'Titanic' in this regard and the Contact film gets an honorable mention for its adherence to proper science if one overlooks a minor gaffe)
""I am glad that, in the end, the humans win. We conquer the 'Independence Day' aliens by having a Macintosh laptop computer upload a software virus to the mothership. [] The entire defense system for the alien mothership must have been powered by the same release of Apple Computer's system software as the laptop computer that delivered the virus.""
Or criticizing the mad dash for extending the frontiers of space science during the Cold war years, when the spirit of scientific inquiry was sidelined in favor of a dangerous game of political one-upmanship, a kind of puerile assertion of 'our scientists are better than yours'. Or openly chastising revered names from ancient Greece like Aristotle whose inaccurate assumptions about the unchanging nature of stars and the geocentric universe helped the Catholic Church in propagating falsities for centuries with impunity. (He doesn't even spare Newton for God's Higgs Boson's sake who, unable to satisfactorily explain the ordered behavior of the solar system despite the many often conflicting gravitational forces at work, had cited God's need to step in to correct things in his famed 'Principia')While Sagan may have adopted a more benign, less aggressive tone in course of addressing issues of religious dogma being at loggerheads with scientific reasoning and aversion to science and mathematics among the general populace, NDT takes the approach of pure, unadulterated logic and demolishes one popular misconception after another (for e.g.:-the North Star is not the most brilliant star in the night sky or how everything that goes up doesn't come down) with a brute force which I am certain will not sit well with some sensitive readers who are easily offended. Being born in a country whose space research organization head performs pujas and makes ritualistic offerings prior to launching a 'Mission to Mars', I can't say I fault NDT's acerbic tone or his distaste for those who are hell-bent on unifying science and religion without even realizing that finding common ground between both is akin to attempting to exceed the velocity of light. But if NDT lacks Sagan's sage-like demeanour and his rich, authorial voice (Sagan's prose is much more refined no doubt), his excellent sense of humor almost compensates for their absence - 
""The good thing about the laws of physics is that they require no law enforcement agencies to maintain them, although I once owned a nerdy T-shirt that loudly proclaimed, ""OBEY GRAVITY.""

""The only people who still call hurricanes 'acts of God' are the people who write insurance forms.""
(and Michele Bachmann, just saying)And occasionally there's a sop thrown in for the literary-minded (particularly the postmodernist fiction lover) - ""The physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who in 1964 proposed the existence of quarks, and who at the time thought the quark family had only three members, drew the name from a characteristically elusive line in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake: 'Three quarks for Muster Mark!'""
The more frivolous aspects of the essays aside, among the astrophysics-related topics NDT centers his discussions around, the ones which were relatively new to me are the concepts of hypernovae, gamma ray bursts, dark matter and dark energy, the uncertainty surrounding the string theory and the probability of the annihilation of Earth through ill-fated, cosmic encounters with errant asteroids, the unavoidable, impending collision of our galaxy with the Andromeda galaxy which is the nearest one heading towards us at a speed of more than 100 kilometers per second.The Andromeda GalaxySince this is a collection of 42 essays which were published in the 'Natural History' magazine, some repetition of concepts and names creeps in occasionally but that merely helps you refresh memories of what you just read a few pages back, not exactly a shortcoming I am keen to quibble over. 4 stars, because Tyson seems a little too bitter about artists who exercise 'artistic license' to distort certain astronomical facts in their paintings. Besides I am certain there is a lot of 5-star-worthy goodness in the rest of NDT's works left for me to discover in the future."
91,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"This is a very fun read for all you science nerds... not only being clear and humorous but wide-ranging and careful to build up a number of those necessary building blocks of knowledge but doing it precisely in order to slam you with the good stuff later.Like how you'd DIE IN A BLACK HOLE... :)To belabor the obvious by the title. :)Seriously, this book gives us a ton of great ways to die and not just by black hole. I really appreciated that. :)I'd characterize this book as an easy to intermediate stage science book that's very far from being dull and it has a minimum of equations. I'm sure everyone has heard of thermodynamics and E=MC squared and Drake's equation, after all, but what really thrilled me about this was the truly wide array of subjects and Tyson's conversational tone.You can tell he is still a very, very good science teacher. :)I can almost hear him say, ""Let's throw out the crap, folks, let's dive right into the good stuff."" And he does, ranging from the Big Bang to the Heat Death, kinds of possible life on planets, the building blocks we need to understand science, including a great ""stick"" analogy for understanding the universe without computers, and he even gets into a bit of politics and religion because let's face it: it's a hot discussion item. But thankfully, it's only there as an afterthought.I wanted science and I got science, exploring the planets, the sun, even quasars, and especially Black Holes. That's the yummy stuff, after all.  10/10 Black Holes agree! Nom nom nom nom nom. I totally recommend this for both laymen and the intelligently curious and for anyone else who just likes a bit of the good (science) life. It really, really helps that Tyson's a great writer and clear as glass. The light passes right through it without slowing down at all! Can you believe it?"
92,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70078-chloe,4,"Within my skull, where all of those vital pieces of data surrounding science are supposed to be stored, there is instead a vast beaker-shaped void of ignorance. In high school, while we were supposed to be studying the musculature of the formaldehyde-soaked amphibians pinned ignominiously to their coffinesque metal trays, I was far more interested in studying the effects of adding fire to small green buds. During my brief time wandering the hallways of the University world, I was able to do away with my prerequisite requirement by taking an “Arts of Science” course tailor-made for those more interested in empathy than entropy and, while I did manage to get a crocodile on my report card, all I took away from that class was an abiding hatred for hippies. The long and the short of all this is that I didn’t know a quasar from a neutron or a brown dwarf from a red giant (though Red Dwarf was a magnificent television series).As a devout lover of science fiction and hi-tech gadgetry of all sorts, this was a matter of not a little shame for me. To resolve this I decided that it was time for me to fill in some of the (immense) gaps in my education the best way I know how- via book. Yet how to avoid having my eyes glaze over the moment someone started explaining cell structures or complex wave fields? Fortunately, as it often does, my television provided a solution when Stephen Colbert took a visit to the American Museum of Natural Historys Hayden Planetarium and spoke with its Director, Neil deGrasse Tyson. Tyson, while just as geeky as you would expect from an astrophysicist, is phenomenally skilled at taking incredibly complex scientific theories and translating them into a Common English that even Stephen Colbert is able to understand. My fate was sealed. This man was the ideal author to ease myself into the brave new world of stellar science.Death by Black Hole is a collection of essays the Tyson penned for Natural History magazine over the course of several years. Each essay addresses a different topic, running the gamut from the birth of the universe, the history of astronomical discoveries, humankind’s fixation on the red hills of Mars and the life-bringing water that may lay frozen away, all the way to the Pluto Wars (it’s amazing just how contentious Pluto’s status as planet is). Of course there’s some overlap between the chapters and some facts get repeated but, rather than bugging me, I found it to be a good refresher of what had come before that helped solidify my basic understanding of the concepts at hand. Most interesting to me, policy junkie that I am, is the closing essay in which Tyson writes about the plague of scientific ignorance sweeping the country. After almost brutally doing away with that Bible-in-textbook-clothing anachronism that is “intelligent design,” he makes great points about America’s waning prestige in scientific research and the future costs, both economic and academic, that we will have to pay due to ceding our intellectual priority to advance knowledge. I’m not much interested in sustaining American supremacy in any field, but I can always get behind an argument for strengthening education.What I most enjoyed was the excitement that Tyson has for his field. He doesn’t get bogged down in the minutiae of atomic weights and the like, but thrills at the possibilities of quantum mechanics and takes an almost excessive amount of joy in ruminating over the possible ways that people can be killed in space from the atom-splitting nullification of crossing a black hole’s event horizon to the persistent fear of a species-leveling asteroid striking Earth. Tyson is a man possessed of a childlike sense of wonder at the mysteries of the universe that sees the current limits of our scientific understanding not as having reached the final frontiers of science but as hurdles to be vaulted over in our quest to know. His enthusiasm is quite contagious and I challenge any reader to emerge from this book without being excited about science."
93,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"I have often lamented the passing of my favorite popular scientist, Carl Sagan, by talking about how necessary he is right now. We are at a point in our history where scientific illiteracy is growing, where people are not only ignorant of how science works, but are proud of their ignorance. What we need is someone who can reach the majority of Americans who are not especially scientifically literate - the people whose automatic reaction to science is to think, ""That's just too hard for me to deal with.""Enter Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and the director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. He's appeared on countless television programs, including The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, to talk about the current state of astronomy and astrophysics. He's an engaging and entertaining man, who claims that Pluto was ""asking for"" its demotion, who seems to take perverse pleasure in describing all the terrible ways the universe could take us out. He knows that we're in a precarious position, here on Earth, and he revels in it rather than worrying about it. Whereas Sagan seemed to come from the point of view that the universe was a place of infinite wonder, where one could look anywhere and be awed and humbled, Tyson's attitude is more of the universe as an infinite theme park - a place where you could see your electrons stripped from your body, watch gas clouds larger than our own solar system collide and ignite, or see planets crumple under cosmic bombardment. Tyson's universe is an adventure, as big as it gets.This book is a collection of essays that Tyson wrote for Natural History magazine over a ten year period, on a variety of subjects related to science and scientific inquiry. In many ways, it's similar to every other pop science book out there - and there are so very many of them - but it is his perspective and his voice that makes this one stand out from the crowd.He's grouped his essays into seven sections, on topics ranging from the difficulties inherent in actually knowing anything about the universe to the understanding of how life went from little mindless bacteria to we clever Homo sapiens to the intersection of science and religion. Most of it is accessible to the average non-scientist, though he does get a little technical at points. But he understands that, and he tries to compensate for for the fact that, by and large, the public is intimidated by ""real science."" In the essay entitled, ""Over the Rainbow,"" he discusses this particular challenge by using spectroscopy as an example.In spectroscopy, astrophysicists look at the spectrum of a star, hunting for telltale dark lines that indicate the physical properties of stars. It's like looking at a rainbow with bits blackened out of it, as though the CIA had somehow gotten to it first. Those black lines contain all the vital information about the star's composition and, more importantly, speed. Very little can be gleaned by just looking at the star, as it turns out. He notes five levels of abstraction, starting from the star itself:Level 0: A starLevel 1: Picture of a starLevel 2: Light from the picture of a starLevel 3: Spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.Level 4: Patterns of lines lacing the spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.Level 5: Shifts in the patterns of lines in the spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.These descending levels of abstraction can apply to any branch of science, not just astrophysics. The challenge, as he notes, is getting people past level 1, which is easy to understand but is not the level at which true science is done. It is up to educators, he says, to help make people comfortable with looking at real science, and not just pretty pictures.Indeed, there are several sections of the book dedicated to the intersection between science and the public. He talks about how easily we are baffled by numbers (why are below-ground floors not labeled -1, -2, -3 etc?) and how casually we disregard actual scientific facts. He brings up some of his favorite moments in bad movie science, and how he single-handedly saved Titanic from ignominious astronomical shame. At least, on its DVD re-release. He addresses the historically shifting centers of science in human history, how things like NASA are truly a global endeavor. Without the discoveries made through history by people all over the planet - from England to Greece to Baghdad - there would be no NASA, nor any science that we recognize. And to assume that the United States will always be the center of scientific discovery is to willfully ignore history.And, of course, there's a section dedicated to the conflict between religion and science, a never-ending battle that has existed since science began. Tyson believes that there can be no common ground between the two - science relies on facts, religion relies on faith. This is not to say that one is better than the other, any more than, say, a hammer is better than a screwdriver. It's just that you can't use them interchangeably. And he points out that becoming a scientist doesn't require you to give up your faith. There have been, and still are, countless scientists who are believers in the Divine. It's just that most of them know enough not to confuse science and spirituality. The place where they meet, historically, is on the boundary of ignorance. Isaac Newton, having figured out gravity, couldn't quite work out how you could have a multiple-body system like our solar system without the whole thing falling into chaos. His conclusion - God must, from time to time, step in to keep things on the right path. Having done that, Newton went on to do other things, and it wasn't until the next century that Pierre-Simon laPlace decided that he wasn't satisfied with Newton's ""Insert God Here"" argument, and did the math for himself.In other words, God is a marker on the boundaries of ignorance, and the best of us are tempted to let Him answer the questions that we can't. To do so, however, impedes the path of science and stops progress in its tracks. What if Newton had said, ""No, I'm going to figure this damn thing out."" Would we be a century ahead in our technology by now? Maybe, maybe not. What if the Catholic Church had listened when Galileo said, ""The Bible tells you how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."" Might more progress have been made? So many great thinkers have come up to the boundaries of their knowledge and, humbled by what they do not know, chose to allow The God of the Gaps reassure them.But that's the whole point of science, and it's what this book, and others like it, are trying to instill in people. The unknown is not horrible, it is not terrifying, and it's not a place to just stop. It's a place of awe and wonder and bafflement and opportunity. To say, ""I don't understand it - it must be God"" is short-changing ourselves and our heirs out of even greater knowledge of the universe."
94,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392197-jocelyn,5,"I don't think I can properly explain how much I love this book, but I'll try.Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries is a collection of essays Tyson wrote for Natural History, a magazine dedicated to -- you guessed it -- natural history (basically, science) between 1995-2005.What I like about it:- Tyson writes in a way that's easily accessible for anyone even without a science background. His analogies are easy to understand and they're fun. Like, ""Oh, Neil deGrasse Tyson, you."" Also, he tries to explain complex terms or theories so that you can finish the book and be a pseudo-astrophysicist. Now you can go to dinner parties and impress people with your knowledge about quarks and black holes and radio waves.- Tyson's writing is jovial and light-hearted. He frequently cracks jokes to lighten the mood -- you don't want to be bored. (Of course, I am a huge physics nerd and he could drone on and on about string theory and it could never bore me.) At one point, he jokes about red shirts. Red shirts, people! This guy's a winner.- Tyson takes the time to highlight two ways science (broadly) and astro-/physics (specifically) relate to both theology and culture. The Science and Culture section of the book was interesting, because what he describes is true: there is a misunderstanding between what scientists are doing and what the public thinks the scientists are doing. His little asides (rants) are fun, too.- This was a very informative book for just being a collection of 5-10 page essays. If you're new to astrophysics, the universe and particles, this stuff is like gold -- I don't think I've seen/heard any of the phenomena explained in a clearer way. If you're not new to any of this, then you probably shouldn't be reading this because you've probably already read it. Unless you really like it.Issues for some people, but weren't issues for me:- I understand that some people may go, ""Ugh, why does everything that has to do with science bring up religion and God!"" Tyson does dedicate a whole section of the book to (omg) 3 essays dealing with religion's place in science. He does so tactfully and tastefully. I'm not a religious person, but I don't think he would have offended anyone. And besides, religion and science have been at each others' throats since the dawn of both. If a popular astrophysicist didn't bring it up, someone would have asked why he didn't bring it up.- There's some repetition going on because, if you've read the preface and my review you'll know, this is a collection of essays from a magazine. There's bound to be some repetition because non-sciencey readers need to be reminded that Planck is considered the father of quantum mechanics and that Einstein's theory of relativity is a furthering of Newton's theory of gravity. Honestly, the repetition isn't enough where you would roll your eyes and mutter, ""Redundant.""- Some people may not be okay with Tyson's little rants. In one part he complains about the scientific ignorance going on in Hollywood skylines. Some readers may just want him to stop complaining and shut up already, but he has a right to his discontent. When you're a professional in your field, things that are obviously wrong annoy you more than those that don't belong to your field. You should see how irritated my family gets when I point out the inconsistencies movies have in regards to language and sociolinguistic situations. His annoyance is justified.Basically, what this all boils down to is this:How can you not like a man who dresses in a waistcoat with suns and stars on it?How can you not like a man whose reaction to Newton became a meme?Seriously, though, this book is awesome."
95,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309472-maria,3,"I have one last section to go (Religion and Science), but my main points won't be affected by it.Death By Black Hole provides, especially in the first couple of sections, a really good outline of various problems that astrophysicists are confronted with, and it definitely made me think of the scientific process in a new way. So that was pretty cool. But on the whole, my reaction was rather meh - kind of disappointing when the book really isn't bad. My main complaint about the book isn't actually the book's fault. It's just way below my level, and I found myself frequently bored. I think the best audience for the book is someone who's never had an astronomy class, and is maybe familiar with basic physics and chemistry. I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I read it in high school. I did learn a handful of new things, and sometimes Tyson's explanations helped some points I was fuzzy on click into place, but on the whole, I would have preferred the book to be much more detailed.My second problem is that, as Tyson says in the preface, the book is composed of various essays that he wrote for a magazine over the years, and that they were only slightly edited for continuity when he was preparing the book. Big mistake. While this divided the book into bite-sized, easy to process pieces, it also made it a helluva lot repetitive. Several phenomena were explained two, or even three times throughout the book. It should really have been edited a lot more aggressively.But on the whole, I think this is a really good pick for a layperson who doesn't know much about astronomy and isn't interested in involved explanations of the physical and chemical side of things. Neil deGrasse Tyson is one eloquent guy, and writes with an infectious passion for his subject. "
96,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"As a scientist, at first I was rather bored by this book. I was not learning anything new, and not gaining new insights into astronomy.But, as I read further, it just hit me--this book is tremendously entertaining! If you are a layman, and looking for a unique viewpoint, you could do a lot worse than this book. And, believe it or not, you will be entertained!In addition, Tyson puts several aspects of astronomy and astrophysics into a unique perspective. He describes all the ways that the universe is trying to kill us--storms, viruses, meteors, comets, climate change, volcanoes, and so on. But many of these lethal phenomena could be responsible for life existing on Earth, in the first place!I really did appreciate the arguments put forward against the idea of ""Intelligent Design."" Just because some areas in cosmology are not understood, does not mean that one is required to invoke God as a cause. Science always works on the frontier of knowledge, and if we were always to state that God is responsible for things we do not yet understand, then we would be working on the frontier of ignorance. Tyson does a much better job than I can, in explaining this concept. Highly recommended!"
97,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,4,"Neil is without doubt one of the greatest scientific communicators alive. He is erudite and hilarious with no apparent effort and can always bring the 'wow'.I enjoy his podcast and have probably watched near all videos on youtube that feature him. This is the first time that I have tried his written work and I am very pleased with the results.This work is a collection of editorial pieces that Neil writes for a periodical. They are intended to be short, punchy scientific stories and not form an ongoing dialogue.In this respect Neil did a brilliant job. I dipped in and out of this book over the last couple of weeks and it was simple to pick up again after each break. I read it while doing experiments in the lab, and I read it while on the toilet.What let the collection down (just the tiniest smidgen) was that some material was covered twice. Fine for an ongoing column and understandable for a collection, but still, a little work could have been taken to cull and back reference sections.Don't get me wrong, I adored this book. And anyone who has not discovered love for Neil needs to read it immediately. You'll definitely connect with him if you are sceptical, scientific or just a spotter of bullshit.This book left me wanting more. I want some long form stories, woven into a larger narrative. I have 'The Pluto Files' on my shelf. Maybe it won't be long before I open it."

I also find science fascinating. I'm just not sure what happen between me and Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries.....Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for a science-y book. Maybe I over estimated my intelligence. Both are quite possible. The whole time I was listening to this, it was like listening to Charlie Browns teacher. whaa wha whaa wha whaa Galileo, wha wha E=mc2, whaa whaa whaa Gravity sucks.I would get some really good, crunchy tidbit and be riveted.....and then the mind would drift to something like ""I wonder if I fed the cats, and CRAP I forgot to start the dishwasher""........then I would drift back to the science stuff.It just didn't hold my attention."
99,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37690097-ahmed-r-rashwan,4,"So I have a thing for Black Holes, so what?! You knew that already! You didn't? Well now you do.I have had an obsession with Black Holes for as long as I can remember. It was perhaps one of the first phenomena of the big umbrella of Astronomy and Cosmology that I was introduced to and I immediately fell in love with; I mean what is there not to love. An equal or even grander obsession is awarded of course to the author of this brilliant book.Of course, as with almost all scientific books, the title is pretty elusive. Yes, there was talk of Black Holes, a lot of talk, but there was a slew of other cosmological subjects too! But, of course, you will hear absolutely no complaints from me. As my favourite astronomer, I am inspired by Neil deGrasse Tyson much in the same way he was probably inspired by Carl Sagan.There is probably no other human beings on this planet that have invested more to the field of astronomy like Sagan and Tyson have. I, of course, do not mean this in a scientific sense but a commercial one. Sagan and Tyson are to Astronomy what Bill Nye is to Science.So for all intends and purposes, this review is in fact a form of praising for Neil deGrasse Tyson and his meaning to me as a person rather than a review of the actual book. There are simply some people out there who's literary work is completely overshadowed by their contributions to the subject upon which they write about, so I will dismiss the small quantity of repetitiveness inherent in all scientific books (especially ones comprising of several essays).They tell you never to meet your heroes, that it is somehow inevitable to be disappointed by such an interaction; that the perfect image you have most definitely built of your heroes is most certainly to fall short of reality. But while I cannot claim to have met Neil deGrasse Tyson, I have at least had a closer glimpse to his personal opinions and thoughts. I shied away from this book for the longest time specifically for fear of being disappointed by the literary work of a person I probably hold the highest esteem of amongst all people.I don't even recall when or how I was first ""introduced"" to Neil but what followed was an obsession that has lasted years, till this day. I have probably watched his 'Cosmos' show, inspired by Carl Sagan's Cosmos up to at least 5 times. Neil is funny, witty, intelligent and very very charismatic. If it wasn't for him, there would have definitely been so many different aspects of astronomy that I wouldn't have particularly grabbed. His style of ""story-telling"" transports you back to a time when anything interested you, when your explorer genes were yet to be suppressed; just like you were a little kid again. So it comes as no surprise that I read the entire book imagining Neil was narrating it to me, for I had completely memorised his pattern of speech and voice, and it is equally not surprising that I would love any work, literary or otherwise that Neil produces.I ask nothing more of men of science, to be able to pass down the passion in the way that Neil has been very successful in doing is the calling for all of scientists, regardless of their field of study."

101,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1306562-josh,1,"For me this book was merely okay. I've read quite a bit of these types of books, physics for the layperson, and this book was probably my least favorite.I don't like the overall tone of the book. Tyson makes a point to belittle the human race as much as possible and he comes across as pessimistic. By no means do I think humans are the pinnacle of perfection, but I think we're doing pretty well.The content of the book was all over the place and only briefly touched on black holes and other cosmic quandaries. In fact the titular cosmological event, though an ""entire"" chapter, was hardly described while long tangents about minor events in historical figures' lives were expounded in detail.I don't recommend this book to any but those that are cursorily interested in cosmology. I recommend Hawking, Brian Greene or Amir Aczel."

If you're worried about what might happen to you if you inadvertently get a little, tinsy bit too close to a black hole of death! (even your atoms get pulled apart) then again, I might not read this book. Because, if you thought your ulcer was healing and you could eat salsa with your chips again. Think again! A collection of essays about a myriad of cosmic topics from Natural History magazine written by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson (you've probably seen him on PBS, and no he's not the night sky guy with the weird voice), this book entertains. Frightens. Enlightens. And inevitably makes you feel much, much smarter for reading it. But believe me, sometimes this knowledge is a scary, scary thing! In fact, now I'd like to take some of it back. Oh, brain atrophy!Except for a few about half way through that made my eyes start to glaze over, I found most of these essays really interesting and readable. Tyson is obviously one of those well known science professionals who is actually interested in, and good at, teaching (believe it or not!) instead of just doing research and publishing. So yes, they do exist..Way, oh way back in the dark ages when I was in college I took a series of physics classes from an astronaut named Don Lind. He was a cocky ass who said stuff like, if you ever get a chance to fly in space.. . I wanted to slap him...anyway, I remember learning about prisms and color and how our brain interprets it, and thinking that was the coolest thing! I remember telling my twelve year old sister about it, about how a prism works and why we are able to see that myriad of colors without moving our eyes (look it up, it's really cool!). She looked at me like I was a martian from outer space who'd just landed and interrupted an episode of Get Smart, and made fun of me for years because of it. Well, neiner neiner.

According to her numbers, that leaves 0.0000004 planets with intelligent life on them, which is a figure somewhat lower than “millions.” No doubt that “one in a million” sounds better on screen than “one in ten,” but you can’t fake math. The book did have it's flaws, some repetitions and some dull moments , but just a few.If you like the subject….. read this book. "

Neil goes over some really interesting concepts, but they aren't what I would say for advanced readers. Much like his work on Cosmos, the concepts are simple but entertaining and informative. This is a book you could give to beginners who are just dipping their toes into astronomy, physics and earth space sciences. Like always, it's written in a warmer tone than say, Dawkins or Hitchens, and is even more accessible than Hawking although his works are written for the every day person as well. I wouldn't say this is for kids, but kids who are ""advanced"" in reading and sciences would get a kick out of this. I'd love to meet this guy one day.

to deny or erase the rich, colorful history of scientists and other thinkers who have invoked divinity in their work would be intellectually dishonest. surely there's an appropriate place for intelligent design to live in the academic landscape. how about the history of religion? how about philosophy or psychology? the one place it doesn't belong is the science classroom.if you're not swayed by academic arguments, consider the financial consequences. allow intelligent design into science textbooks, lecture halls, and laboratories, and the cost to the frontier of scientific discovery - the frontier that drives the economies of the future - would be incalculable. i don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed and therefore beyond their intellectual capacity. the day that happens, americans will just sit in awe of what we don't understand, while we watch the rest of the world boldly go where no mortal has gone before.

Of course, this is the type of book I will almost always pick up from the library. It is a collection of essays on science for the magazine Natural History. It covers a wide range of topics, usually relating to physics, from particle physics to astrophysics. I love this stuff and I only wish I retained enough math to be able to read more technical discussions than these rather general essays.The essays are informative and entertaining. A lot has changed in the 17 years since I took my particle physics class at BYU, so I am always interested to learn more. Not only does he describe what is happening in science, he describes the edges very well. By edges I mean the places where scientists are not sure what is happening and are actively searching for answers. That is always the most interesting part of any science. The problem today is that to get to that edge, you have to take years of schooling to understand what they are looking for. Once the edge could be explored in your home lab or a field (if you were Benjamin Franklin) now you need millions of dollars and a space telescope.The book is a bit repetitive, though that often happens with collections of essays because each one had to be self contained and couldn't refer to last month's issue. There has been a bit of editing to smooth out the sequencing and to make it an easier read.While I enjoyed all the essays, I took exception to the last one, entitled, The Perimeter of Ignorance. Here is the author's basic premise, Writing in centuries past, many scientists felt compelled to wax poetic about cosmic mysteries and God's handiwork. Perhaps one should not be surprised at this: most scientists back then, as well as many scientists today, identify themselves as spiritually devout. But a careful reading of older texts, particularly those concerned with the universe itself, shows that the authors invoke divinity only when they reach the boundaries of their understanding. They appeal to a higher power only when staring at the ocean of their own ignorance. They call on God only from the lonely and precarious edge of incomprehension. Where they feel certain about their explanations, however, God hardly gets a mention.He goes on from this hypothesis to give some quotes from Newton and other scientists, who do indeed see an explanation for the unexplainable in the presence of God. He then links this tendency to the current vogue for intelligent design. That also follows, more or less. I have my own issues with intelligent design, at least how it is being explained and used in the public sphere, but I won't go into all that here. The problem I have is that the author considers an appeal to deity as an admission of failure and the mental equivalent of throwing up your hands and saying, ""Heck if I know, only God could figure that out, I will just go find something easier to study, like Paris Hilton."" He says, in talking about intelligent design and the dangers of it, I don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed and therefore beyond their intellectual capacity.Since when is saying something is divinely designed the same as saying we are not capable of understanding it? As a devout person, but one who would have been a scientist, if not for a few chance decisions and a problem with basic arithmetic, I find everything divinely inspired, even those things we do understand. Too many people equate religion with ignorance, without considering the fact that the intelligent people who believe, must have a valid reason for doing so. And similarly, there are many ignorant people who have no religion. I cringe whenever a particularly proud, ignorant and Christian person is on the news saying something stupid because that just reinforces this ignorance=religion stereotype. I'm here to say intelligence=true religion. Believing in ignorance is just superstition whatever belief it may be. The more you understand your own beliefs, the more you want to learn.

Death by Black Hole is the perfect book for the reader who wants answers to questions about the universe in a simple and clearly defined way so that even if they know next to nothing about science and it’s jargon, Tyson makes it easily understandable.While I was hoping for something a little more in depth in the style of Brian Greene’s The Fabric of the Cosmos or Lee Smolin’s The Trouble With Physics, Death by Black Hole nevertheless provides quick and simple answers to many questions everyday readers without a science background have about physics, the universe, space, and most matters dealing with the cosmos. The book is a selection of his columns in Natural History that are organized in a somewhat textbook fashion. Tyson starts with the idea of science and nature in its basic form, how humanity views Earth, the solar system, the universe. Along with this discussion, Tyson also gives minor history lessons on the development of different ideas in physics and astronomy, what people came up with what big ideas and how the progression led to the development of the big theories of our current time with string theory and relativity. Going on from here, Death by Black Hole address the crucial steps that led to the formation of the universe and its development over the many billions and billions of years, again explaining how it is that scientists know what they do and what instruments were used, as well as the history of who invented and used said instruments.It is then that Tyson finally turns to the subject matter of the title of the book in the section “When the Universe Turns Bad: All the Ways the Cosmos Wants to Kill Us.” Here he addresses the complex and still relatively unknown subjects of chaos theory, dark matter (which constitutes over 90% of all matter in the universe, while we still know next to nothing about it), and finally black holes. Tyson takes the reader on a hypothetical journey with what would happen if one were to be sucked into a black hole and how as they approached the event horizon, they would become stretched until the elasticity point of their skin was surpassed and the body would be torn into thousands then millions of little pieces.With many questions now answered, in the next section Tyson discusses how science is viewed by the media, Hollywood, and people around the world in general. The final section addresses the concept of science and religion, again taking the reader on a historic journey through the development of first religion, then science, and the struggle that has ensued for centuries. It is the perfect end to a book on science, as Tyson lectures the importance of supporting fact and reality in a time when there are many who believe more in faith, even when all the evidence is to the contrary.For more book reviews, and author interviews, go to BookBanter."
111,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558652-emma-sea,3,"My main dissatisfaction with this book is that it's a series of collected magazine columns. This does seem a bit like criticising an apple because it's not a banana, however I think Tyson would have be been better advised to hire an editor to whip this into an actual book, rather than just reprint the original short essays. For example, in chapter 25 Tyson critiques the concept of the ""Goldilocks Zone"", discussing the myriad ways life could flourish in environments entirely dissimilar to our own e.g. in seas of liquid ammonia or methane. But then in the following chapter Tyson contends that life will only originate on a planet with a temperature that allows liquid water i.e. in the Goldilocks Zone. Originally these essays would have been published months or years apart, but juxtaposed like this it is a frustrating read, to say the least.The other problem with short essays is that things just start to get interesting and it's over. In chapter 21 Tyson briefly mentions technetium; an element with a half-life of only 2 million years, but which is nevertheless found in red giant stars. ""In other words, the star cannot have been born with the stuff, for if it were there would be none left by now. There is also no known mechanism to create technetium in a star's core and have it dredge itself up to the surface where it is observed, which has led to exotic theories that have yet to achieve consensus in the astrophysics community""But you know, those diverse and exotic theories are exactly what I'd like to hear about! That was the most interesting part of the book for me, and it just gets left lying gasping on the floor.Also, sadly, the book is aimed at someone who has done little or no prior science reading; a far broader generalist audience that I hoped for. I 100% agree with Maria's review, when she says this would be a good high-school-level book. If you don't generally read pop-science, but would like to learn more about how our universe works, I definitely recommend this book. Tyson is a great writer: engaging and able to explain complex ideas simply, with a dash of humour.For me it's a 2.5, rounded up."
112,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2593734-nicholas-armstrong,2,"I can already see the masses of Tyson fans charging ahead just to light me aflame for having the audicity to doubt a word he says, but so I must. To be fair, I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. I saw him speak at USC, I've watched his lectures and his interviews, and I think he has done more for popularizing science than anyone else. But none of that a writer makes. This is especially true of sarcastic and sardonic wit. Being funny in text is what I would rate as the most challenging things to accomplish (some comics may agree) because it loses so much of the presence, tone, and body language that makes something funny. Tyson is a legitimately funny person, I promise this, but aside from the knowledge that he wrote this, none of that translates well. I could guess that this is because much of his humor is in his intonations, pauses, and timing, something any classclown can tell you about. But not any classclown can write a best-selling comedic novel, nor can just any astro-physicist write a truly comic novel, or at least one which transfers that genius.What I'm getting at is that this book is dry. It seeks to inform, but it does so in a way that is just a little bit uninteresting and just a little bit reminscent of my astronomy courses. Interesting stuff, but the delivery was just all wrong.This wasn't assisted by the fact that the structuring of the book is terrible. To be fair, Tyson admits at the outset that this is little more than a collection of essays slapped back to back and tidied up a bit to try and make them fit, but that is exactly how they read. The transitions are generally poor and always jarring. The sentences don't blend together so much as float like an oily film, and trying to read too many consectutive pieces put together makes me feel as if my brain were a poorly done game of tetris - too many holes and not enough matching lines.But hey, I'm for anything that gets people reading, and I'm especially for anything that gets people reading about the world and about science. It goes without saying that I'm far happier this book is out there and so widely read than never having been published. I just prattle on because I'm a snot-nose with too many standards."
113,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5495893-leana-m,5,Well written and great stuff for the universe geek (or anyone with the slightest interest and curiosity for learning). NDT adds some fun with his quirks and humor. Allow me to indulge in a little pun here- And it ends with a bang. ;) 
114,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6071693-dale-jr,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson has become a bit of an inspiration and scientific hero to me. He's a man who strongly pushes forth to erase scientific ignorance and champions the exploration of our world and the universe to further human greatness.His lectures are intensely interesting and full of scientific knowledge, yet easy to follow by anyone willing to listen and apply their minds. He boils down some of the most complex theories and scientific facts so that they're easily understood. His writing is no different.I've been diving further and further into astrophysics and varying theories in related fields (string and multiverse theory is, simply put, awesome). This journey has made me quite familiar with Tyson and I figured it was about time to pick up one of his texts.Death by Black Hole is a collection of essays and lectures spanning the entire field of astrophysics and cosmology. From the Big Bang, to the life cycles of stars. From the speed of light to the mind-boggling power of black holes. There's even a section where Tyson describes the three biggest ways our world will come to an end. And it has nothing to do with ancient Mayan prophecy or the second coming.When scientifically investigating the natural world the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier.Since it is a collection of various lectures and essays, some information is repeated here and there, but it does not detract from the wealth of knowledge contained between the covers. I learned a lot. Retained most of it in one reading due to Tyson's way of writing and explaining. This is a book full of information, yet you never feel like your reading something as dry as a text book. Tyson makes you want to keep reading. He injects humor along with serious scientific education.I'm glad that his book lived up to my expectations of him and I will be sure to pick up his others. Quite frankly, this was the best non-fiction book I've read this year. Wonderfully executed and easily devoured. I feel both filled with new knowledge, and humbled by the amount I, and the rest of my human brothers and sisters, do not know yet.But as Tyson lays out in his book, it's not wrong to be ignorant of something as long as you are continuing to try and figure it out.Science is a philosophy of discovery. Intelligent design is a philosophy of ignorance. You cannot build a program of discovery on the assumption that nobody is smart enough to figure out the answer to the problem. Once upon a time, people identified the god Neptune as the source of storms at sea. Today we call these storms hurricanes. We know when and where they start. We know what drives them. We know what mitigates their destructive power. And anyone who has studied global warming can tell you what makes them worse. The only people who still call hurricanes ""acts of God"" are the people who write insurance forms."
115,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96664-samantha,4,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. His humor and straightforwardness were some of the best things about the History Channel documentary, The Universe. And his lectures on YouTube are always extremely inventive, interesting, and entertaining. So when I saw this book on the shelf at my local bookstore, I had to buy it.I wasn't disappointed.Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed learning about the universe. I'll never be an astrophysicist, but it always fascinates me to learn about all that's out there (and all that may be out there that we have yet to discover). Of course, the language of the cosmos is complicated: nebulae, pulsars, quasars, supernovas, black holes, event horizons, dark matter, antimatter, etc., etc.That's where Dr. Tyson comes in. He has an uncanny ability to take something that is unfailingly complex to the 'average' person such as myself and explain it in a way that I can understand. And he does so with unsurpassed humor, wit, and even the slightest bit of self-deprecation.In the end, he says, the universe is out to kill us. In many, many ways. And even though there is a lot we still don't understand about the universe and how it began and where it's going, that doesn't mean we stop looking. There is always more to learn, there is always more to discover, and if the essays in his book are any indication, it is all utterly fascinating.The last part of the book deals with science and religion. Dr. Tyson claims that being a scientist doesn't necessarily preclude belief in God. However, he staunchly claims that God has no business in scientific discovery, that simply crediting God with creating all the things that science can't currently explain opens the door to the cessation of scientific discovery. He quotes Galileo, who said, ""I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.""If the science vs. God debate makes you uncomfortable, have no fear--it's a very small part of the book, tucked in at the very end after all the terrific science essays.I highly recommend this book, even if you're only slightly interested in the universe. "
116,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2751053-bakari,5,"Astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson‘s Death By Black Hole is definitely an engaging read, especially for these modern times. Though many pages and chapters about the particulars of matter, energy, space, and time—the physics of the universe—were very difficult for my scientifically illiterate mind to comprehend, I read nearly ever page for nuggets of understanding. Tyson is a excellent writer because he knows his subject matter. Just think how different our Bible reading population would be if Tyson had wrote the Book of Genesis. His “in the beginning“ would have probably talked about the discoveries and meaning of supernovas, as the “primary source for the origin and relative mix of heavy elements in the universe.” He would have verses about Newton’s laws of motion and early twentieth century theories about quantum mechanics. His creation story would not be described in a mere seven days; his story would talk about billions of years—more time than most of us can imagine. But of course, the Bible was written in an era which lacked the scientific discoveries that Tyson writes about. But, but...this is what makes Death By Black Hole, and other books similar to it, so important. Reading a book like this provides us more knowledge about the universe and who we are as homo sapiens than Biblical writers could ever imagine. We simply need the education, patience, and study to learn what has been discovered. Though we are not, as Tyson writes in his essay, “Fear of Numbers,” “wired for logical thinking,” the brain, as he goes on to say, is “a marvelously flexible organ.” And in my view it’s time that more and more of us start using our brain to its greatest potential. Believing and praying to gods and reading horoscopes are no longer sufficient for our survival as a species. We can do much, much better than that.Perhaps a few months from now, I’ll read another of Tyson‘s books, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution, and view the PBS companion special as I do. It will be much like viewing the Carl Sagan’s Cosmos back in my college days. "
117,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4826452-evan-wondrasek,5,"Death by Black Hole is one of the most interesting non-fiction science books I've ever read. It's a collection of essays published by Neil deGrasse Tyson over the last 10+ years, and provides great, down-to-earth explanations of amazing astrophysics phenomena. This isn't a book about farfetched scenarios as its title implies - only a single chapter was actually about ""death by black hole"" - but the rest of the book presented a thorough and highly scientific explanation of the universe as we know it.Being that this book wasn't written as one cohesive text (it's a summary of essays as I mentioned), there is some informational overlap between the chapters. You'll be introduced to people like Galileo, Keppler, and Huygens more than once. I didn't mind at all, and I thought the overlap helped me solidify information.My favorite part of this book the crazy facts about celestial scale it presented. For example, the book states that a photon of light takes something like 500 seconds to go from the Sun's surface to the surface of earth; conversely, that same photon took upwards of 100,000 years to go from the Sun's core to the Sun's surface. Read the book and you'll learn why :)"
118,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3110398-sean,4,"I feel that the reason that people do not understand science in the US today is because we have a foolish tradition of thinking that the only way to ""know"" physics is through the terse formalism of mathematics. Math is a tool to do science, as much as a microscope or a superconducting supercollider. The disservice we do as scientists are when we are unable to communicate the concepts about our physical world to the population at large because we tangle ourselves up in mathematical formalism.Neil DeGrasse Tyson will never have that criticism hurled against him.It is in the tradition of Sagan, Gribbin and Hawking that Tyson writes and his essays are pure delight, discussing the concepts of physics as though he was having a casual coffee talk. It makes science fun. Yes your brain will come alive, but for a basic understanding of our physical world, this book should be read and I can't wait to read another by him.I even learned that laser spectroscopists and chemists label the same energy transitions differently. Awesome."
119,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4983144-colleen,4,"This is a great introduction into the world of astrophysics for the lay person. It's funny and engaging in a way you couldn't imagine a book about astrophysics being (without reading this book). How did it all begin and where are we going are just some of the cosmic quandaries that are tackled. It even has a whole section on how many ways the planet and its life could end! Fun stuff for a nerd like me. Plus, it touches on many other science/culture conundrums that are great food for thought. It was a tiny redundant, owing to the fact that these are all previously written essays collected for purpose of the book. But, I actually liked the redundancy. It allowed more time for the heavy science behind astrophysics to sink in, and I became more familiar with the scientists that propelled our cosmic knowledge forward. Overall, it was a great read. It was a refreshing break from the day-to-day politics and tedium that can make our lives feel very small. From the advantage of science, it truly put our Earthly lives into a cosmic perspective."
120,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a force to reckon with. But he is not Carl Sagan. While Sagan must have smiled down kindly on your meek acknowledgement of ignorance regarding, say, black holes, Tyson will have most probably given you the stink eye or aimed a sarcastic jibe at your apathy, before proceeding to explain why black holes still remain a topic of much speculation in the community of astrophysicists worldwide.Tyson does not pull any punches in this collection of essays while slamming the news media, who more often than not, come off as ill-informed hacks doing a shoddy job of reporting facts in the field of space science, forever (stupidly) claiming how scientists are baffled by so-and-so new developments. 
""Scientists cannot claim to be on the research frontier unless one thing or another baffles them. Bafflement drives discovery.""
Or snidely commenting on the Hollywood exercise of producing multi-million dollar sci-fi films which badly butcher the scientific aspects of such ventures by inserting factually incorrect observations in scenes and dialogues. (there's a brilliant anecdote concerning James Cameron's 'Titanic' in this regard and the Contact film gets an honorable mention for its adherence to proper science if one overlooks a minor gaffe)
""I am glad that, in the end, the humans win. We conquer the 'Independence Day' aliens by having a Macintosh laptop computer upload a software virus to the mothership. [] The entire defense system for the alien mothership must have been powered by the same release of Apple Computer's system software as the laptop computer that delivered the virus.""
Or criticizing the mad dash for extending the frontiers of space science during the Cold war years, when the spirit of scientific inquiry was sidelined in favor of a dangerous game of political one-upmanship, a kind of puerile assertion of 'our scientists are better than yours'. Or openly chastising revered names from ancient Greece like Aristotle whose inaccurate assumptions about the unchanging nature of stars and the geocentric universe helped the Catholic Church in propagating falsities for centuries with impunity. (He doesn't even spare Newton for God's Higgs Boson's sake who, unable to satisfactorily explain the ordered behavior of the solar system despite the many often conflicting gravitational forces at work, had cited God's need to step in to correct things in his famed 'Principia')While Sagan may have adopted a more benign, less aggressive tone in course of addressing issues of religious dogma being at loggerheads with scientific reasoning and aversion to science and mathematics among the general populace, NDT takes the approach of pure, unadulterated logic and demolishes one popular misconception after another (for e.g.:-the North Star is not the most brilliant star in the night sky or how everything that goes up doesn't come down) with a brute force which I am certain will not sit well with some sensitive readers who are easily offended. Being born in a country whose space research organization head performs pujas and makes ritualistic offerings prior to launching a 'Mission to Mars', I can't say I fault NDT's acerbic tone or his distaste for those who are hell-bent on unifying science and religion without even realizing that finding common ground between both is akin to attempting to exceed the velocity of light. But if NDT lacks Sagan's sage-like demeanour and his rich, authorial voice (Sagan's prose is much more refined no doubt), his excellent sense of humor almost compensates for their absence - 
""The good thing about the laws of physics is that they require no law enforcement agencies to maintain them, although I once owned a nerdy T-shirt that loudly proclaimed, ""OBEY GRAVITY.""

""The only people who still call hurricanes 'acts of God' are the people who write insurance forms.""
(and Michele Bachmann, just saying)And occasionally there's a sop thrown in for the literary-minded (particularly the postmodernist fiction lover) - ""The physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who in 1964 proposed the existence of quarks, and who at the time thought the quark family had only three members, drew the name from a characteristically elusive line in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake: 'Three quarks for Muster Mark!'""
The more frivolous aspects of the essays aside, among the astrophysics-related topics NDT centers his discussions around, the ones which were relatively new to me are the concepts of hypernovae, gamma ray bursts, dark matter and dark energy, the uncertainty surrounding the string theory and the probability of the annihilation of Earth through ill-fated, cosmic encounters with errant asteroids, the unavoidable, impending collision of our galaxy with the Andromeda galaxy which is the nearest one heading towards us at a speed of more than 100 kilometers per second.The Andromeda GalaxySince this is a collection of 42 essays which were published in the 'Natural History' magazine, some repetition of concepts and names creeps in occasionally but that merely helps you refresh memories of what you just read a few pages back, not exactly a shortcoming I am keen to quibble over. 4 stars, because Tyson seems a little too bitter about artists who exercise 'artistic license' to distort certain astronomical facts in their paintings. Besides I am certain there is a lot of 5-star-worthy goodness in the rest of NDT's works left for me to discover in the future."
121,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"This is a very fun read for all you science nerds... not only being clear and humorous but wide-ranging and careful to build up a number of those necessary building blocks of knowledge but doing it precisely in order to slam you with the good stuff later.Like how you'd DIE IN A BLACK HOLE... :)To belabor the obvious by the title. :)Seriously, this book gives us a ton of great ways to die and not just by black hole. I really appreciated that. :)I'd characterize this book as an easy to intermediate stage science book that's very far from being dull and it has a minimum of equations. I'm sure everyone has heard of thermodynamics and E=MC squared and Drake's equation, after all, but what really thrilled me about this was the truly wide array of subjects and Tyson's conversational tone.You can tell he is still a very, very good science teacher. :)I can almost hear him say, ""Let's throw out the crap, folks, let's dive right into the good stuff."" And he does, ranging from the Big Bang to the Heat Death, kinds of possible life on planets, the building blocks we need to understand science, including a great ""stick"" analogy for understanding the universe without computers, and he even gets into a bit of politics and religion because let's face it: it's a hot discussion item. But thankfully, it's only there as an afterthought.I wanted science and I got science, exploring the planets, the sun, even quasars, and especially Black Holes. That's the yummy stuff, after all.  10/10 Black Holes agree! Nom nom nom nom nom. I totally recommend this for both laymen and the intelligently curious and for anyone else who just likes a bit of the good (science) life. It really, really helps that Tyson's a great writer and clear as glass. The light passes right through it without slowing down at all! Can you believe it?"
122,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70078-chloe,4,"Within my skull, where all of those vital pieces of data surrounding science are supposed to be stored, there is instead a vast beaker-shaped void of ignorance. In high school, while we were supposed to be studying the musculature of the formaldehyde-soaked amphibians pinned ignominiously to their coffinesque metal trays, I was far more interested in studying the effects of adding fire to small green buds. During my brief time wandering the hallways of the University world, I was able to do away with my prerequisite requirement by taking an “Arts of Science” course tailor-made for those more interested in empathy than entropy and, while I did manage to get a crocodile on my report card, all I took away from that class was an abiding hatred for hippies. The long and the short of all this is that I didn’t know a quasar from a neutron or a brown dwarf from a red giant (though Red Dwarf was a magnificent television series).As a devout lover of science fiction and hi-tech gadgetry of all sorts, this was a matter of not a little shame for me. To resolve this I decided that it was time for me to fill in some of the (immense) gaps in my education the best way I know how- via book. Yet how to avoid having my eyes glaze over the moment someone started explaining cell structures or complex wave fields? Fortunately, as it often does, my television provided a solution when Stephen Colbert took a visit to the American Museum of Natural Historys Hayden Planetarium and spoke with its Director, Neil deGrasse Tyson. Tyson, while just as geeky as you would expect from an astrophysicist, is phenomenally skilled at taking incredibly complex scientific theories and translating them into a Common English that even Stephen Colbert is able to understand. My fate was sealed. This man was the ideal author to ease myself into the brave new world of stellar science.Death by Black Hole is a collection of essays the Tyson penned for Natural History magazine over the course of several years. Each essay addresses a different topic, running the gamut from the birth of the universe, the history of astronomical discoveries, humankind’s fixation on the red hills of Mars and the life-bringing water that may lay frozen away, all the way to the Pluto Wars (it’s amazing just how contentious Pluto’s status as planet is). Of course there’s some overlap between the chapters and some facts get repeated but, rather than bugging me, I found it to be a good refresher of what had come before that helped solidify my basic understanding of the concepts at hand. Most interesting to me, policy junkie that I am, is the closing essay in which Tyson writes about the plague of scientific ignorance sweeping the country. After almost brutally doing away with that Bible-in-textbook-clothing anachronism that is “intelligent design,” he makes great points about America’s waning prestige in scientific research and the future costs, both economic and academic, that we will have to pay due to ceding our intellectual priority to advance knowledge. I’m not much interested in sustaining American supremacy in any field, but I can always get behind an argument for strengthening education.What I most enjoyed was the excitement that Tyson has for his field. He doesn’t get bogged down in the minutiae of atomic weights and the like, but thrills at the possibilities of quantum mechanics and takes an almost excessive amount of joy in ruminating over the possible ways that people can be killed in space from the atom-splitting nullification of crossing a black hole’s event horizon to the persistent fear of a species-leveling asteroid striking Earth. Tyson is a man possessed of a childlike sense of wonder at the mysteries of the universe that sees the current limits of our scientific understanding not as having reached the final frontiers of science but as hurdles to be vaulted over in our quest to know. His enthusiasm is quite contagious and I challenge any reader to emerge from this book without being excited about science."
123,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"I have often lamented the passing of my favorite popular scientist, Carl Sagan, by talking about how necessary he is right now. We are at a point in our history where scientific illiteracy is growing, where people are not only ignorant of how science works, but are proud of their ignorance. What we need is someone who can reach the majority of Americans who are not especially scientifically literate - the people whose automatic reaction to science is to think, ""That's just too hard for me to deal with.""Enter Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and the director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. He's appeared on countless television programs, including The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, to talk about the current state of astronomy and astrophysics. He's an engaging and entertaining man, who claims that Pluto was ""asking for"" its demotion, who seems to take perverse pleasure in describing all the terrible ways the universe could take us out. He knows that we're in a precarious position, here on Earth, and he revels in it rather than worrying about it. Whereas Sagan seemed to come from the point of view that the universe was a place of infinite wonder, where one could look anywhere and be awed and humbled, Tyson's attitude is more of the universe as an infinite theme park - a place where you could see your electrons stripped from your body, watch gas clouds larger than our own solar system collide and ignite, or see planets crumple under cosmic bombardment. Tyson's universe is an adventure, as big as it gets.This book is a collection of essays that Tyson wrote for Natural History magazine over a ten year period, on a variety of subjects related to science and scientific inquiry. In many ways, it's similar to every other pop science book out there - and there are so very many of them - but it is his perspective and his voice that makes this one stand out from the crowd.He's grouped his essays into seven sections, on topics ranging from the difficulties inherent in actually knowing anything about the universe to the understanding of how life went from little mindless bacteria to we clever Homo sapiens to the intersection of science and religion. Most of it is accessible to the average non-scientist, though he does get a little technical at points. But he understands that, and he tries to compensate for for the fact that, by and large, the public is intimidated by ""real science."" In the essay entitled, ""Over the Rainbow,"" he discusses this particular challenge by using spectroscopy as an example.In spectroscopy, astrophysicists look at the spectrum of a star, hunting for telltale dark lines that indicate the physical properties of stars. It's like looking at a rainbow with bits blackened out of it, as though the CIA had somehow gotten to it first. Those black lines contain all the vital information about the star's composition and, more importantly, speed. Very little can be gleaned by just looking at the star, as it turns out. He notes five levels of abstraction, starting from the star itself:Level 0: A starLevel 1: Picture of a starLevel 2: Light from the picture of a starLevel 3: Spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.Level 4: Patterns of lines lacing the spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.Level 5: Shifts in the patterns of lines in the spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.These descending levels of abstraction can apply to any branch of science, not just astrophysics. The challenge, as he notes, is getting people past level 1, which is easy to understand but is not the level at which true science is done. It is up to educators, he says, to help make people comfortable with looking at real science, and not just pretty pictures.Indeed, there are several sections of the book dedicated to the intersection between science and the public. He talks about how easily we are baffled by numbers (why are below-ground floors not labeled -1, -2, -3 etc?) and how casually we disregard actual scientific facts. He brings up some of his favorite moments in bad movie science, and how he single-handedly saved Titanic from ignominious astronomical shame. At least, on its DVD re-release. He addresses the historically shifting centers of science in human history, how things like NASA are truly a global endeavor. Without the discoveries made through history by people all over the planet - from England to Greece to Baghdad - there would be no NASA, nor any science that we recognize. And to assume that the United States will always be the center of scientific discovery is to willfully ignore history.And, of course, there's a section dedicated to the conflict between religion and science, a never-ending battle that has existed since science began. Tyson believes that there can be no common ground between the two - science relies on facts, religion relies on faith. This is not to say that one is better than the other, any more than, say, a hammer is better than a screwdriver. It's just that you can't use them interchangeably. And he points out that becoming a scientist doesn't require you to give up your faith. There have been, and still are, countless scientists who are believers in the Divine. It's just that most of them know enough not to confuse science and spirituality. The place where they meet, historically, is on the boundary of ignorance. Isaac Newton, having figured out gravity, couldn't quite work out how you could have a multiple-body system like our solar system without the whole thing falling into chaos. His conclusion - God must, from time to time, step in to keep things on the right path. Having done that, Newton went on to do other things, and it wasn't until the next century that Pierre-Simon laPlace decided that he wasn't satisfied with Newton's ""Insert God Here"" argument, and did the math for himself.In other words, God is a marker on the boundaries of ignorance, and the best of us are tempted to let Him answer the questions that we can't. To do so, however, impedes the path of science and stops progress in its tracks. What if Newton had said, ""No, I'm going to figure this damn thing out."" Would we be a century ahead in our technology by now? Maybe, maybe not. What if the Catholic Church had listened when Galileo said, ""The Bible tells you how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."" Might more progress have been made? So many great thinkers have come up to the boundaries of their knowledge and, humbled by what they do not know, chose to allow The God of the Gaps reassure them.But that's the whole point of science, and it's what this book, and others like it, are trying to instill in people. The unknown is not horrible, it is not terrifying, and it's not a place to just stop. It's a place of awe and wonder and bafflement and opportunity. To say, ""I don't understand it - it must be God"" is short-changing ourselves and our heirs out of even greater knowledge of the universe."
124,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392197-jocelyn,5,"I don't think I can properly explain how much I love this book, but I'll try.Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries is a collection of essays Tyson wrote for Natural History, a magazine dedicated to -- you guessed it -- natural history (basically, science) between 1995-2005.What I like about it:- Tyson writes in a way that's easily accessible for anyone even without a science background. His analogies are easy to understand and they're fun. Like, ""Oh, Neil deGrasse Tyson, you."" Also, he tries to explain complex terms or theories so that you can finish the book and be a pseudo-astrophysicist. Now you can go to dinner parties and impress people with your knowledge about quarks and black holes and radio waves.- Tyson's writing is jovial and light-hearted. He frequently cracks jokes to lighten the mood -- you don't want to be bored. (Of course, I am a huge physics nerd and he could drone on and on about string theory and it could never bore me.) At one point, he jokes about red shirts. Red shirts, people! This guy's a winner.- Tyson takes the time to highlight two ways science (broadly) and astro-/physics (specifically) relate to both theology and culture. The Science and Culture section of the book was interesting, because what he describes is true: there is a misunderstanding between what scientists are doing and what the public thinks the scientists are doing. His little asides (rants) are fun, too.- This was a very informative book for just being a collection of 5-10 page essays. If you're new to astrophysics, the universe and particles, this stuff is like gold -- I don't think I've seen/heard any of the phenomena explained in a clearer way. If you're not new to any of this, then you probably shouldn't be reading this because you've probably already read it. Unless you really like it.Issues for some people, but weren't issues for me:- I understand that some people may go, ""Ugh, why does everything that has to do with science bring up religion and God!"" Tyson does dedicate a whole section of the book to (omg) 3 essays dealing with religion's place in science. He does so tactfully and tastefully. I'm not a religious person, but I don't think he would have offended anyone. And besides, religion and science have been at each others' throats since the dawn of both. If a popular astrophysicist didn't bring it up, someone would have asked why he didn't bring it up.- There's some repetition going on because, if you've read the preface and my review you'll know, this is a collection of essays from a magazine. There's bound to be some repetition because non-sciencey readers need to be reminded that Planck is considered the father of quantum mechanics and that Einstein's theory of relativity is a furthering of Newton's theory of gravity. Honestly, the repetition isn't enough where you would roll your eyes and mutter, ""Redundant.""- Some people may not be okay with Tyson's little rants. In one part he complains about the scientific ignorance going on in Hollywood skylines. Some readers may just want him to stop complaining and shut up already, but he has a right to his discontent. When you're a professional in your field, things that are obviously wrong annoy you more than those that don't belong to your field. You should see how irritated my family gets when I point out the inconsistencies movies have in regards to language and sociolinguistic situations. His annoyance is justified.Basically, what this all boils down to is this:How can you not like a man who dresses in a waistcoat with suns and stars on it?How can you not like a man whose reaction to Newton became a meme?Seriously, though, this book is awesome."
125,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309472-maria,3,"I have one last section to go (Religion and Science), but my main points won't be affected by it.Death By Black Hole provides, especially in the first couple of sections, a really good outline of various problems that astrophysicists are confronted with, and it definitely made me think of the scientific process in a new way. So that was pretty cool. But on the whole, my reaction was rather meh - kind of disappointing when the book really isn't bad. My main complaint about the book isn't actually the book's fault. It's just way below my level, and I found myself frequently bored. I think the best audience for the book is someone who's never had an astronomy class, and is maybe familiar with basic physics and chemistry. I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I read it in high school. I did learn a handful of new things, and sometimes Tyson's explanations helped some points I was fuzzy on click into place, but on the whole, I would have preferred the book to be much more detailed.My second problem is that, as Tyson says in the preface, the book is composed of various essays that he wrote for a magazine over the years, and that they were only slightly edited for continuity when he was preparing the book. Big mistake. While this divided the book into bite-sized, easy to process pieces, it also made it a helluva lot repetitive. Several phenomena were explained two, or even three times throughout the book. It should really have been edited a lot more aggressively.But on the whole, I think this is a really good pick for a layperson who doesn't know much about astronomy and isn't interested in involved explanations of the physical and chemical side of things. Neil deGrasse Tyson is one eloquent guy, and writes with an infectious passion for his subject. "
126,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"As a scientist, at first I was rather bored by this book. I was not learning anything new, and not gaining new insights into astronomy.But, as I read further, it just hit me--this book is tremendously entertaining! If you are a layman, and looking for a unique viewpoint, you could do a lot worse than this book. And, believe it or not, you will be entertained!In addition, Tyson puts several aspects of astronomy and astrophysics into a unique perspective. He describes all the ways that the universe is trying to kill us--storms, viruses, meteors, comets, climate change, volcanoes, and so on. But many of these lethal phenomena could be responsible for life existing on Earth, in the first place!I really did appreciate the arguments put forward against the idea of ""Intelligent Design."" Just because some areas in cosmology are not understood, does not mean that one is required to invoke God as a cause. Science always works on the frontier of knowledge, and if we were always to state that God is responsible for things we do not yet understand, then we would be working on the frontier of ignorance. Tyson does a much better job than I can, in explaining this concept. Highly recommended!"
127,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,4,"Neil is without doubt one of the greatest scientific communicators alive. He is erudite and hilarious with no apparent effort and can always bring the 'wow'.I enjoy his podcast and have probably watched near all videos on youtube that feature him. This is the first time that I have tried his written work and I am very pleased with the results.This work is a collection of editorial pieces that Neil writes for a periodical. They are intended to be short, punchy scientific stories and not form an ongoing dialogue.In this respect Neil did a brilliant job. I dipped in and out of this book over the last couple of weeks and it was simple to pick up again after each break. I read it while doing experiments in the lab, and I read it while on the toilet.What let the collection down (just the tiniest smidgen) was that some material was covered twice. Fine for an ongoing column and understandable for a collection, but still, a little work could have been taken to cull and back reference sections.Don't get me wrong, I adored this book. And anyone who has not discovered love for Neil needs to read it immediately. You'll definitely connect with him if you are sceptical, scientific or just a spotter of bullshit.This book left me wanting more. I want some long form stories, woven into a larger narrative. I have 'The Pluto Files' on my shelf. Maybe it won't be long before I open it."

The whole time I was listening to this, it was like listening to Charlie Browns teacher. whaa wha whaa wha whaa Galileo, wha wha E=mc2, whaa whaa whaa Gravity sucks.I would get some really good, crunchy tidbit and be riveted.....and then the mind would drift to something like ""I wonder if I fed the cats, and CRAP I forgot to start the dishwasher""........then I would drift back to the science stuff.It just didn't hold my attention."
129,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37690097-ahmed-r-rashwan,4,"So I have a thing for Black Holes, so what?! You knew that already! You didn't? Well now you do.I have had an obsession with Black Holes for as long as I can remember. It was perhaps one of the first phenomena of the big umbrella of Astronomy and Cosmology that I was introduced to and I immediately fell in love with; I mean what is there not to love. An equal or even grander obsession is awarded of course to the author of this brilliant book.Of course, as with almost all scientific books, the title is pretty elusive. Yes, there was talk of Black Holes, a lot of talk, but there was a slew of other cosmological subjects too! But, of course, you will hear absolutely no complaints from me. As my favourite astronomer, I am inspired by Neil deGrasse Tyson much in the same way he was probably inspired by Carl Sagan.There is probably no other human beings on this planet that have invested more to the field of astronomy like Sagan and Tyson have. I, of course, do not mean this in a scientific sense but a commercial one. Sagan and Tyson are to Astronomy what Bill Nye is to Science.So for all intends and purposes, this review is in fact a form of praising for Neil deGrasse Tyson and his meaning to me as a person rather than a review of the actual book. There are simply some people out there who's literary work is completely overshadowed by their contributions to the subject upon which they write about, so I will dismiss the small quantity of repetitiveness inherent in all scientific books (especially ones comprising of several essays).They tell you never to meet your heroes, that it is somehow inevitable to be disappointed by such an interaction; that the perfect image you have most definitely built of your heroes is most certainly to fall short of reality. But while I cannot claim to have met Neil deGrasse Tyson, I have at least had a closer glimpse to his personal opinions and thoughts. I shied away from this book for the longest time specifically for fear of being disappointed by the literary work of a person I probably hold the highest esteem of amongst all people.I don't even recall when or how I was first ""introduced"" to Neil but what followed was an obsession that has lasted years, till this day. I have probably watched his 'Cosmos' show, inspired by Carl Sagan's Cosmos up to at least 5 times. Neil is funny, witty, intelligent and very very charismatic. If it wasn't for him, there would have definitely been so many different aspects of astronomy that I wouldn't have particularly grabbed. His style of ""story-telling"" transports you back to a time when anything interested you, when your explorer genes were yet to be suppressed; just like you were a little kid again. So it comes as no surprise that I read the entire book imagining Neil was narrating it to me, for I had completely memorised his pattern of speech and voice, and it is equally not surprising that I would love any work, literary or otherwise that Neil produces.I ask nothing more of men of science, to be able to pass down the passion in the way that Neil has been very successful in doing is the calling for all of scientists, regardless of their field of study."

I've read quite a bit of these types of books, physics for the layperson, and this book was probably my least favorite.I don't like the overall tone of the book. Tyson makes a point to belittle the human race as much as possible and he comes across as pessimistic. By no means do I think humans are the pinnacle of perfection, but I think we're doing pretty well.The content of the book was all over the place and only briefly touched on black holes and other cosmic quandaries. In fact the titular cosmological event, though an ""entire"" chapter, was hardly described while long tangents about minor events in historical figures' lives were expounded in detail.I don't recommend this book to any but those that are cursorily interested in cosmology. I recommend Hawking, Brian Greene or Amir Aczel."

A collection of essays about a myriad of cosmic topics from Natural History magazine written by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson (you've probably seen him on PBS, and no he's not the night sky guy with the weird voice), this book entertains. Frightens. Enlightens. And inevitably makes you feel much, much smarter for reading it. But believe me, sometimes this knowledge is a scary, scary thing! In fact, now I'd like to take some of it back. Oh, brain atrophy!Except for a few about half way through that made my eyes start to glaze over, I found most of these essays really interesting and readable. Tyson is obviously one of those well known science professionals who is actually interested in, and good at, teaching (believe it or not!) instead of just doing research and publishing. So yes, they do exist..Way, oh way back in the dark ages when I was in college I took a series of physics classes from an astronaut named Don Lind. He was a cocky ass who said stuff like, if you ever get a chance to fly in space.. . I wanted to slap him...anyway, I remember learning about prisms and color and how our brain interprets it, and thinking that was the coolest thing! I remember telling my twelve year old sister about it, about how a prism works and why we are able to see that myriad of colors without moving our eyes (look it up, it's really cool!). She looked at me like I was a martian from outer space who'd just landed and interrupted an episode of Get Smart, and made fun of me for years because of it. Well, neiner neiner.

According to her numbers, that leaves 0.0000004 planets with intelligent life on them, which is a figure somewhat lower than “millions.” No doubt that “one in a million” sounds better on screen than “one in ten,” but you can’t fake math. The book did have it's flaws, some repetitions and some dull moments , but just a few.If you like the subject….. read this book. "

Neil goes over some really interesting concepts, but they aren't what I would say for advanced readers. Much like his work on Cosmos, the concepts are simple but entertaining and informative. This is a book you could give to beginners who are just dipping their toes into astronomy, physics and earth space sciences. Like always, it's written in a warmer tone than say, Dawkins or Hitchens, and is even more accessible than Hawking although his works are written for the every day person as well. I wouldn't say this is for kids, but kids who are ""advanced"" in reading and sciences would get a kick out of this. I'd love to meet this guy one day.

to deny or erase the rich, colorful history of scientists and other thinkers who have invoked divinity in their work would be intellectually dishonest. surely there's an appropriate place for intelligent design to live in the academic landscape. how about the history of religion? how about philosophy or psychology? the one place it doesn't belong is the science classroom.if you're not swayed by academic arguments, consider the financial consequences. allow intelligent design into science textbooks, lecture halls, and laboratories, and the cost to the frontier of scientific discovery - the frontier that drives the economies of the future - would be incalculable. i don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed and therefore beyond their intellectual capacity. the day that happens, americans will just sit in awe of what we don't understand, while we watch the rest of the world boldly go where no mortal has gone before.

139,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879178-kathy,3,"A great title for a book, that alone made me want to read it. Of course, this is the type of book I will almost always pick up from the library. It is a collection of essays on science for the magazine Natural History. It covers a wide range of topics, usually relating to physics, from particle physics to astrophysics. I love this stuff and I only wish I retained enough math to be able to read more technical discussions than these rather general essays.The essays are informative and entertaining. A lot has changed in the 17 years since I took my particle physics class at BYU, so I am always interested to learn more. Not only does he describe what is happening in science, he describes the edges very well. By edges I mean the places where scientists are not sure what is happening and are actively searching for answers. That is always the most interesting part of any science. The problem today is that to get to that edge, you have to take years of schooling to understand what they are looking for. Once the edge could be explored in your home lab or a field (if you were Benjamin Franklin) now you need millions of dollars and a space telescope.The book is a bit repetitive, though that often happens with collections of essays because each one had to be self contained and couldn't refer to last month's issue. There has been a bit of editing to smooth out the sequencing and to make it an easier read.While I enjoyed all the essays, I took exception to the last one, entitled, The Perimeter of Ignorance. Here is the author's basic premise, Writing in centuries past, many scientists felt compelled to wax poetic about cosmic mysteries and God's handiwork. Perhaps one should not be surprised at this: most scientists back then, as well as many scientists today, identify themselves as spiritually devout. But a careful reading of older texts, particularly those concerned with the universe itself, shows that the authors invoke divinity only when they reach the boundaries of their understanding. They appeal to a higher power only when staring at the ocean of their own ignorance. They call on God only from the lonely and precarious edge of incomprehension. Where they feel certain about their explanations, however, God hardly gets a mention.He goes on from this hypothesis to give some quotes from Newton and other scientists, who do indeed see an explanation for the unexplainable in the presence of God. He then links this tendency to the current vogue for intelligent design. That also follows, more or less. I have my own issues with intelligent design, at least how it is being explained and used in the public sphere, but I won't go into all that here. The problem I have is that the author considers an appeal to deity as an admission of failure and the mental equivalent of throwing up your hands and saying, ""Heck if I know, only God could figure that out, I will just go find something easier to study, like Paris Hilton."" He says, in talking about intelligent design and the dangers of it, I don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed and therefore beyond their intellectual capacity.Since when is saying something is divinely designed the same as saying we are not capable of understanding it? As a devout person, but one who would have been a scientist, if not for a few chance decisions and a problem with basic arithmetic, I find everything divinely inspired, even those things we do understand. Too many people equate religion with ignorance, without considering the fact that the intelligent people who believe, must have a valid reason for doing so. And similarly, there are many ignorant people who have no religion. I cringe whenever a particularly proud, ignorant and Christian person is on the news saying something stupid because that just reinforces this ignorance=religion stereotype. I'm here to say intelligence=true religion. Believing in ignorance is just superstition whatever belief it may be. The more you understand your own beliefs, the more you want to learn. Our brains are designed to increase in knowledge, anything that does that helps all of us, no matter what the information may be."
140,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,3,"DEATH BY BLACK HOLE AND OTHER COSMIC QUANDARIES BY NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: An astrophysicist for the American Museum of Natural History, director of the world famous Hayden Planetarium, and columnist for Natural History magazine, Neil DeGrasse Tyson brings to the non-scientific world the ideal book for those fascinated with space, the cosmos, black holes, and all the questions and wonders therein. Death by Black Hole is the perfect book for the reader who wants answers to questions about the universe in a simple and clearly defined way so that even if they know next to nothing about science and it’s jargon, Tyson makes it easily understandable.While I was hoping for something a little more in depth in the style of Brian Greene’s The Fabric of the Cosmos or Lee Smolin’s The Trouble With Physics, Death by Black Hole nevertheless provides quick and simple answers to many questions everyday readers without a science background have about physics, the universe, space, and most matters dealing with the cosmos. The book is a selection of his columns in Natural History that are organized in a somewhat textbook fashion. Tyson starts with the idea of science and nature in its basic form, how humanity views Earth, the solar system, the universe. Along with this discussion, Tyson also gives minor history lessons on the development of different ideas in physics and astronomy, what people came up with what big ideas and how the progression led to the development of the big theories of our current time with string theory and relativity. Going on from here, Death by Black Hole address the crucial steps that led to the formation of the universe and its development over the many billions and billions of years, again explaining how it is that scientists know what they do and what instruments were used, as well as the history of who invented and used said instruments.It is then that Tyson finally turns to the subject matter of the title of the book in the section “When the Universe Turns Bad: All the Ways the Cosmos Wants to Kill Us.” Here he addresses the complex and still relatively unknown subjects of chaos theory, dark matter (which constitutes over 90% of all matter in the universe, while we still know next to nothing about it), and finally black holes. Tyson takes the reader on a hypothetical journey with what would happen if one were to be sucked into a black hole and how as they approached the event horizon, they would become stretched until the elasticity point of their skin was surpassed and the body would be torn into thousands then millions of little pieces.With many questions now answered, in the next section Tyson discusses how science is viewed by the media, Hollywood, and people around the world in general. The final section addresses the concept of science and religion, again taking the reader on a historic journey through the development of first religion, then science, and the struggle that has ensued for centuries. It is the perfect end to a book on science, as Tyson lectures the importance of supporting fact and reality in a time when there are many who believe more in faith, even when all the evidence is to the contrary.For more book reviews, and author interviews, go to BookBanter."
141,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558652-emma-sea,3,"My main dissatisfaction with this book is that it's a series of collected magazine columns. This does seem a bit like criticising an apple because it's not a banana, however I think Tyson would have be been better advised to hire an editor to whip this into an actual book, rather than just reprint the original short essays. For example, in chapter 25 Tyson critiques the concept of the ""Goldilocks Zone"", discussing the myriad ways life could flourish in environments entirely dissimilar to our own e.g. in seas of liquid ammonia or methane. But then in the following chapter Tyson contends that life will only originate on a planet with a temperature that allows liquid water i.e. in the Goldilocks Zone. Originally these essays would have been published months or years apart, but juxtaposed like this it is a frustrating read, to say the least.The other problem with short essays is that things just start to get interesting and it's over. In chapter 21 Tyson briefly mentions technetium; an element with a half-life of only 2 million years, but which is nevertheless found in red giant stars. ""In other words, the star cannot have been born with the stuff, for if it were there would be none left by now. There is also no known mechanism to create technetium in a star's core and have it dredge itself up to the surface where it is observed, which has led to exotic theories that have yet to achieve consensus in the astrophysics community""But you know, those diverse and exotic theories are exactly what I'd like to hear about! That was the most interesting part of the book for me, and it just gets left lying gasping on the floor.Also, sadly, the book is aimed at someone who has done little or no prior science reading; a far broader generalist audience that I hoped for. I 100% agree with Maria's review, when she says this would be a good high-school-level book. If you don't generally read pop-science, but would like to learn more about how our universe works, I definitely recommend this book. Tyson is a great writer: engaging and able to explain complex ideas simply, with a dash of humour.For me it's a 2.5, rounded up."
142,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2593734-nicholas-armstrong,2,"I can already see the masses of Tyson fans charging ahead just to light me aflame for having the audicity to doubt a word he says, but so I must. To be fair, I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. I saw him speak at USC, I've watched his lectures and his interviews, and I think he has done more for popularizing science than anyone else. But none of that a writer makes. This is especially true of sarcastic and sardonic wit. Being funny in text is what I would rate as the most challenging things to accomplish (some comics may agree) because it loses so much of the presence, tone, and body language that makes something funny. Tyson is a legitimately funny person, I promise this, but aside from the knowledge that he wrote this, none of that translates well. I could guess that this is because much of his humor is in his intonations, pauses, and timing, something any classclown can tell you about. But not any classclown can write a best-selling comedic novel, nor can just any astro-physicist write a truly comic novel, or at least one which transfers that genius.What I'm getting at is that this book is dry. It seeks to inform, but it does so in a way that is just a little bit uninteresting and just a little bit reminscent of my astronomy courses. Interesting stuff, but the delivery was just all wrong.This wasn't assisted by the fact that the structuring of the book is terrible. To be fair, Tyson admits at the outset that this is little more than a collection of essays slapped back to back and tidied up a bit to try and make them fit, but that is exactly how they read. The transitions are generally poor and always jarring. The sentences don't blend together so much as float like an oily film, and trying to read too many consectutive pieces put together makes me feel as if my brain were a poorly done game of tetris - too many holes and not enough matching lines.But hey, I'm for anything that gets people reading, and I'm especially for anything that gets people reading about the world and about science. It goes without saying that I'm far happier this book is out there and so widely read than never having been published. I just prattle on because I'm a snot-nose with too many standards."
143,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5495893-leana-m,5,Well written and great stuff for the universe geek (or anyone with the slightest interest and curiosity for learning). NDT adds some fun with his quirks and humor. Allow me to indulge in a little pun here- And it ends with a bang. ;) 
144,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6071693-dale-jr,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson has become a bit of an inspiration and scientific hero to me. He's a man who strongly pushes forth to erase scientific ignorance and champions the exploration of our world and the universe to further human greatness.His lectures are intensely interesting and full of scientific knowledge, yet easy to follow by anyone willing to listen and apply their minds. He boils down some of the most complex theories and scientific facts so that they're easily understood. His writing is no different.I've been diving further and further into astrophysics and varying theories in related fields (string and multiverse theory is, simply put, awesome). This journey has made me quite familiar with Tyson and I figured it was about time to pick up one of his texts.Death by Black Hole is a collection of essays and lectures spanning the entire field of astrophysics and cosmology. From the Big Bang, to the life cycles of stars. From the speed of light to the mind-boggling power of black holes. There's even a section where Tyson describes the three biggest ways our world will come to an end. And it has nothing to do with ancient Mayan prophecy or the second coming.When scientifically investigating the natural world the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier.Since it is a collection of various lectures and essays, some information is repeated here and there, but it does not detract from the wealth of knowledge contained between the covers. I learned a lot. Retained most of it in one reading due to Tyson's way of writing and explaining. This is a book full of information, yet you never feel like your reading something as dry as a text book. Tyson makes you want to keep reading. He injects humor along with serious scientific education.I'm glad that his book lived up to my expectations of him and I will be sure to pick up his others. Quite frankly, this was the best non-fiction book I've read this year. Wonderfully executed and easily devoured. I feel both filled with new knowledge, and humbled by the amount I, and the rest of my human brothers and sisters, do not know yet.But as Tyson lays out in his book, it's not wrong to be ignorant of something as long as you are continuing to try and figure it out.Science is a philosophy of discovery. Intelligent design is a philosophy of ignorance. You cannot build a program of discovery on the assumption that nobody is smart enough to figure out the answer to the problem. Once upon a time, people identified the god Neptune as the source of storms at sea. Today we call these storms hurricanes. We know when and where they start. We know what drives them. We know what mitigates their destructive power. And anyone who has studied global warming can tell you what makes them worse. The only people who still call hurricanes ""acts of God"" are the people who write insurance forms."
145,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96664-samantha,4,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. His humor and straightforwardness were some of the best things about the History Channel documentary, The Universe. And his lectures on YouTube are always extremely inventive, interesting, and entertaining. So when I saw this book on the shelf at my local bookstore, I had to buy it.I wasn't disappointed.Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed learning about the universe. I'll never be an astrophysicist, but it always fascinates me to learn about all that's out there (and all that may be out there that we have yet to discover). Of course, the language of the cosmos is complicated: nebulae, pulsars, quasars, supernovas, black holes, event horizons, dark matter, antimatter, etc., etc.That's where Dr. Tyson comes in. He has an uncanny ability to take something that is unfailingly complex to the 'average' person such as myself and explain it in a way that I can understand. And he does so with unsurpassed humor, wit, and even the slightest bit of self-deprecation.In the end, he says, the universe is out to kill us. In many, many ways. And even though there is a lot we still don't understand about the universe and how it began and where it's going, that doesn't mean we stop looking. There is always more to learn, there is always more to discover, and if the essays in his book are any indication, it is all utterly fascinating.The last part of the book deals with science and religion. Dr. Tyson claims that being a scientist doesn't necessarily preclude belief in God. However, he staunchly claims that God has no business in scientific discovery, that simply crediting God with creating all the things that science can't currently explain opens the door to the cessation of scientific discovery. He quotes Galileo, who said, ""I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.""If the science vs. God debate makes you uncomfortable, have no fear--it's a very small part of the book, tucked in at the very end after all the terrific science essays.I highly recommend this book, even if you're only slightly interested in the universe. "
146,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2751053-bakari,5,"Astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson‘s Death By Black Hole is definitely an engaging read, especially for these modern times. Though many pages and chapters about the particulars of matter, energy, space, and time—the physics of the universe—were very difficult for my scientifically illiterate mind to comprehend, I read nearly ever page for nuggets of understanding. Tyson is a excellent writer because he knows his subject matter. Just think how different our Bible reading population would be if Tyson had wrote the Book of Genesis. His “in the beginning“ would have probably talked about the discoveries and meaning of supernovas, as the “primary source for the origin and relative mix of heavy elements in the universe.” He would have verses about Newton’s laws of motion and early twentieth century theories about quantum mechanics. His creation story would not be described in a mere seven days; his story would talk about billions of years—more time than most of us can imagine. But of course, the Bible was written in an era which lacked the scientific discoveries that Tyson writes about. But, but...this is what makes Death By Black Hole, and other books similar to it, so important. Reading a book like this provides us more knowledge about the universe and who we are as homo sapiens than Biblical writers could ever imagine. We simply need the education, patience, and study to learn what has been discovered. Though we are not, as Tyson writes in his essay, “Fear of Numbers,” “wired for logical thinking,” the brain, as he goes on to say, is “a marvelously flexible organ.” And in my view it’s time that more and more of us start using our brain to its greatest potential. Believing and praying to gods and reading horoscopes are no longer sufficient for our survival as a species. We can do much, much better than that.Perhaps a few months from now, I’ll read another of Tyson‘s books, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution, and view the PBS companion special as I do. It will be much like viewing the Carl Sagan’s Cosmos back in my college days. "
147,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4826452-evan-wondrasek,5,"Death by Black Hole is one of the most interesting non-fiction science books I've ever read. It's a collection of essays published by Neil deGrasse Tyson over the last 10+ years, and provides great, down-to-earth explanations of amazing astrophysics phenomena. This isn't a book about farfetched scenarios as its title implies - only a single chapter was actually about ""death by black hole"" - but the rest of the book presented a thorough and highly scientific explanation of the universe as we know it.Being that this book wasn't written as one cohesive text (it's a summary of essays as I mentioned), there is some informational overlap between the chapters. You'll be introduced to people like Galileo, Keppler, and Huygens more than once. I didn't mind at all, and I thought the overlap helped me solidify information.My favorite part of this book the crazy facts about celestial scale it presented. For example, the book states that a photon of light takes something like 500 seconds to go from the Sun's surface to the surface of earth; conversely, that same photon took upwards of 100,000 years to go from the Sun's core to the Sun's surface. Read the book and you'll learn why :)"
148,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3110398-sean,4,"I feel that the reason that people do not understand science in the US today is because we have a foolish tradition of thinking that the only way to ""know"" physics is through the terse formalism of mathematics. Math is a tool to do science, as much as a microscope or a superconducting supercollider. The disservice we do as scientists are when we are unable to communicate the concepts about our physical world to the population at large because we tangle ourselves up in mathematical formalism.Neil DeGrasse Tyson will never have that criticism hurled against him.It is in the tradition of Sagan, Gribbin and Hawking that Tyson writes and his essays are pure delight, discussing the concepts of physics as though he was having a casual coffee talk. It makes science fun. Yes your brain will come alive, but for a basic understanding of our physical world, this book should be read and I can't wait to read another by him.I even learned that laser spectroscopists and chemists label the same energy transitions differently. Awesome."
149,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4983144-colleen,4,"This is a great introduction into the world of astrophysics for the lay person. It's funny and engaging in a way you couldn't imagine a book about astrophysics being (without reading this book). How did it all begin and where are we going are just some of the cosmic quandaries that are tackled. It even has a whole section on how many ways the planet and its life could end! Fun stuff for a nerd like me. Plus, it touches on many other science/culture conundrums that are great food for thought. It was a tiny redundant, owing to the fact that these are all previously written essays collected for purpose of the book. But, I actually liked the redundancy. It allowed more time for the heavy science behind astrophysics to sink in, and I became more familiar with the scientists that propelled our cosmic knowledge forward. Overall, it was a great read. It was a refreshing break from the day-to-day politics and tedium that can make our lives feel very small. From the advantage of science, it truly put our Earthly lives into a cosmic perspective."

He does spend a bit of time on the requisite bemoaning of popular innumeracy and scientific ignorance (fact: the sun is not yellow, and the time between sunrise and sunset is longer than 12 hours during either spring or autumn equinox), but most of the time he maintains a good sense of humor.Which he should, because modern astronomy has so many mind-bogglingly weird things to tell us that it's not as if he has to be stern or bombastic to have something interesting to say. Really, modern astrophysics has mind-bendingly counterintuitive things to tell us about space, time, the nature of the universe, and our place in it, and I know of no religion (orthodox or fringe) which is able to come close. These are people who speak earnestly and sanely with one another about whether or not there are 11 spatial dimensions, whether or not black holes can destroy information, and how the universe after 1/100th of a second differed from the universe after one millionth of a second. If he did not leaven this with earthly humor, it would seem to surreal to think on for long.“As a child, I knew that at night, with the lights out, infrared vision would discover monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded. Infrared vision would thus miss a bedroom monster completely because it would simply blend in with the walls and door.”This also gives one a hint of what kind of a child deGrasse Tyson was.DeGrasse Tyson is as fun to read as he is to listen to.

I've read too many other books on the subject, and while I praise deGrasse Tyson as both a teacher and a storyteller of the cosmos, I did not feel this collection of essays compared to the more robust information you get from the likes of Brian Greene, one of deGrasse Tyson's contemporaries. One of the author's instincts, I believe, is to over-inform on the unnecessary and quip on the most interesting, and in so doing, he loses not only his base...but in fact negates a base readership altogether. Don't discount it based on my opinion...it's good and if you haven't read much on the cosmos, this is a fair-to-decent launching point. That said, I didn't feel this broke any new barriers...perhaps just rehashed a few that I was already acquainted with. Anyway, this is one of those few 3-ratings I'd suggest, but ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene or ""The Theory of Everything"" by Hawking would always come recommended before it. "
154,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53373701-shoti,2,"I liked less this book than the other one I have read from Tyson, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution. This book is, in essence, a collection of articles which Tyson published in the National History magazine. There is nothing wrong with that concept by itself. At the same time, I do not think he managed to organize his essays into a coherent whole. Chapters or some parts of them are often repetitive, there is no logical story line, the author juggles too many topics – some of them are quite interesting while others are closer to a pop-culture-like depiction of astronomy. Finally, I normally enjoy when an acclaimed scientist seasons up his/her heavy stuff with a great dose of humor- there are plenty of great examples. In the case of this book though I felt that Tyson desperately tried to appear as the funniest astronomer of all times but his efforts often appeared more artificial than genuine."
155,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a wonderful writer, public speaker, and ceaseless defender of the necessity for science as something relevant in our culture and every essay in this book is a love letter to science. Each chapter, each essay explores a different avenue either of late scientific discoveries, personalities of famous scientists, or the role of science in popular culture. Even if you know nothing of science what's amazing about this book is the way Tyson makes the most esoteric or obscure ideas and concepts seem like something the layman could have a working understanding of. That, to me, is why the reader should read this book. Science is about human initiative and discovery, and what good is it if the culture that benefits from such science can't even understand it. Tyson makes quarks, astronomy, aliens, and even the ultimate death of the universe approachable and relevant. Wonderful book."
156,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82440-mike,2,"I really didn't like this book. I think my main problem is with the structure of the book, which just seemed to be a loose collection of loosely organized essays. The essays are not continuous and switch abruptly from one topic to another. I felt like the author just copied and pasted random past essays to create this book. As a result, I had a difficult time maintaining my interest in this book. It took me almost a month to force myself to finish, and that's only because when I got to less than 100 pages I was motivated to finish to just be able to move on.The only reason this book is getting two stars instead of one is because some of the individual essays were interesting on their own."

I felt I wanted a redo because a lot of what Hawking said went over my head. I was hoping deGrasse would be a better and he did deliver. He has the ability to break down complex science jargon for those who do not have a science background to understand. I commend him that ability because it must at times be frustrating.  Death by Black Hole was a really decent read and I did learn quite a bit from. I would recommend this book to others to read.

However, I did end up learning a lot because Dr. Tyson talks about a wide variety of topics. Additionally, he gives a plethora of interesting pieces of information that are perhaps unknown to many people (many depend on his own calculations).Moreover, being a collection of articles he had written did not affect the flow the book; I think the book was superbly edited."

It's all very informative and accessible, and each essay is short enough that it's not overwhelming.

169,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30391210-jeremy-borden,5,"Death by Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries, by Neil deGrasse Tyson, is a thrilling journey through the cosmos, from the tiniest of subatomic particles to the largest supermassive black holes. Although this book is primarily a fact-dispensing narrative, a cohesive storyline is not lost. Beginning with a discussion of knowledge itself, Tyson progresses to a description of the cosmos itself, the vast array of phenomena, the universal laws of physics, and how science has come to know and understand these things. He finishes the book with a conversation about the role of science in the modern world and how science interacts with culture and even with religion. Tyson does a great job of making very complex scenarios and processes understandable and easy to grasp. Even when he reaches a topic that could become boring, his humor and wit keep it interesting and entertaining. For example, Tyson explains that the universal laws of physics must remain constant wherever one travels. When Tyson ordered hot cocoa with whipped cream and the waiter asserted the whipped cream had sunk to the bottom, Tyson had an interesting response: “Since whipped cream has a very low density and floats on all liquids that humans consume, I offered the waiter two possible explanations: either somebody forgot to add the whipped cream to my hot cocoa or the universal laws of physics were different in his restaurant” (37). This passage, along with others, show just how engaged the author can keep his readers. Along with his humor, Tyson expresses his awe for the material he discusses. He is clearly humbled by the enormity of the universe and the extraordinary means by which so many pieces of the universe formed: “Yes, not only humans but also every other organism in the cosmos, as well as the planets or moons on which they thrive, would not exist but for the wreckage of spent stars. So you’re made of detritus. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?” (222). Overall, this book warrants little complaint. The author’s humor is wonderful and his excitement for his subject matter is admirable and contagious. The mysteries of the cosmos are explained in a way that makes it difficult not to feel a sense of awe and wonder. Some sections manage to get a little dense, but as long as the reader is interested in the material, these sections remain engaging. Lovers of science in general would enjoy this book. Furthermore, anyone interested in learning about the universe, space, and their phenomena should pick up this book since these topics are presented and explored. Realistically, anyone looking to expand his or her knowledge or looking for a good read could enjoy this book also because it is designed for a curious intellect. However, someone with little to no interest in the universe or cosmology should probably avoid this book as the subject matter could become boring. The section about science and religion is quite intriguing, but it may spark debate with some readers. Tyson provides his own opinions about religion and its relationship with science, expressing a relatively agnostic viewpoint about the divine. Readers with strong religious opinions may find this section to be controversial and as such, they may want to avoid this book or at least skip this section. Still for someone interested in the universe, regardless of religious belief, Tyson’s excellent book will not disappoint. Anyone who wonders about science and discovery should definitely read this tale of the cosmos. Personally, this book, in a way, satisfied my curiosity about the universe, and in a way, only served to spark more curiosity. I learned so much from reading this book, but it inspired me to learn more. My interest in the wonders of the universe was solidified. This was the first of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s books that I have read, but I assure you, he has gained an avid reader. "
170,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7404593-keith-moser,5,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. From his old Daily Show interviews to his recent Cosmos series, he's always seemed like a super cool, super intelligent guy. I bought Death by Black Hole back in early 2013, and it sat on my shelf ever since. I decided to finally pick it up and read it, and it wasn't as daunting as I had feared.Tyson is great at writing for the average man. Nothing in this book made me feel like I needed a PhD to grasp the concept. Everything was interesting.I have two complaints, but obviously nothing enough to drop it from 5 stars. First, I really wish there had been some diagrams. There were plenty of things that I've seen before and some things I haven't that I wish would have been included. I know all about Lagrange points but I would have liked to see them next to his description of them. I have no clue what art piece he's describing that has tree shadows falling in non-parallel lines, and I would have loved to see that. I can't remember any specific examples, but there were at least a dozen times I wanted a diagram.Also, the book is slightly worse because it seems (according to the back cover) that it's a collection of monthly ""Universe"" essays. You can tell that the book was edited because it constantly refers to other sections or adds ""as has been discussed,"" but honestly some of the repetitions were just so frequent it was annoying. Still, the range of topics, the depth of each one, and the overall writing was great. I think perhaps, this book would best be read one chapter every other week or every month to let the knowledge sink in, and keep the repetitions at bay."
171,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1551331-chris-white,5,"Absolutely wonderful, Tyson's boundless passion for science and astronomy come through in every sentence and while I'm rarely bored learning about the cosmos no one brings it to life quite like him.Getting the balance right on a book about science written to be accessible to a wide range of readers is a challenge, presumable even for such experienced educators but I found that it rarely was overly technical to the point that I lost a handle about what he was talking about nor did it feel too shallow to be interesting or consistently teach me new things throughout. One thing that really stood out to me was how often he went into detail about the history of science from speculation of the neolithic people through to what we know now; bringing the process and the practices of science into a broader context and giving us insight into how much we've learned and how much we undoubtably still have yet to discover. I particularly enjoyed his insights into the clashes of worldviews, theologies and politics and what roles they've played in science throughout our history. It underscores the need for an open mind and the importance of rejecting anti-science ideas in a time when it is so often derided and besieged.All of which is not to say that this wasn't a book about our universe first and foremost — it is — from discussions of gravity to the nature of light, the smallest of particles to the possibilities of a multiverse you will find science and reason throughout. And yes, death by black hole, galaxies colliding, extinction events and ultimately the seemingly inevitable fact that one day far from now even our universe will die as the last light goes dark, you'll get plenty of insight into how it could all end for us.Death by Black Hole never failed to leave me in wonderment over our existence and how much we still have yet to learn."

Each of Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson’s articles covers some aspect of the universe and our place within it. I’ve gotten in the habit of keeping a book like this next to my reading chair at all times. Over the last year, I read this collection of essays nice and slow, a chapter here and there. Not all prose needs to be edge of your seat to be worthwhile.Despite the ominous title, this book is not an unrelenting tirade about how the sky is falling, or rather being sucked into singular oblivion. Nor is it an all-out attack on traditional/prevailing beliefs. Death by Black Hole is actually full of wit and humor, irony and candidness. Dr. Tyson has an engaging conversational style, and he never misses a chance to tie science into everyday experience. Plus, I get the sense that his research humbles him as much as he hopes it will humble others.You need not agree with everything Tyson asserts. And you’d do well not to make his the only voice you put currency in. As he says in the chapter titled Life in the Universe, “Ordinarily, there is no riskier step that a scientist (or anyone) can take than to make sweeping generalizations from just one example.”Philosophical implications aside, Death by Black Hole is a great way to get to know the universe you live in better. Anyone who wants to be a good citizen needs to be conversant in science. If for no other reason than scientists--like all policy makers--need to be questioned constantly by the people who fund them.

My only frame of reference for this type of work is Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Grand Design"", which attempt to delve fairly deeply into the subject it discusses while still staying outside of the mathematics behind it all. Neil deGrasse Tyson may seem less substantial, but it is largely because he prefers to stick to what has been and what is with regard to the universe. With regard to black holes, whenever we travel into them it is characteristic of deGrasse Tyson's viewpoint that we die. A few brief questions center on what may happen out of the other side, but that is the type of speculation which delves so far outside of the consensus that I don't believe Tyson is very interested in dwelling on it. Don't worry - Tyson ignores the fact that we'd die at any number of points along the journey into the black hole to explore a treasure trove of fascinating details. The scientific consensus provides so many fascinating points to consider about the way our universe works that there is plenty here to enjoy, or refresh on if you've read other pop. science works."

When I realized I wasn't going to finish it in time for book club, I slowed down and started reading a chapter a night before going to bed. The chapters are just the right length - 4 to 5 pages - so you aren't overwhelmed with information, and then you have a whole day to mull it over (and the information is very mullable) before you tackle the next topic. I could feel myself getting smarter!*Neil de Grasse Tyson has a real gift for making complicated astrophysics accessible. The topics he chooses are fascinating, especially the section about the many ways the universe is out to get us (you did note the title, didn't you?). His final three chapters about religion and science are bound to ruffle a few feathers, but don't avoid this book on their account. * Results may vary.

And certainly the universe is full of things that can kill the fuck out of us. But the universe is incredibly interesting beyond the obvious negatives of cosmic death.Tyson really breaks apart concepts too complicated for me to explain into little chunks, allowing access for non-astrophysicists. I found his approach witty, interesting, and generally fun.This book is a 5 star book without reservation. You finish the book feeling as if you just sat through the physics class you were too terrified to take in college, but, instead of some professor who is out to give you Fs, your grandfather taught it.I would compare this book with Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", which also attacks the ivy-walled tradition in some science, making it accessible to us liberal arts majors."

There's a lot of history of science in it, as well as descriptions of the universe. It's diverse in what it covers, and yet it all is well bound up with science. If you liked Cosmos, give Death by Black Hole a read.Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist and is currently the director of the Hayden Planetarium and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. You may have seen him on any number of television shows, such as History Channel's ""The Universe,"" ""The Colbert Report"" and PBS's ""Nova Science Now,"" the latter of which he hosts. He is probably the leading science communicator of the day since Carl Sagan's death.

It's a series of essays on many different astronomical subjects that strike the fancy and border science fiction. Astronomy borders science fiction anyway in many cases, so there's even more ground for such forays than ""normal"".From what death by black hole would be like, as the title implies, to the zero-gravitational bowls of our cosmic neighbourhood, to an essay on light-pollution and another one on hollywood astonomy goofs, to the foundations of science, physics and astronomy themselves and their own problematics, to, to, to, and, and and! These are from the top of my head and I read the book more than 2 years ago.Neil deGrasse Tyson seems to be a talented populariser of his field, like Carl Sagan I believe, and I'd like to read more from him.

Personally, I felt that Tyson accomplished exactly what he set out to do in this prose: provide an accessible understanding of the cosmos at large. In general, the book is a very easy read. Some parts required a deeper understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum or black hole physics, but Tyson is a very accomplished explainer-of-things otherwise, particularly for his field of expertise: star creation and galaxy evolution. Many topics are repeated thoroughly throughout the some 40 chapters, sometimes nearly word-for-word. Tyson is unabashedly an Americanist in his view of science. I leave a star absent because of his no-holds-barred attitude toward ""ancients"" and non-""civilizations"", providing little recognition of the possibility that other humans could have come to similar conclusions throughout history that needn't lived in the ""Northern"" or ""Western hemispheres"". Tyson's work is colonizing, in this way."

The author's enthusiasm for all things cosmic comes shining through in this book. As a person that has a passing interest in black holes, quasar and other stuff like that. This book provides a great crash course in all things spacey. I now feel a little bit smarter but I am also now in awe of the scientist t past and present that seek to unravel the secrets of our universe. The book is cut up nicely into sections dealing with individual subjects. I did find it a tad annoying that the authors amusing explanations of certain things repeated throughout the book. This to me tarnished this otherwise great read. I particularly liked how he pulled apart common misconceptions like the sun rises in the east and set in the west. Overall this is science delivered in a way us commoners can understand without dumbing it down too much. As for the title I for one am not in favour of meeting my end this way."

He does spend a bit of time on the requisite bemoaning of popular innumeracy and scientific ignorance (fact: the sun is not yellow, and the time between sunrise and sunset is longer than 12 hours during either spring or autumn equinox), but most of the time he maintains a good sense of humor.Which he should, because modern astronomy has so many mind-bogglingly weird things to tell us that it's not as if he has to be stern or bombastic to have something interesting to say. Really, modern astrophysics has mind-bendingly counterintuitive things to tell us about space, time, the nature of the universe, and our place in it, and I know of no religion (orthodox or fringe) which is able to come close. These are people who speak earnestly and sanely with one another about whether or not there are 11 spatial dimensions, whether or not black holes can destroy information, and how the universe after 1/100th of a second differed from the universe after one millionth of a second. If he did not leaven this with earthly humor, it would seem to surreal to think on for long.“As a child, I knew that at night, with the lights out, infrared vision would discover monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded. Infrared vision would thus miss a bedroom monster completely because it would simply blend in with the walls and door.”This also gives one a hint of what kind of a child deGrasse Tyson was.DeGrasse Tyson is as fun to read as he is to listen to. Recommended."
183,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2084139-bryce-holt,3,"Gah, I suffered from the worst malady a reader can have while making my way through the audio version of this - disenchantment. I've read too many other books on the subject, and while I praise deGrasse Tyson as both a teacher and a storyteller of the cosmos, I did not feel this collection of essays compared to the more robust information you get from the likes of Brian Greene, one of deGrasse Tyson's contemporaries. One of the author's instincts, I believe, is to over-inform on the unnecessary and quip on the most interesting, and in so doing, he loses not only his base...but in fact negates a base readership altogether. Don't discount it based on my opinion...it's good and if you haven't read much on the cosmos, this is a fair-to-decent launching point. That said, I didn't feel this broke any new barriers...perhaps just rehashed a few that I was already acquainted with. Anyway, this is one of those few 3-ratings I'd suggest, but ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene or ""The Theory of Everything"" by Hawking would always come recommended before it. "
184,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53373701-shoti,2,"I liked less this book than the other one I have read from Tyson, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution. This book is, in essence, a collection of articles which Tyson published in the National History magazine. There is nothing wrong with that concept by itself. At the same time, I do not think he managed to organize his essays into a coherent whole. Chapters or some parts of them are often repetitive, there is no logical story line, the author juggles too many topics – some of them are quite interesting while others are closer to a pop-culture-like depiction of astronomy. Finally, I normally enjoy when an acclaimed scientist seasons up his/her heavy stuff with a great dose of humor- there are plenty of great examples. In the case of this book though I felt that Tyson desperately tried to appear as the funniest astronomer of all times but his efforts often appeared more artificial than genuine."
185,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a wonderful writer, public speaker, and ceaseless defender of the necessity for science as something relevant in our culture and every essay in this book is a love letter to science. Each chapter, each essay explores a different avenue either of late scientific discoveries, personalities of famous scientists, or the role of science in popular culture. Even if you know nothing of science what's amazing about this book is the way Tyson makes the most esoteric or obscure ideas and concepts seem like something the layman could have a working understanding of. That, to me, is why the reader should read this book. Science is about human initiative and discovery, and what good is it if the culture that benefits from such science can't even understand it. Tyson makes quarks, astronomy, aliens, and even the ultimate death of the universe approachable and relevant. Wonderful book."
186,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82440-mike,2,"I really didn't like this book. I think my main problem is with the structure of the book, which just seemed to be a loose collection of loosely organized essays. The essays are not continuous and switch abruptly from one topic to another. I felt like the author just copied and pasted random past essays to create this book. As a result, I had a difficult time maintaining my interest in this book. It took me almost a month to force myself to finish, and that's only because when I got to less than 100 pages I was motivated to finish to just be able to move on.The only reason this book is getting two stars instead of one is because some of the individual essays were interesting on their own."

I felt I wanted a redo because a lot of what Hawking said went over my head. I was hoping deGrasse would be a better and he did deliver. He has the ability to break down complex science jargon for those who do not have a science background to understand. I commend him that ability because it must at times be frustrating.  Death by Black Hole was a really decent read and I did learn quite a bit from. I would recommend this book to others to read.

However, I did end up learning a lot because Dr. Tyson talks about a wide variety of topics. Additionally, he gives a plethora of interesting pieces of information that are perhaps unknown to many people (many depend on his own calculations).Moreover, being a collection of articles he had written did not affect the flow the book; I think the book was superbly edited."

It's all very informative and accessible, and each essay is short enough that it's not overwhelming.

199,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30391210-jeremy-borden,5,"Death by Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries, by Neil deGrasse Tyson, is a thrilling journey through the cosmos, from the tiniest of subatomic particles to the largest supermassive black holes. Although this book is primarily a fact-dispensing narrative, a cohesive storyline is not lost. Beginning with a discussion of knowledge itself, Tyson progresses to a description of the cosmos itself, the vast array of phenomena, the universal laws of physics, and how science has come to know and understand these things. He finishes the book with a conversation about the role of science in the modern world and how science interacts with culture and even with religion. Tyson does a great job of making very complex scenarios and processes understandable and easy to grasp. Even when he reaches a topic that could become boring, his humor and wit keep it interesting and entertaining. For example, Tyson explains that the universal laws of physics must remain constant wherever one travels. When Tyson ordered hot cocoa with whipped cream and the waiter asserted the whipped cream had sunk to the bottom, Tyson had an interesting response: “Since whipped cream has a very low density and floats on all liquids that humans consume, I offered the waiter two possible explanations: either somebody forgot to add the whipped cream to my hot cocoa or the universal laws of physics were different in his restaurant” (37). This passage, along with others, show just how engaged the author can keep his readers. Along with his humor, Tyson expresses his awe for the material he discusses. He is clearly humbled by the enormity of the universe and the extraordinary means by which so many pieces of the universe formed: “Yes, not only humans but also every other organism in the cosmos, as well as the planets or moons on which they thrive, would not exist but for the wreckage of spent stars. So you’re made of detritus. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?” (222). Overall, this book warrants little complaint. The author’s humor is wonderful and his excitement for his subject matter is admirable and contagious. The mysteries of the cosmos are explained in a way that makes it difficult not to feel a sense of awe and wonder. Some sections manage to get a little dense, but as long as the reader is interested in the material, these sections remain engaging. Lovers of science in general would enjoy this book. Furthermore, anyone interested in learning about the universe, space, and their phenomena should pick up this book since these topics are presented and explored. Realistically, anyone looking to expand his or her knowledge or looking for a good read could enjoy this book also because it is designed for a curious intellect. However, someone with little to no interest in the universe or cosmology should probably avoid this book as the subject matter could become boring. The section about science and religion is quite intriguing, but it may spark debate with some readers. Tyson provides his own opinions about religion and its relationship with science, expressing a relatively agnostic viewpoint about the divine. Readers with strong religious opinions may find this section to be controversial and as such, they may want to avoid this book or at least skip this section. Still for someone interested in the universe, regardless of religious belief, Tyson’s excellent book will not disappoint. Anyone who wonders about science and discovery should definitely read this tale of the cosmos. Personally, this book, in a way, satisfied my curiosity about the universe, and in a way, only served to spark more curiosity. I learned so much from reading this book, but it inspired me to learn more. My interest in the wonders of the universe was solidified. This was the first of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s books that I have read, but I assure you, he has gained an avid reader. "
200,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7404593-keith-moser,5,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. From his old Daily Show interviews to his recent Cosmos series, he's always seemed like a super cool, super intelligent guy. I bought Death by Black Hole back in early 2013, and it sat on my shelf ever since. I decided to finally pick it up and read it, and it wasn't as daunting as I had feared.Tyson is great at writing for the average man. Nothing in this book made me feel like I needed a PhD to grasp the concept. Everything was interesting.I have two complaints, but obviously nothing enough to drop it from 5 stars. First, I really wish there had been some diagrams. There were plenty of things that I've seen before and some things I haven't that I wish would have been included. I know all about Lagrange points but I would have liked to see them next to his description of them. I have no clue what art piece he's describing that has tree shadows falling in non-parallel lines, and I would have loved to see that. I can't remember any specific examples, but there were at least a dozen times I wanted a diagram.Also, the book is slightly worse because it seems (according to the back cover) that it's a collection of monthly ""Universe"" essays. You can tell that the book was edited because it constantly refers to other sections or adds ""as has been discussed,"" but honestly some of the repetitions were just so frequent it was annoying. Still, the range of topics, the depth of each one, and the overall writing was great. I think perhaps, this book would best be read one chapter every other week or every month to let the knowledge sink in, and keep the repetitions at bay."

One thing that really stood out to me was how often he went into detail about the history of science from speculation of the neolithic people through to what we know now; bringing the process and the practices of science into a broader context and giving us insight into how much we've learned and how much we undoubtably still have yet to discover.

I could feel myself getting smarter!*Neil de Grasse Tyson has a real gift for making complicated astrophysics accessible. The topics he chooses are fascinating, especially the section about the many ways the universe is out to get us (you did note the title, didn't you?). His final three chapters about religion and science are bound to ruffle a few feathers, but don't avoid this book on their account. * Results may vary. These statements have not been reviewed by Neil deGrasse Tyson or anyone that is REALLY smart."

Some parts required a deeper understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum or black hole physics, but Tyson is a very accomplished explainer-of-things otherwise, particularly for his field of expertise: star creation and galaxy evolution. Many topics are repeated thoroughly throughout the some 40 chapters, sometimes nearly word-for-word. Tyson is unabashedly an Americanist in his view of science. I leave a star absent because of his no-holds-barred attitude toward ""ancients"" and non-""civilizations"", providing little recognition of the possibility that other humans could have come to similar conclusions throughout history that needn't lived in the ""Northern"" or ""Western hemispheres"". Tyson's work is colonizing, in this way."

The author's enthusiasm for all things cosmic comes shining through in this book. As a person that has a passing interest in black holes, quasar and other stuff like that. This book provides a great crash course in all things spacey. I now feel a little bit smarter but I am also now in awe of the scientist t past and present that seek to unravel the secrets of our universe. The book is cut up nicely into sections dealing with individual subjects. I did find it a tad annoying that the authors amusing explanations of certain things repeated throughout the book. This to me tarnished this otherwise great read. I particularly liked how he pulled apart common misconceptions like the sun rises in the east and set in the west. Overall this is science delivered in a way us commoners can understand without dumbing it down too much. As for the title I for one am not in favour of meeting my end this way."

He does spend a bit of time on the requisite bemoaning of popular innumeracy and scientific ignorance (fact: the sun is not yellow, and the time between sunrise and sunset is longer than 12 hours during either spring or autumn equinox), but most of the time he maintains a good sense of humor.Which he should, because modern astronomy has so many mind-bogglingly weird things to tell us that it's not as if he has to be stern or bombastic to have something interesting to say. Really, modern astrophysics has mind-bendingly counterintuitive things to tell us about space, time, the nature of the universe, and our place in it, and I know of no religion (orthodox or fringe) which is able to come close. These are people who speak earnestly and sanely with one another about whether or not there are 11 spatial dimensions, whether or not black holes can destroy information, and how the universe after 1/100th of a second differed from the universe after one millionth of a second. If he did not leaven this with earthly humor, it would seem to surreal to think on for long.“As a child, I knew that at night, with the lights out, infrared vision would discover monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded. Infrared vision would thus miss a bedroom monster completely because it would simply blend in with the walls and door.”This also gives one a hint of what kind of a child deGrasse Tyson was.DeGrasse Tyson is as fun to read as he is to listen to.

213,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2084139-bryce-holt,3,"Gah, I suffered from the worst malady a reader can have while making my way through the audio version of this - disenchantment. I've read too many other books on the subject, and while I praise deGrasse Tyson as both a teacher and a storyteller of the cosmos, I did not feel this collection of essays compared to the more robust information you get from the likes of Brian Greene, one of deGrasse Tyson's contemporaries. One of the author's instincts, I believe, is to over-inform on the unnecessary and quip on the most interesting, and in so doing, he loses not only his base...but in fact negates a base readership altogether. Don't discount it based on my opinion...it's good and if you haven't read much on the cosmos, this is a fair-to-decent launching point. That said, I didn't feel this broke any new barriers...perhaps just rehashed a few that I was already acquainted with. Anyway, this is one of those few 3-ratings I'd suggest, but ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene or ""The Theory of Everything"" by Hawking would always come recommended before it. "
214,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53373701-shoti,2,"I liked less this book than the other one I have read from Tyson, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution. This book is, in essence, a collection of articles which Tyson published in the National History magazine. There is nothing wrong with that concept by itself. At the same time, I do not think he managed to organize his essays into a coherent whole. Chapters or some parts of them are often repetitive, there is no logical story line, the author juggles too many topics – some of them are quite interesting while others are closer to a pop-culture-like depiction of astronomy. Finally, I normally enjoy when an acclaimed scientist seasons up his/her heavy stuff with a great dose of humor- there are plenty of great examples. In the case of this book though I felt that Tyson desperately tried to appear as the funniest astronomer of all times but his efforts often appeared more artificial than genuine."
215,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a wonderful writer, public speaker, and ceaseless defender of the necessity for science as something relevant in our culture and every essay in this book is a love letter to science. Each chapter, each essay explores a different avenue either of late scientific discoveries, personalities of famous scientists, or the role of science in popular culture. Even if you know nothing of science what's amazing about this book is the way Tyson makes the most esoteric or obscure ideas and concepts seem like something the layman could have a working understanding of. That, to me, is why the reader should read this book. Science is about human initiative and discovery, and what good is it if the culture that benefits from such science can't even understand it. Tyson makes quarks, astronomy, aliens, and even the ultimate death of the universe approachable and relevant. Wonderful book."
216,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82440-mike,2,"I really didn't like this book. I think my main problem is with the structure of the book, which just seemed to be a loose collection of loosely organized essays. The essays are not continuous and switch abruptly from one topic to another. I felt like the author just copied and pasted random past essays to create this book. As a result, I had a difficult time maintaining my interest in this book. It took me almost a month to force myself to finish, and that's only because when I got to less than 100 pages I was motivated to finish to just be able to move on.The only reason this book is getting two stars instead of one is because some of the individual essays were interesting on their own."

I felt I wanted a redo because a lot of what Hawking said went over my head. I was hoping deGrasse would be a better and he did deliver. He has the ability to break down complex science jargon for those who do not have a science background to understand. I commend him that ability because it must at times be frustrating.  Death by Black Hole was a really decent read and I did learn quite a bit from. I would recommend this book to others to read.

However, I did end up learning a lot because Dr. Tyson talks about a wide variety of topics. Additionally, he gives a plethora of interesting pieces of information that are perhaps unknown to many people (many depend on his own calculations).Moreover, being a collection of articles he had written did not affect the flow the book; I think the book was superbly edited."

229,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30391210-jeremy-borden,5,"Death by Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries, by Neil deGrasse Tyson, is a thrilling journey through the cosmos, from the tiniest of subatomic particles to the largest supermassive black holes. Although this book is primarily a fact-dispensing narrative, a cohesive storyline is not lost. Beginning with a discussion of knowledge itself, Tyson progresses to a description of the cosmos itself, the vast array of phenomena, the universal laws of physics, and how science has come to know and understand these things. He finishes the book with a conversation about the role of science in the modern world and how science interacts with culture and even with religion. Tyson does a great job of making very complex scenarios and processes understandable and easy to grasp. Even when he reaches a topic that could become boring, his humor and wit keep it interesting and entertaining. For example, Tyson explains that the universal laws of physics must remain constant wherever one travels. When Tyson ordered hot cocoa with whipped cream and the waiter asserted the whipped cream had sunk to the bottom, Tyson had an interesting response: “Since whipped cream has a very low density and floats on all liquids that humans consume, I offered the waiter two possible explanations: either somebody forgot to add the whipped cream to my hot cocoa or the universal laws of physics were different in his restaurant” (37). This passage, along with others, show just how engaged the author can keep his readers. Along with his humor, Tyson expresses his awe for the material he discusses. He is clearly humbled by the enormity of the universe and the extraordinary means by which so many pieces of the universe formed: “Yes, not only humans but also every other organism in the cosmos, as well as the planets or moons on which they thrive, would not exist but for the wreckage of spent stars. So you’re made of detritus. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?” (222). Overall, this book warrants little complaint. The author’s humor is wonderful and his excitement for his subject matter is admirable and contagious. The mysteries of the cosmos are explained in a way that makes it difficult not to feel a sense of awe and wonder. Some sections manage to get a little dense, but as long as the reader is interested in the material, these sections remain engaging. Lovers of science in general would enjoy this book. Furthermore, anyone interested in learning about the universe, space, and their phenomena should pick up this book since these topics are presented and explored. Realistically, anyone looking to expand his or her knowledge or looking for a good read could enjoy this book also because it is designed for a curious intellect. However, someone with little to no interest in the universe or cosmology should probably avoid this book as the subject matter could become boring. The section about science and religion is quite intriguing, but it may spark debate with some readers. Tyson provides his own opinions about religion and its relationship with science, expressing a relatively agnostic viewpoint about the divine. Readers with strong religious opinions may find this section to be controversial and as such, they may want to avoid this book or at least skip this section. Still for someone interested in the universe, regardless of religious belief, Tyson’s excellent book will not disappoint. Anyone who wonders about science and discovery should definitely read this tale of the cosmos. Personally, this book, in a way, satisfied my curiosity about the universe, and in a way, only served to spark more curiosity. I learned so much from reading this book, but it inspired me to learn more. My interest in the wonders of the universe was solidified. This was the first of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s books that I have read, but I assure you, he has gained an avid reader. "
230,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7404593-keith-moser,5,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. From his old Daily Show interviews to his recent Cosmos series, he's always seemed like a super cool, super intelligent guy. I bought Death by Black Hole back in early 2013, and it sat on my shelf ever since. I decided to finally pick it up and read it, and it wasn't as daunting as I had feared.Tyson is great at writing for the average man. Nothing in this book made me feel like I needed a PhD to grasp the concept. Everything was interesting.I have two complaints, but obviously nothing enough to drop it from 5 stars. First, I really wish there had been some diagrams. There were plenty of things that I've seen before and some things I haven't that I wish would have been included. I know all about Lagrange points but I would have liked to see them next to his description of them. I have no clue what art piece he's describing that has tree shadows falling in non-parallel lines, and I would have loved to see that. I can't remember any specific examples, but there were at least a dozen times I wanted a diagram.Also, the book is slightly worse because it seems (according to the back cover) that it's a collection of monthly ""Universe"" essays. You can tell that the book was edited because it constantly refers to other sections or adds ""as has been discussed,"" but honestly some of the repetitions were just so frequent it was annoying. Still, the range of topics, the depth of each one, and the overall writing was great. I think perhaps, this book would best be read one chapter every other week or every month to let the knowledge sink in, and keep the repetitions at bay."
231,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1551331-chris-white,5,"Absolutely wonderful, Tyson's boundless passion for science and astronomy come through in every sentence and while I'm rarely bored learning about the cosmos no one brings it to life quite like him.Getting the balance right on a book about science written to be accessible to a wide range of readers is a challenge, presumable even for such experienced educators but I found that it rarely was overly technical to the point that I lost a handle about what he was talking about nor did it feel too shallow to be interesting or consistently teach me new things throughout. One thing that really stood out to me was how often he went into detail about the history of science from speculation of the neolithic people through to what we know now; bringing the process and the practices of science into a broader context and giving us insight into how much we've learned and how much we undoubtably still have yet to discover. I particularly enjoyed his insights into the clashes of worldviews, theologies and politics and what roles they've played in science throughout our history. It underscores the need for an open mind and the importance of rejecting anti-science ideas in a time when it is so often derided and besieged.All of which is not to say that this wasn't a book about our universe first and foremost — it is — from discussions of gravity to the nature of light, the smallest of particles to the possibilities of a multiverse you will find science and reason throughout. And yes, death by black hole, galaxies colliding, extinction events and ultimately the seemingly inevitable fact that one day far from now even our universe will die as the last light goes dark, you'll get plenty of insight into how it could all end for us.Death by Black Hole never failed to leave me in wonderment over our existence and how much we still have yet to learn."
232,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1995871-jake,5,"“The remarkable feature of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them.”That is one of many gems I underlined during my reading of Death by Black Hole. Each of Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson’s articles covers some aspect of the universe and our place within it. I’ve gotten in the habit of keeping a book like this next to my reading chair at all times. Over the last year, I read this collection of essays nice and slow, a chapter here and there. Not all prose needs to be edge of your seat to be worthwhile.Despite the ominous title, this book is not an unrelenting tirade about how the sky is falling, or rather being sucked into singular oblivion. Nor is it an all-out attack on traditional/prevailing beliefs. Death by Black Hole is actually full of wit and humor, irony and candidness. Dr. Tyson has an engaging conversational style, and he never misses a chance to tie science into everyday experience. Plus, I get the sense that his research humbles him as much as he hopes it will humble others.You need not agree with everything Tyson asserts. And you’d do well not to make his the only voice you put currency in. As he says in the chapter titled Life in the Universe, “Ordinarily, there is no riskier step that a scientist (or anyone) can take than to make sweeping generalizations from just one example.”Philosophical implications aside, Death by Black Hole is a great way to get to know the universe you live in better. Anyone who wants to be a good citizen needs to be conversant in science. If for no other reason than scientists--like all policy makers--need to be questioned constantly by the people who fund them. "
233,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8083390-a,4,"A general and very interesting look at how our fascinating universe works. My only frame of reference for this type of work is Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Grand Design"", which attempt to delve fairly deeply into the subject it discusses while still staying outside of the mathematics behind it all. Neil deGrasse Tyson may seem less substantial, but it is largely because he prefers to stick to what has been and what is with regard to the universe. With regard to black holes, whenever we travel into them it is characteristic of deGrasse Tyson's viewpoint that we die. A few brief questions center on what may happen out of the other side, but that is the type of speculation which delves so far outside of the consensus that I don't believe Tyson is very interested in dwelling on it. Don't worry - Tyson ignores the fact that we'd die at any number of points along the journey into the black hole to explore a treasure trove of fascinating details. The scientific consensus provides so many fascinating points to consider about the way our universe works that there is plenty here to enjoy, or refresh on if you've read other pop. science works."

Many topics are repeated thoroughly throughout the some 40 chapters, sometimes nearly word-for-word. Tyson is unabashedly an Americanist in his view of science. I leave a star absent because of his no-holds-barred attitude toward ""ancients"" and non-""civilizations"", providing little recognition of the possibility that other humans could have come to similar conclusions throughout history that needn't lived in the ""Northern"" or ""Western hemispheres"". Tyson's work is colonizing, in this way."

I now feel a little bit smarter but I am also now in awe of the scientist t past and present that seek to unravel the secrets of our universe. The book is cut up nicely into sections dealing with individual subjects. I did find it a tad annoying that the authors amusing explanations of certain things repeated throughout the book. This to me tarnished this otherwise great read. I particularly liked how he pulled apart common misconceptions like the sun rises in the east and set in the west.

He does spend a bit of time on the requisite bemoaning of popular innumeracy and scientific ignorance (fact: the sun is not yellow, and the time between sunrise and sunset is longer than 12 hours during either spring or autumn equinox), but most of the time he maintains a good sense of humor.Which he should, because modern astronomy has so many mind-bogglingly weird things to tell us that it's not as if he has to be stern or bombastic to have something interesting to say. Really, modern astrophysics has mind-bendingly counterintuitive things to tell us about space, time, the nature of the universe, and our place in it, and I know of no religion (orthodox or fringe) which is able to come close. These are people who speak earnestly and sanely with one another about whether or not there are 11 spatial dimensions, whether or not black holes can destroy information, and how the universe after 1/100th of a second differed from the universe after one millionth of a second. If he did not leaven this with earthly humor, it would seem to surreal to think on for long.“As a child, I knew that at night, with the lights out, infrared vision would discover monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded. Infrared vision would thus miss a bedroom monster completely because it would simply blend in with the walls and door.”This also gives one a hint of what kind of a child deGrasse Tyson was.DeGrasse Tyson is as fun to read as he is to listen to.

I've read too many other books on the subject, and while I praise deGrasse Tyson as both a teacher and a storyteller of the cosmos, I did not feel this collection of essays compared to the more robust information you get from the likes of Brian Greene, one of deGrasse Tyson's contemporaries. One of the author's instincts, I believe, is to over-inform on the unnecessary and quip on the most interesting, and in so doing, he loses not only his base...but in fact negates a base readership altogether. Don't discount it based on my opinion...it's good and if you haven't read much on the cosmos, this is a fair-to-decent launching point. That said, I didn't feel this broke any new barriers...perhaps just rehashed a few that I was already acquainted with. Anyway, this is one of those few 3-ratings I'd suggest, but ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene or ""The Theory of Everything"" by Hawking would always come recommended before it. "

This book is, in essence, a collection of articles which Tyson published in the National History magazine. There is nothing wrong with that concept by itself. At the same time, I do not think he managed to organize his essays into a coherent whole. Chapters or some parts of them are often repetitive, there is no logical story line, the author juggles too many topics – some of them are quite interesting while others are closer to a pop-culture-like depiction of astronomy. Finally, I normally enjoy when an acclaimed scientist seasons up his/her heavy stuff with a great dose of humor- there are plenty of great examples. In the case of this book though I felt that Tyson desperately tried to appear as the funniest astronomer of all times but his efforts often appeared more artificial than genuine."
245,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a wonderful writer, public speaker, and ceaseless defender of the necessity for science as something relevant in our culture and every essay in this book is a love letter to science. Each chapter, each essay explores a different avenue either of late scientific discoveries, personalities of famous scientists, or the role of science in popular culture. Even if you know nothing of science what's amazing about this book is the way Tyson makes the most esoteric or obscure ideas and concepts seem like something the layman could have a working understanding of. That, to me, is why the reader should read this book. Science is about human initiative and discovery, and what good is it if the culture that benefits from such science can't even understand it. Tyson makes quarks, astronomy, aliens, and even the ultimate death of the universe approachable and relevant. Wonderful book."

I think my main problem is with the structure of the book, which just seemed to be a loose collection of loosely organized essays. The essays are not continuous and switch abruptly from one topic to another. I felt like the author just copied and pasted random past essays to create this book. As a result, I had a difficult time maintaining my interest in this book. It took me almost a month to force myself to finish, and that's only because when I got to less than 100 pages I was motivated to finish to just be able to move on.The only reason this book is getting two stars instead of one is because some of the individual essays were interesting on their own."

I felt I wanted a redo because a lot of what Hawking said went over my head. I was hoping deGrasse would be a better and he did deliver. He has the ability to break down complex science jargon for those who do not have a science background to understand. I commend him that ability because it must at times be frustrating.  Death by Black Hole was a really decent read and I did learn quite a bit from. I would recommend this book to others to read.

However, I did end up learning a lot because Dr. Tyson talks about a wide variety of topics. Additionally, he gives a plethora of interesting pieces of information that are perhaps unknown to many people (many depend on his own calculations).Moreover, being a collection of articles he had written did not affect the flow the book; I think the book was superbly edited."

It's all very informative and accessible, and each essay is short enough that it's not overwhelming.

259,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30391210-jeremy-borden,5,"Death by Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries, by Neil deGrasse Tyson, is a thrilling journey through the cosmos, from the tiniest of subatomic particles to the largest supermassive black holes. Although this book is primarily a fact-dispensing narrative, a cohesive storyline is not lost. Beginning with a discussion of knowledge itself, Tyson progresses to a description of the cosmos itself, the vast array of phenomena, the universal laws of physics, and how science has come to know and understand these things. He finishes the book with a conversation about the role of science in the modern world and how science interacts with culture and even with religion. Tyson does a great job of making very complex scenarios and processes understandable and easy to grasp. Even when he reaches a topic that could become boring, his humor and wit keep it interesting and entertaining. For example, Tyson explains that the universal laws of physics must remain constant wherever one travels. When Tyson ordered hot cocoa with whipped cream and the waiter asserted the whipped cream had sunk to the bottom, Tyson had an interesting response: “Since whipped cream has a very low density and floats on all liquids that humans consume, I offered the waiter two possible explanations: either somebody forgot to add the whipped cream to my hot cocoa or the universal laws of physics were different in his restaurant” (37). This passage, along with others, show just how engaged the author can keep his readers. Along with his humor, Tyson expresses his awe for the material he discusses. He is clearly humbled by the enormity of the universe and the extraordinary means by which so many pieces of the universe formed: “Yes, not only humans but also every other organism in the cosmos, as well as the planets or moons on which they thrive, would not exist but for the wreckage of spent stars. So you’re made of detritus. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?” (222). Overall, this book warrants little complaint. The author’s humor is wonderful and his excitement for his subject matter is admirable and contagious. The mysteries of the cosmos are explained in a way that makes it difficult not to feel a sense of awe and wonder. Some sections manage to get a little dense, but as long as the reader is interested in the material, these sections remain engaging. Lovers of science in general would enjoy this book. Furthermore, anyone interested in learning about the universe, space, and their phenomena should pick up this book since these topics are presented and explored. Realistically, anyone looking to expand his or her knowledge or looking for a good read could enjoy this book also because it is designed for a curious intellect. However, someone with little to no interest in the universe or cosmology should probably avoid this book as the subject matter could become boring. The section about science and religion is quite intriguing, but it may spark debate with some readers. Tyson provides his own opinions about religion and its relationship with science, expressing a relatively agnostic viewpoint about the divine. Readers with strong religious opinions may find this section to be controversial and as such, they may want to avoid this book or at least skip this section. Still for someone interested in the universe, regardless of religious belief, Tyson’s excellent book will not disappoint. Anyone who wonders about science and discovery should definitely read this tale of the cosmos. Personally, this book, in a way, satisfied my curiosity about the universe, and in a way, only served to spark more curiosity. I learned so much from reading this book, but it inspired me to learn more. My interest in the wonders of the universe was solidified. This was the first of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s books that I have read, but I assure you, he has gained an avid reader. "
260,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7404593-keith-moser,5,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. From his old Daily Show interviews to his recent Cosmos series, he's always seemed like a super cool, super intelligent guy. I bought Death by Black Hole back in early 2013, and it sat on my shelf ever since. I decided to finally pick it up and read it, and it wasn't as daunting as I had feared.Tyson is great at writing for the average man. Nothing in this book made me feel like I needed a PhD to grasp the concept. Everything was interesting.I have two complaints, but obviously nothing enough to drop it from 5 stars. First, I really wish there had been some diagrams. There were plenty of things that I've seen before and some things I haven't that I wish would have been included. I know all about Lagrange points but I would have liked to see them next to his description of them. I have no clue what art piece he's describing that has tree shadows falling in non-parallel lines, and I would have loved to see that. I can't remember any specific examples, but there were at least a dozen times I wanted a diagram.Also, the book is slightly worse because it seems (according to the back cover) that it's a collection of monthly ""Universe"" essays. You can tell that the book was edited because it constantly refers to other sections or adds ""as has been discussed,"" but honestly some of the repetitions were just so frequent it was annoying. Still, the range of topics, the depth of each one, and the overall writing was great. I think perhaps, this book would best be read one chapter every other week or every month to let the knowledge sink in, and keep the repetitions at bay."
261,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1551331-chris-white,5,"Absolutely wonderful, Tyson's boundless passion for science and astronomy come through in every sentence and while I'm rarely bored learning about the cosmos no one brings it to life quite like him.Getting the balance right on a book about science written to be accessible to a wide range of readers is a challenge, presumable even for such experienced educators but I found that it rarely was overly technical to the point that I lost a handle about what he was talking about nor did it feel too shallow to be interesting or consistently teach me new things throughout. One thing that really stood out to me was how often he went into detail about the history of science from speculation of the neolithic people through to what we know now; bringing the process and the practices of science into a broader context and giving us insight into how much we've learned and how much we undoubtably still have yet to discover. I particularly enjoyed his insights into the clashes of worldviews, theologies and politics and what roles they've played in science throughout our history. It underscores the need for an open mind and the importance of rejecting anti-science ideas in a time when it is so often derided and besieged.All of which is not to say that this wasn't a book about our universe first and foremost — it is — from discussions of gravity to the nature of light, the smallest of particles to the possibilities of a multiverse you will find science and reason throughout. And yes, death by black hole, galaxies colliding, extinction events and ultimately the seemingly inevitable fact that one day far from now even our universe will die as the last light goes dark, you'll get plenty of insight into how it could all end for us.Death by Black Hole never failed to leave me in wonderment over our existence and how much we still have yet to learn."
262,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1995871-jake,5,"“The remarkable feature of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them.”That is one of many gems I underlined during my reading of Death by Black Hole. Each of Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson’s articles covers some aspect of the universe and our place within it. I’ve gotten in the habit of keeping a book like this next to my reading chair at all times. Over the last year, I read this collection of essays nice and slow, a chapter here and there. Not all prose needs to be edge of your seat to be worthwhile.Despite the ominous title, this book is not an unrelenting tirade about how the sky is falling, or rather being sucked into singular oblivion. Nor is it an all-out attack on traditional/prevailing beliefs. Death by Black Hole is actually full of wit and humor, irony and candidness. Dr. Tyson has an engaging conversational style, and he never misses a chance to tie science into everyday experience. Plus, I get the sense that his research humbles him as much as he hopes it will humble others.You need not agree with everything Tyson asserts. And you’d do well not to make his the only voice you put currency in. As he says in the chapter titled Life in the Universe, “Ordinarily, there is no riskier step that a scientist (or anyone) can take than to make sweeping generalizations from just one example.”Philosophical implications aside, Death by Black Hole is a great way to get to know the universe you live in better. Anyone who wants to be a good citizen needs to be conversant in science. If for no other reason than scientists--like all policy makers--need to be questioned constantly by the people who fund them. "
263,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8083390-a,4,"A general and very interesting look at how our fascinating universe works. My only frame of reference for this type of work is Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Grand Design"", which attempt to delve fairly deeply into the subject it discusses while still staying outside of the mathematics behind it all. Neil deGrasse Tyson may seem less substantial, but it is largely because he prefers to stick to what has been and what is with regard to the universe. With regard to black holes, whenever we travel into them it is characteristic of deGrasse Tyson's viewpoint that we die. A few brief questions center on what may happen out of the other side, but that is the type of speculation which delves so far outside of the consensus that I don't believe Tyson is very interested in dwelling on it. Don't worry - Tyson ignores the fact that we'd die at any number of points along the journey into the black hole to explore a treasure trove of fascinating details. The scientific consensus provides so many fascinating points to consider about the way our universe works that there is plenty here to enjoy, or refresh on if you've read other pop. science works."
264,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,4,"It took me over two months to read this book, but I think reading this book slowly is the perfect way to enjoy it. When I realized I wasn't going to finish it in time for book club, I slowed down and started reading a chapter a night before going to bed. The chapters are just the right length - 4 to 5 pages - so you aren't overwhelmed with information, and then you have a whole day to mull it over (and the information is very mullable) before you tackle the next topic. I could feel myself getting smarter!*Neil de Grasse Tyson has a real gift for making complicated astrophysics accessible. The topics he chooses are fascinating, especially the section about the many ways the universe is out to get us (you did note the title, didn't you?). His final three chapters about religion and science are bound to ruffle a few feathers, but don't avoid this book on their account. * Results may vary.

And certainly the universe is full of things that can kill the fuck out of us. But the universe is incredibly interesting beyond the obvious negatives of cosmic death.Tyson really breaks apart concepts too complicated for me to explain into little chunks, allowing access for non-astrophysicists. I found his approach witty, interesting, and generally fun.This book is a 5 star book without reservation. You finish the book feeling as if you just sat through the physics class you were too terrified to take in college, but, instead of some professor who is out to give you Fs, your grandfather taught it.I would compare this book with Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", which also attacks the ivy-walled tradition in some science, making it accessible to us liberal arts majors."

There's a lot of history of science in it, as well as descriptions of the universe. It's diverse in what it covers, and yet it all is well bound up with science. If you liked Cosmos, give Death by Black Hole a read.Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist and is currently the director of the Hayden Planetarium and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. You may have seen him on any number of television shows, such as History Channel's ""The Universe,"" ""The Colbert Report"" and PBS's ""Nova Science Now,"" the latter of which he hosts.

I've read too many other books on the subject, and while I praise deGrasse Tyson as both a teacher and a storyteller of the cosmos, I did not feel this collection of essays compared to the more robust information you get from the likes of Brian Greene, one of deGrasse Tyson's contemporaries. One of the author's instincts, I believe, is to over-inform on the unnecessary and quip on the most interesting, and in so doing, he loses not only his base...but in fact negates a base readership altogether. Don't discount it based on my opinion...it's good and if you haven't read much on the cosmos, this is a fair-to-decent launching point. That said, I didn't feel this broke any new barriers...perhaps just rehashed a few that I was already acquainted with.

This book is, in essence, a collection of articles which Tyson published in the National History magazine. There is nothing wrong with that concept by itself. At the same time, I do not think he managed to organize his essays into a coherent whole. Chapters or some parts of them are often repetitive, there is no logical story line, the author juggles too many topics – some of them are quite interesting while others are closer to a pop-culture-like depiction of astronomy. Finally, I normally enjoy when an acclaimed scientist seasons up his/her heavy stuff with a great dose of humor- there are plenty of great examples. In the case of this book though I felt that Tyson desperately tried to appear as the funniest astronomer of all times but his efforts often appeared more artificial than genuine."

Each chapter, each essay explores a different avenue either of late scientific discoveries, personalities of famous scientists, or the role of science in popular culture. Even if you know nothing of science what's amazing about this book is the way Tyson makes the most esoteric or obscure ideas and concepts seem like something the layman could have a working understanding of. That, to me, is why the reader should read this book. Science is about human initiative and discovery, and what good is it if the culture that benefits from such science can't even understand it. Tyson makes quarks, astronomy, aliens, and even the ultimate death of the universe approachable and relevant. Wonderful book."

As a result, I had a difficult time maintaining my interest in this book. It took me almost a month to force myself to finish, and that's only because when I got to less than 100 pages I was motivated to finish to just be able to move on.The only reason this book is getting two stars instead of one is because some of the individual essays were interesting on their own."

I felt I wanted a redo because a lot of what Hawking said went over my head. I was hoping deGrasse would be a better and he did deliver. He has the ability to break down complex science jargon for those who do not have a science background to understand. I commend him that ability because it must at times be frustrating.  Death by Black Hole was a really decent read and I did learn quite a bit from. I would recommend this book to others to read.

However, I did end up learning a lot because Dr. Tyson talks about a wide variety of topics. Additionally, he gives a plethora of interesting pieces of information that are perhaps unknown to many people (many depend on his own calculations).Moreover, being a collection of articles he had written did not affect the flow the book; I think the book was superbly edited."
280,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,4,"A collection of essays by one of the best science popularizers of our time. It's not just about black holes; it's about a lot of different science topics, including astronomy, skepticism, and history of science. It's all very informative and accessible, and each essay is short enough that it's not overwhelming. Recommended.A note on the audio: Dion Graham is a fantastic narrator, but I really wish Tyson had read his own book. Ever since watching Cosmos I've wanted him to read me bedtime stories about the marvels of the universe."

The author uses everyday metaphors and analogies to make very complicated things- like black holes- easily understandable. Theories about how life began on earth, the beginning and end of time, and the inevitable demise of planet earth are all covered in this book! The first few chapters are a little slow- but they are building a frame of reference to help those of us that aren't astrophysicists! "
282,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62355864-clarin,5,"I honestly don't know what to say. If you want to have your mind-blown, if you want to expand your knowledge of the universe such that astrophysics and philosophy slowly become the only subjects that you ever take an interest in, this is the book for you. Profound, hilarious, and informative, tidily wrapped into one book. Honestly a life-changer. This book is what cements my decisions on what career to take up. To summarize, read this if you're into cool space stuff."

It has a lot of unique textures that the author included to get the story he was telling about the universe and all that was done to get this far out. Little by little, or a piece by piece. I think people who are into Astronomy should read this because this has a lot of facts that were introduced to me that I would of knew about. I am one of those people who know everything about Astronomy, but I can't tell a lot from all that is happening and what has happened."

289,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30391210-jeremy-borden,5,"Death by Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries, by Neil deGrasse Tyson, is a thrilling journey through the cosmos, from the tiniest of subatomic particles to the largest supermassive black holes. Although this book is primarily a fact-dispensing narrative, a cohesive storyline is not lost. Beginning with a discussion of knowledge itself, Tyson progresses to a description of the cosmos itself, the vast array of phenomena, the universal laws of physics, and how science has come to know and understand these things. He finishes the book with a conversation about the role of science in the modern world and how science interacts with culture and even with religion. Tyson does a great job of making very complex scenarios and processes understandable and easy to grasp. Even when he reaches a topic that could become boring, his humor and wit keep it interesting and entertaining. For example, Tyson explains that the universal laws of physics must remain constant wherever one travels. When Tyson ordered hot cocoa with whipped cream and the waiter asserted the whipped cream had sunk to the bottom, Tyson had an interesting response: “Since whipped cream has a very low density and floats on all liquids that humans consume, I offered the waiter two possible explanations: either somebody forgot to add the whipped cream to my hot cocoa or the universal laws of physics were different in his restaurant” (37). This passage, along with others, show just how engaged the author can keep his readers. Along with his humor, Tyson expresses his awe for the material he discusses. He is clearly humbled by the enormity of the universe and the extraordinary means by which so many pieces of the universe formed: “Yes, not only humans but also every other organism in the cosmos, as well as the planets or moons on which they thrive, would not exist but for the wreckage of spent stars. So you’re made of detritus. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?” (222). Overall, this book warrants little complaint. The author’s humor is wonderful and his excitement for his subject matter is admirable and contagious. The mysteries of the cosmos are explained in a way that makes it difficult not to feel a sense of awe and wonder. Some sections manage to get a little dense, but as long as the reader is interested in the material, these sections remain engaging. Lovers of science in general would enjoy this book. Furthermore, anyone interested in learning about the universe, space, and their phenomena should pick up this book since these topics are presented and explored. Realistically, anyone looking to expand his or her knowledge or looking for a good read could enjoy this book also because it is designed for a curious intellect. However, someone with little to no interest in the universe or cosmology should probably avoid this book as the subject matter could become boring. The section about science and religion is quite intriguing, but it may spark debate with some readers. Tyson provides his own opinions about religion and its relationship with science, expressing a relatively agnostic viewpoint about the divine. Readers with strong religious opinions may find this section to be controversial and as such, they may want to avoid this book or at least skip this section. Still for someone interested in the universe, regardless of religious belief, Tyson’s excellent book will not disappoint. Anyone who wonders about science and discovery should definitely read this tale of the cosmos. Personally, this book, in a way, satisfied my curiosity about the universe, and in a way, only served to spark more curiosity. I learned so much from reading this book, but it inspired me to learn more. My interest in the wonders of the universe was solidified. This was the first of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s books that I have read, but I assure you, he has gained an avid reader. "
290,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7404593-keith-moser,5,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. From his old Daily Show interviews to his recent Cosmos series, he's always seemed like a super cool, super intelligent guy. I bought Death by Black Hole back in early 2013, and it sat on my shelf ever since. I decided to finally pick it up and read it, and it wasn't as daunting as I had feared.Tyson is great at writing for the average man. Nothing in this book made me feel like I needed a PhD to grasp the concept. Everything was interesting.I have two complaints, but obviously nothing enough to drop it from 5 stars. First, I really wish there had been some diagrams. There were plenty of things that I've seen before and some things I haven't that I wish would have been included. I know all about Lagrange points but I would have liked to see them next to his description of them. I have no clue what art piece he's describing that has tree shadows falling in non-parallel lines, and I would have loved to see that. I can't remember any specific examples, but there were at least a dozen times I wanted a diagram.Also, the book is slightly worse because it seems (according to the back cover) that it's a collection of monthly ""Universe"" essays. You can tell that the book was edited because it constantly refers to other sections or adds ""as has been discussed,"" but honestly some of the repetitions were just so frequent it was annoying. Still, the range of topics, the depth of each one, and the overall writing was great. I think perhaps, this book would best be read one chapter every other week or every month to let the knowledge sink in, and keep the repetitions at bay."
291,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1551331-chris-white,5,"Absolutely wonderful, Tyson's boundless passion for science and astronomy come through in every sentence and while I'm rarely bored learning about the cosmos no one brings it to life quite like him.Getting the balance right on a book about science written to be accessible to a wide range of readers is a challenge, presumable even for such experienced educators but I found that it rarely was overly technical to the point that I lost a handle about what he was talking about nor did it feel too shallow to be interesting or consistently teach me new things throughout. One thing that really stood out to me was how often he went into detail about the history of science from speculation of the neolithic people through to what we know now; bringing the process and the practices of science into a broader context and giving us insight into how much we've learned and how much we undoubtably still have yet to discover. I particularly enjoyed his insights into the clashes of worldviews, theologies and politics and what roles they've played in science throughout our history. It underscores the need for an open mind and the importance of rejecting anti-science ideas in a time when it is so often derided and besieged.All of which is not to say that this wasn't a book about our universe first and foremost — it is — from discussions of gravity to the nature of light, the smallest of particles to the possibilities of a multiverse you will find science and reason throughout. And yes, death by black hole, galaxies colliding, extinction events and ultimately the seemingly inevitable fact that one day far from now even our universe will die as the last light goes dark, you'll get plenty of insight into how it could all end for us.Death by Black Hole never failed to leave me in wonderment over our existence and how much we still have yet to learn."
292,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1995871-jake,5,"“The remarkable feature of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them.”That is one of many gems I underlined during my reading of Death by Black Hole. Each of Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson’s articles covers some aspect of the universe and our place within it. I’ve gotten in the habit of keeping a book like this next to my reading chair at all times. Over the last year, I read this collection of essays nice and slow, a chapter here and there. Not all prose needs to be edge of your seat to be worthwhile.Despite the ominous title, this book is not an unrelenting tirade about how the sky is falling, or rather being sucked into singular oblivion. Nor is it an all-out attack on traditional/prevailing beliefs. Death by Black Hole is actually full of wit and humor, irony and candidness. Dr. Tyson has an engaging conversational style, and he never misses a chance to tie science into everyday experience. Plus, I get the sense that his research humbles him as much as he hopes it will humble others.You need not agree with everything Tyson asserts. And you’d do well not to make his the only voice you put currency in. As he says in the chapter titled Life in the Universe, “Ordinarily, there is no riskier step that a scientist (or anyone) can take than to make sweeping generalizations from just one example.”Philosophical implications aside, Death by Black Hole is a great way to get to know the universe you live in better. Anyone who wants to be a good citizen needs to be conversant in science. If for no other reason than scientists--like all policy makers--need to be questioned constantly by the people who fund them. "
293,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8083390-a,4,"A general and very interesting look at how our fascinating universe works. My only frame of reference for this type of work is Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Grand Design"", which attempt to delve fairly deeply into the subject it discusses while still staying outside of the mathematics behind it all. Neil deGrasse Tyson may seem less substantial, but it is largely because he prefers to stick to what has been and what is with regard to the universe. With regard to black holes, whenever we travel into them it is characteristic of deGrasse Tyson's viewpoint that we die. A few brief questions center on what may happen out of the other side, but that is the type of speculation which delves so far outside of the consensus that I don't believe Tyson is very interested in dwelling on it. Don't worry - Tyson ignores the fact that we'd die at any number of points along the journey into the black hole to explore a treasure trove of fascinating details. The scientific consensus provides so many fascinating points to consider about the way our universe works that there is plenty here to enjoy, or refresh on if you've read other pop. science works."
294,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,4,"It took me over two months to read this book, but I think reading this book slowly is the perfect way to enjoy it. When I realized I wasn't going to finish it in time for book club, I slowed down and started reading a chapter a night before going to bed. The chapters are just the right length - 4 to 5 pages - so you aren't overwhelmed with information, and then you have a whole day to mull it over (and the information is very mullable) before you tackle the next topic. I could feel myself getting smarter!*Neil de Grasse Tyson has a real gift for making complicated astrophysics accessible. The topics he chooses are fascinating, especially the section about the many ways the universe is out to get us (you did note the title, didn't you?). His final three chapters about religion and science are bound to ruffle a few feathers, but don't avoid this book on their account. * Results may vary. These statements have not been reviewed by Neil deGrasse Tyson or anyone that is REALLY smart."
295,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1254989-dan,5,"Well, it is a little bit of a downer to think that the world will be annihilated in 5 billion years. And certainly the universe is full of things that can kill the fuck out of us. But the universe is incredibly interesting beyond the obvious negatives of cosmic death.Tyson really breaks apart concepts too complicated for me to explain into little chunks, allowing access for non-astrophysicists. I found his approach witty, interesting, and generally fun.This book is a 5 star book without reservation. You finish the book feeling as if you just sat through the physics class you were too terrified to take in college, but, instead of some professor who is out to give you Fs, your grandfather taught it.I would compare this book with Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", which also attacks the ivy-walled tradition in some science, making it accessible to us liberal arts majors."
296,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2680722-miranda-richards,5,"It's not just about black holes, or even just space! I think the best way to describe this is as a Cosmos-type book. There's a lot of history of science in it, as well as descriptions of the universe. It's diverse in what it covers, and yet it all is well bound up with science. If you liked Cosmos, give Death by Black Hole a read.Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist and is currently the director of the Hayden Planetarium and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. You may have seen him on any number of television shows, such as History Channel's ""The Universe,"" ""The Colbert Report"" and PBS's ""Nova Science Now,"" the latter of which he hosts. He is probably the leading science communicator of the day since Carl Sagan's death. I listened to the Blackstone audiobook version from Audible.com, narrated by Dion Graham, who really managed to capture Dr. Tyson's style."

It's a series of essays on many different astronomical subjects that strike the fancy and border science fiction. Astronomy borders science fiction anyway in many cases, so there's even more ground for such forays than ""normal"".From what death by black hole would be like, as the title implies, to the zero-gravitational bowls of our cosmic neighbourhood, to an essay on light-pollution and another one on hollywood astonomy goofs, to the foundations of science, physics and astronomy themselves and their own problematics, to, to, to, and, and and! These are from the top of my head and I read the book more than 2 years ago.Neil deGrasse Tyson seems to be a talented populariser of his field, like Carl Sagan I believe, and I'd like to read more from him. I even want to read DBBH again first chance! If you like astronomy, or want to like astronomy more than you do now, look no further."
298,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13835306-paul-pickell,4," This is a great down-to-Earth book for the lay astrophysicist. Personally, I felt that Tyson accomplished exactly what he set out to do in this prose: provide an accessible understanding of the cosmos at large. In general, the book is a very easy read. Some parts required a deeper understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum or black hole physics, but Tyson is a very accomplished explainer-of-things otherwise, particularly for his field of expertise: star creation and galaxy evolution. Many topics are repeated thoroughly throughout the some 40 chapters, sometimes nearly word-for-word. Tyson is unabashedly an Americanist in his view of science. I leave a star absent because of his no-holds-barred attitude toward ""ancients"" and non-""civilizations"", providing little recognition of the possibility that other humans could have come to similar conclusions throughout history that needn't lived in the ""Northern"" or ""Western hemispheres"". Tyson's work is colonizing, in this way."
299,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3789573-michael-flanagan,4,"Learning about the space has never been such fun. The author's enthusiasm for all things cosmic comes shining through in this book. As a person that has a passing interest in black holes, quasar and other stuff like that. This book provides a great crash course in all things spacey. I now feel a little bit smarter but I am also now in awe of the scientist t past and present that seek to unravel the secrets of our universe. The book is cut up nicely into sections dealing with individual subjects. I did find it a tad annoying that the authors amusing explanations of certain things repeated throughout the book. This to me tarnished this otherwise great read. I particularly liked how he pulled apart common misconceptions like the sun rises in the east and set in the west. Overall this is science delivered in a way us commoners can understand without dumbing it down too much. As for the title I for one am not in favour of meeting my end this way."

He does spend a bit of time on the requisite bemoaning of popular innumeracy and scientific ignorance (fact: the sun is not yellow, and the time between sunrise and sunset is longer than 12 hours during either spring or autumn equinox), but most of the time he maintains a good sense of humor.Which he should, because modern astronomy has so many mind-bogglingly weird things to tell us that it's not as if he has to be stern or bombastic to have something interesting to say. Really, modern astrophysics has mind-bendingly counterintuitive things to tell us about space, time, the nature of the universe, and our place in it, and I know of no religion (orthodox or fringe) which is able to come close. These are people who speak earnestly and sanely with one another about whether or not there are 11 spatial dimensions, whether or not black holes can destroy information, and how the universe after 1/100th of a second differed from the universe after one millionth of a second. If he did not leaven this with earthly humor, it would seem to surreal to think on for long.“As a child, I knew that at night, with the lights out, infrared vision would discover monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded. Infrared vision would thus miss a bedroom monster completely because it would simply blend in with the walls and door.”This also gives one a hint of what kind of a child deGrasse Tyson was.DeGrasse Tyson is as fun to read as he is to listen to.

319,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30391210-jeremy-borden,5,"Death by Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries, by Neil deGrasse Tyson, is a thrilling journey through the cosmos, from the tiniest of subatomic particles to the largest supermassive black holes. Although this book is primarily a fact-dispensing narrative, a cohesive storyline is not lost. Beginning with a discussion of knowledge itself, Tyson progresses to a description of the cosmos itself, the vast array of phenomena, the universal laws of physics, and how science has come to know and understand these things. He finishes the book with a conversation about the role of science in the modern world and how science interacts with culture and even with religion. Tyson does a great job of making very complex scenarios and processes understandable and easy to grasp. Even when he reaches a topic that could become boring, his humor and wit keep it interesting and entertaining. For example, Tyson explains that the universal laws of physics must remain constant wherever one travels. When Tyson ordered hot cocoa with whipped cream and the waiter asserted the whipped cream had sunk to the bottom, Tyson had an interesting response: “Since whipped cream has a very low density and floats on all liquids that humans consume, I offered the waiter two possible explanations: either somebody forgot to add the whipped cream to my hot cocoa or the universal laws of physics were different in his restaurant” (37). This passage, along with others, show just how engaged the author can keep his readers. Along with his humor, Tyson expresses his awe for the material he discusses. He is clearly humbled by the enormity of the universe and the extraordinary means by which so many pieces of the universe formed: “Yes, not only humans but also every other organism in the cosmos, as well as the planets or moons on which they thrive, would not exist but for the wreckage of spent stars. So you’re made of detritus. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?” (222). Overall, this book warrants little complaint. The author’s humor is wonderful and his excitement for his subject matter is admirable and contagious. The mysteries of the cosmos are explained in a way that makes it difficult not to feel a sense of awe and wonder. Some sections manage to get a little dense, but as long as the reader is interested in the material, these sections remain engaging. Lovers of science in general would enjoy this book. Furthermore, anyone interested in learning about the universe, space, and their phenomena should pick up this book since these topics are presented and explored. Realistically, anyone looking to expand his or her knowledge or looking for a good read could enjoy this book also because it is designed for a curious intellect. However, someone with little to no interest in the universe or cosmology should probably avoid this book as the subject matter could become boring. The section about science and religion is quite intriguing, but it may spark debate with some readers. Tyson provides his own opinions about religion and its relationship with science, expressing a relatively agnostic viewpoint about the divine. Readers with strong religious opinions may find this section to be controversial and as such, they may want to avoid this book or at least skip this section. Still for someone interested in the universe, regardless of religious belief, Tyson’s excellent book will not disappoint. Anyone who wonders about science and discovery should definitely read this tale of the cosmos. Personally, this book, in a way, satisfied my curiosity about the universe, and in a way, only served to spark more curiosity. I learned so much from reading this book, but it inspired me to learn more. My interest in the wonders of the universe was solidified. This was the first of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s books that I have read, but I assure you, he has gained an avid reader. "
320,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7404593-keith-moser,5,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. From his old Daily Show interviews to his recent Cosmos series, he's always seemed like a super cool, super intelligent guy. I bought Death by Black Hole back in early 2013, and it sat on my shelf ever since. I decided to finally pick it up and read it, and it wasn't as daunting as I had feared.Tyson is great at writing for the average man. Nothing in this book made me feel like I needed a PhD to grasp the concept. Everything was interesting.I have two complaints, but obviously nothing enough to drop it from 5 stars. First, I really wish there had been some diagrams. There were plenty of things that I've seen before and some things I haven't that I wish would have been included. I know all about Lagrange points but I would have liked to see them next to his description of them. I have no clue what art piece he's describing that has tree shadows falling in non-parallel lines, and I would have loved to see that. I can't remember any specific examples, but there were at least a dozen times I wanted a diagram.Also, the book is slightly worse because it seems (according to the back cover) that it's a collection of monthly ""Universe"" essays. You can tell that the book was edited because it constantly refers to other sections or adds ""as has been discussed,"" but honestly some of the repetitions were just so frequent it was annoying. Still, the range of topics, the depth of each one, and the overall writing was great. I think perhaps, this book would best be read one chapter every other week or every month to let the knowledge sink in, and keep the repetitions at bay."
321,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1551331-chris-white,5,"Absolutely wonderful, Tyson's boundless passion for science and astronomy come through in every sentence and while I'm rarely bored learning about the cosmos no one brings it to life quite like him.Getting the balance right on a book about science written to be accessible to a wide range of readers is a challenge, presumable even for such experienced educators but I found that it rarely was overly technical to the point that I lost a handle about what he was talking about nor did it feel too shallow to be interesting or consistently teach me new things throughout. One thing that really stood out to me was how often he went into detail about the history of science from speculation of the neolithic people through to what we know now; bringing the process and the practices of science into a broader context and giving us insight into how much we've learned and how much we undoubtably still have yet to discover. I particularly enjoyed his insights into the clashes of worldviews, theologies and politics and what roles they've played in science throughout our history. It underscores the need for an open mind and the importance of rejecting anti-science ideas in a time when it is so often derided and besieged.All of which is not to say that this wasn't a book about our universe first and foremost — it is — from discussions of gravity to the nature of light, the smallest of particles to the possibilities of a multiverse you will find science and reason throughout. And yes, death by black hole, galaxies colliding, extinction events and ultimately the seemingly inevitable fact that one day far from now even our universe will die as the last light goes dark, you'll get plenty of insight into how it could all end for us.Death by Black Hole never failed to leave me in wonderment over our existence and how much we still have yet to learn."
322,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1995871-jake,5,"“The remarkable feature of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them.”That is one of many gems I underlined during my reading of Death by Black Hole. Each of Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson’s articles covers some aspect of the universe and our place within it. I’ve gotten in the habit of keeping a book like this next to my reading chair at all times. Over the last year, I read this collection of essays nice and slow, a chapter here and there. Not all prose needs to be edge of your seat to be worthwhile.Despite the ominous title, this book is not an unrelenting tirade about how the sky is falling, or rather being sucked into singular oblivion. Nor is it an all-out attack on traditional/prevailing beliefs. Death by Black Hole is actually full of wit and humor, irony and candidness. Dr. Tyson has an engaging conversational style, and he never misses a chance to tie science into everyday experience. Plus, I get the sense that his research humbles him as much as he hopes it will humble others.You need not agree with everything Tyson asserts. And you’d do well not to make his the only voice you put currency in. As he says in the chapter titled Life in the Universe, “Ordinarily, there is no riskier step that a scientist (or anyone) can take than to make sweeping generalizations from just one example.”Philosophical implications aside, Death by Black Hole is a great way to get to know the universe you live in better. Anyone who wants to be a good citizen needs to be conversant in science. If for no other reason than scientists--like all policy makers--need to be questioned constantly by the people who fund them. "
323,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8083390-a,4,"A general and very interesting look at how our fascinating universe works. My only frame of reference for this type of work is Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Grand Design"", which attempt to delve fairly deeply into the subject it discusses while still staying outside of the mathematics behind it all. Neil deGrasse Tyson may seem less substantial, but it is largely because he prefers to stick to what has been and what is with regard to the universe. With regard to black holes, whenever we travel into them it is characteristic of deGrasse Tyson's viewpoint that we die. A few brief questions center on what may happen out of the other side, but that is the type of speculation which delves so far outside of the consensus that I don't believe Tyson is very interested in dwelling on it. Don't worry - Tyson ignores the fact that we'd die at any number of points along the journey into the black hole to explore a treasure trove of fascinating details. The scientific consensus provides so many fascinating points to consider about the way our universe works that there is plenty here to enjoy, or refresh on if you've read other pop. science works."
324,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,4,"It took me over two months to read this book, but I think reading this book slowly is the perfect way to enjoy it. When I realized I wasn't going to finish it in time for book club, I slowed down and started reading a chapter a night before going to bed. The chapters are just the right length - 4 to 5 pages - so you aren't overwhelmed with information, and then you have a whole day to mull it over (and the information is very mullable) before you tackle the next topic. I could feel myself getting smarter!*Neil de Grasse Tyson has a real gift for making complicated astrophysics accessible. The topics he chooses are fascinating, especially the section about the many ways the universe is out to get us (you did note the title, didn't you?). His final three chapters about religion and science are bound to ruffle a few feathers, but don't avoid this book on their account. * Results may vary. These statements have not been reviewed by Neil deGrasse Tyson or anyone that is REALLY smart."
325,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1254989-dan,5,"Well, it is a little bit of a downer to think that the world will be annihilated in 5 billion years. And certainly the universe is full of things that can kill the fuck out of us. But the universe is incredibly interesting beyond the obvious negatives of cosmic death.Tyson really breaks apart concepts too complicated for me to explain into little chunks, allowing access for non-astrophysicists. I found his approach witty, interesting, and generally fun.This book is a 5 star book without reservation. You finish the book feeling as if you just sat through the physics class you were too terrified to take in college, but, instead of some professor who is out to give you Fs, your grandfather taught it.I would compare this book with Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", which also attacks the ivy-walled tradition in some science, making it accessible to us liberal arts majors."
326,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2680722-miranda-richards,5,"It's not just about black holes, or even just space! I think the best way to describe this is as a Cosmos-type book. There's a lot of history of science in it, as well as descriptions of the universe. It's diverse in what it covers, and yet it all is well bound up with science. If you liked Cosmos, give Death by Black Hole a read.Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist and is currently the director of the Hayden Planetarium and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. You may have seen him on any number of television shows, such as History Channel's ""The Universe,"" ""The Colbert Report"" and PBS's ""Nova Science Now,"" the latter of which he hosts. He is probably the leading science communicator of the day since Carl Sagan's death. I listened to the Blackstone audiobook version from Audible.com, narrated by Dion Graham, who really managed to capture Dr. Tyson's style."

It's a series of essays on many different astronomical subjects that strike the fancy and border science fiction. Astronomy borders science fiction anyway in many cases, so there's even more ground for such forays than ""normal"".From what death by black hole would be like, as the title implies, to the zero-gravitational bowls of our cosmic neighbourhood, to an essay on light-pollution and another one on hollywood astonomy goofs, to the foundations of science, physics and astronomy themselves and their own problematics, to, to, to, and, and and! These are from the top of my head and I read the book more than 2 years ago.Neil deGrasse Tyson seems to be a talented populariser of his field, like Carl Sagan I believe, and I'd like to read more from him.

328,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13835306-paul-pickell,4," This is a great down-to-Earth book for the lay astrophysicist. Personally, I felt that Tyson accomplished exactly what he set out to do in this prose: provide an accessible understanding of the cosmos at large. In general, the book is a very easy read. Some parts required a deeper understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum or black hole physics, but Tyson is a very accomplished explainer-of-things otherwise, particularly for his field of expertise: star creation and galaxy evolution. Many topics are repeated thoroughly throughout the some 40 chapters, sometimes nearly word-for-word. Tyson is unabashedly an Americanist in his view of science. I leave a star absent because of his no-holds-barred attitude toward ""ancients"" and non-""civilizations"", providing little recognition of the possibility that other humans could have come to similar conclusions throughout history that needn't lived in the ""Northern"" or ""Western hemispheres"". Tyson's work is colonizing, in this way."
329,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3789573-michael-flanagan,4,"Learning about the space has never been such fun. The author's enthusiasm for all things cosmic comes shining through in this book. As a person that has a passing interest in black holes, quasar and other stuff like that. This book provides a great crash course in all things spacey. I now feel a little bit smarter but I am also now in awe of the scientist t past and present that seek to unravel the secrets of our universe. The book is cut up nicely into sections dealing with individual subjects. I did find it a tad annoying that the authors amusing explanations of certain things repeated throughout the book. This to me tarnished this otherwise great read. I particularly liked how he pulled apart common misconceptions like the sun rises in the east and set in the west. Overall this is science delivered in a way us commoners can understand without dumbing it down too much. As for the title I for one am not in favour of meeting my end this way."

He does spend a bit of time on the requisite bemoaning of popular innumeracy and scientific ignorance (fact: the sun is not yellow, and the time between sunrise and sunset is longer than 12 hours during either spring or autumn equinox), but most of the time he maintains a good sense of humor.Which he should, because modern astronomy has so many mind-bogglingly weird things to tell us that it's not as if he has to be stern or bombastic to have something interesting to say. Really, modern astrophysics has mind-bendingly counterintuitive things to tell us about space, time, the nature of the universe, and our place in it, and I know of no religion (orthodox or fringe) which is able to come close. These are people who speak earnestly and sanely with one another about whether or not there are 11 spatial dimensions, whether or not black holes can destroy information, and how the universe after 1/100th of a second differed from the universe after one millionth of a second. If he did not leaven this with earthly humor, it would seem to surreal to think on for long.“As a child, I knew that at night, with the lights out, infrared vision would discover monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded. Infrared vision would thus miss a bedroom monster completely because it would simply blend in with the walls and door.”This also gives one a hint of what kind of a child deGrasse Tyson was.DeGrasse Tyson is as fun to read as he is to listen to. Recommended."
333,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2084139-bryce-holt,3,"Gah, I suffered from the worst malady a reader can have while making my way through the audio version of this - disenchantment. I've read too many other books on the subject, and while I praise deGrasse Tyson as both a teacher and a storyteller of the cosmos, I did not feel this collection of essays compared to the more robust information you get from the likes of Brian Greene, one of deGrasse Tyson's contemporaries. One of the author's instincts, I believe, is to over-inform on the unnecessary and quip on the most interesting, and in so doing, he loses not only his base...but in fact negates a base readership altogether. Don't discount it based on my opinion...it's good and if you haven't read much on the cosmos, this is a fair-to-decent launching point. That said, I didn't feel this broke any new barriers...perhaps just rehashed a few that I was already acquainted with. Anyway, this is one of those few 3-ratings I'd suggest, but ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene or ""The Theory of Everything"" by Hawking would always come recommended before it. "
334,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53373701-shoti,2,"I liked less this book than the other one I have read from Tyson, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution. This book is, in essence, a collection of articles which Tyson published in the National History magazine. There is nothing wrong with that concept by itself. At the same time, I do not think he managed to organize his essays into a coherent whole. Chapters or some parts of them are often repetitive, there is no logical story line, the author juggles too many topics – some of them are quite interesting while others are closer to a pop-culture-like depiction of astronomy. Finally, I normally enjoy when an acclaimed scientist seasons up his/her heavy stuff with a great dose of humor- there are plenty of great examples. In the case of this book though I felt that Tyson desperately tried to appear as the funniest astronomer of all times but his efforts often appeared more artificial than genuine."
335,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a wonderful writer, public speaker, and ceaseless defender of the necessity for science as something relevant in our culture and every essay in this book is a love letter to science. Each chapter, each essay explores a different avenue either of late scientific discoveries, personalities of famous scientists, or the role of science in popular culture. Even if you know nothing of science what's amazing about this book is the way Tyson makes the most esoteric or obscure ideas and concepts seem like something the layman could have a working understanding of. That, to me, is why the reader should read this book. Science is about human initiative and discovery, and what good is it if the culture that benefits from such science can't even understand it. Tyson makes quarks, astronomy, aliens, and even the ultimate death of the universe approachable and relevant. Wonderful book."

I think my main problem is with the structure of the book, which just seemed to be a loose collection of loosely organized essays. The essays are not continuous and switch abruptly from one topic to another. I felt like the author just copied and pasted random past essays to create this book. As a result, I had a difficult time maintaining my interest in this book. It took me almost a month to force myself to finish, and that's only because when I got to less than 100 pages I was motivated to finish to just be able to move on.The only reason this book is getting two stars instead of one is because some of the individual essays were interesting on their own."

349,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30391210-jeremy-borden,5,"Death by Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries, by Neil deGrasse Tyson, is a thrilling journey through the cosmos, from the tiniest of subatomic particles to the largest supermassive black holes. Although this book is primarily a fact-dispensing narrative, a cohesive storyline is not lost. Beginning with a discussion of knowledge itself, Tyson progresses to a description of the cosmos itself, the vast array of phenomena, the universal laws of physics, and how science has come to know and understand these things. He finishes the book with a conversation about the role of science in the modern world and how science interacts with culture and even with religion. Tyson does a great job of making very complex scenarios and processes understandable and easy to grasp. Even when he reaches a topic that could become boring, his humor and wit keep it interesting and entertaining. For example, Tyson explains that the universal laws of physics must remain constant wherever one travels. When Tyson ordered hot cocoa with whipped cream and the waiter asserted the whipped cream had sunk to the bottom, Tyson had an interesting response: “Since whipped cream has a very low density and floats on all liquids that humans consume, I offered the waiter two possible explanations: either somebody forgot to add the whipped cream to my hot cocoa or the universal laws of physics were different in his restaurant” (37). This passage, along with others, show just how engaged the author can keep his readers. Along with his humor, Tyson expresses his awe for the material he discusses. He is clearly humbled by the enormity of the universe and the extraordinary means by which so many pieces of the universe formed: “Yes, not only humans but also every other organism in the cosmos, as well as the planets or moons on which they thrive, would not exist but for the wreckage of spent stars. So you’re made of detritus. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?” (222). Overall, this book warrants little complaint. The author’s humor is wonderful and his excitement for his subject matter is admirable and contagious. The mysteries of the cosmos are explained in a way that makes it difficult not to feel a sense of awe and wonder. Some sections manage to get a little dense, but as long as the reader is interested in the material, these sections remain engaging. Lovers of science in general would enjoy this book. Furthermore, anyone interested in learning about the universe, space, and their phenomena should pick up this book since these topics are presented and explored. Realistically, anyone looking to expand his or her knowledge or looking for a good read could enjoy this book also because it is designed for a curious intellect. However, someone with little to no interest in the universe or cosmology should probably avoid this book as the subject matter could become boring. The section about science and religion is quite intriguing, but it may spark debate with some readers. Tyson provides his own opinions about religion and its relationship with science, expressing a relatively agnostic viewpoint about the divine. Readers with strong religious opinions may find this section to be controversial and as such, they may want to avoid this book or at least skip this section. Still for someone interested in the universe, regardless of religious belief, Tyson’s excellent book will not disappoint. Anyone who wonders about science and discovery should definitely read this tale of the cosmos. Personally, this book, in a way, satisfied my curiosity about the universe, and in a way, only served to spark more curiosity. I learned so much from reading this book, but it inspired me to learn more. My interest in the wonders of the universe was solidified. This was the first of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s books that I have read, but I assure you, he has gained an avid reader. "
350,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7404593-keith-moser,5,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. From his old Daily Show interviews to his recent Cosmos series, he's always seemed like a super cool, super intelligent guy. I bought Death by Black Hole back in early 2013, and it sat on my shelf ever since. I decided to finally pick it up and read it, and it wasn't as daunting as I had feared.Tyson is great at writing for the average man. Nothing in this book made me feel like I needed a PhD to grasp the concept. Everything was interesting.I have two complaints, but obviously nothing enough to drop it from 5 stars. First, I really wish there had been some diagrams. There were plenty of things that I've seen before and some things I haven't that I wish would have been included. I know all about Lagrange points but I would have liked to see them next to his description of them. I have no clue what art piece he's describing that has tree shadows falling in non-parallel lines, and I would have loved to see that. I can't remember any specific examples, but there were at least a dozen times I wanted a diagram.Also, the book is slightly worse because it seems (according to the back cover) that it's a collection of monthly ""Universe"" essays. You can tell that the book was edited because it constantly refers to other sections or adds ""as has been discussed,"" but honestly some of the repetitions were just so frequent it was annoying. Still, the range of topics, the depth of each one, and the overall writing was great. I think perhaps, this book would best be read one chapter every other week or every month to let the knowledge sink in, and keep the repetitions at bay."
351,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1551331-chris-white,5,"Absolutely wonderful, Tyson's boundless passion for science and astronomy come through in every sentence and while I'm rarely bored learning about the cosmos no one brings it to life quite like him.Getting the balance right on a book about science written to be accessible to a wide range of readers is a challenge, presumable even for such experienced educators but I found that it rarely was overly technical to the point that I lost a handle about what he was talking about nor did it feel too shallow to be interesting or consistently teach me new things throughout. One thing that really stood out to me was how often he went into detail about the history of science from speculation of the neolithic people through to what we know now; bringing the process and the practices of science into a broader context and giving us insight into how much we've learned and how much we undoubtably still have yet to discover. I particularly enjoyed his insights into the clashes of worldviews, theologies and politics and what roles they've played in science throughout our history. It underscores the need for an open mind and the importance of rejecting anti-science ideas in a time when it is so often derided and besieged.All of which is not to say that this wasn't a book about our universe first and foremost — it is — from discussions of gravity to the nature of light, the smallest of particles to the possibilities of a multiverse you will find science and reason throughout. And yes, death by black hole, galaxies colliding, extinction events and ultimately the seemingly inevitable fact that one day far from now even our universe will die as the last light goes dark, you'll get plenty of insight into how it could all end for us.Death by Black Hole never failed to leave me in wonderment over our existence and how much we still have yet to learn."
352,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1995871-jake,5,"“The remarkable feature of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them.”That is one of many gems I underlined during my reading of Death by Black Hole. Each of Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson’s articles covers some aspect of the universe and our place within it. I’ve gotten in the habit of keeping a book like this next to my reading chair at all times. Over the last year, I read this collection of essays nice and slow, a chapter here and there. Not all prose needs to be edge of your seat to be worthwhile.Despite the ominous title, this book is not an unrelenting tirade about how the sky is falling, or rather being sucked into singular oblivion. Nor is it an all-out attack on traditional/prevailing beliefs. Death by Black Hole is actually full of wit and humor, irony and candidness. Dr. Tyson has an engaging conversational style, and he never misses a chance to tie science into everyday experience. Plus, I get the sense that his research humbles him as much as he hopes it will humble others.You need not agree with everything Tyson asserts. And you’d do well not to make his the only voice you put currency in. As he says in the chapter titled Life in the Universe, “Ordinarily, there is no riskier step that a scientist (or anyone) can take than to make sweeping generalizations from just one example.”Philosophical implications aside, Death by Black Hole is a great way to get to know the universe you live in better. Anyone who wants to be a good citizen needs to be conversant in science. If for no other reason than scientists--like all policy makers--need to be questioned constantly by the people who fund them. "
353,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8083390-a,4,"A general and very interesting look at how our fascinating universe works. My only frame of reference for this type of work is Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Grand Design"", which attempt to delve fairly deeply into the subject it discusses while still staying outside of the mathematics behind it all. Neil deGrasse Tyson may seem less substantial, but it is largely because he prefers to stick to what has been and what is with regard to the universe. With regard to black holes, whenever we travel into them it is characteristic of deGrasse Tyson's viewpoint that we die. A few brief questions center on what may happen out of the other side, but that is the type of speculation which delves so far outside of the consensus that I don't believe Tyson is very interested in dwelling on it. Don't worry - Tyson ignores the fact that we'd die at any number of points along the journey into the black hole to explore a treasure trove of fascinating details. The scientific consensus provides so many fascinating points to consider about the way our universe works that there is plenty here to enjoy, or refresh on if you've read other pop. science works."
354,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,4,"It took me over two months to read this book, but I think reading this book slowly is the perfect way to enjoy it. When I realized I wasn't going to finish it in time for book club, I slowed down and started reading a chapter a night before going to bed. The chapters are just the right length - 4 to 5 pages - so you aren't overwhelmed with information, and then you have a whole day to mull it over (and the information is very mullable) before you tackle the next topic. I could feel myself getting smarter!*Neil de Grasse Tyson has a real gift for making complicated astrophysics accessible. The topics he chooses are fascinating, especially the section about the many ways the universe is out to get us (you did note the title, didn't you?). His final three chapters about religion and science are bound to ruffle a few feathers, but don't avoid this book on their account. * Results may vary. These statements have not been reviewed by Neil deGrasse Tyson or anyone that is REALLY smart."
355,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1254989-dan,5,"Well, it is a little bit of a downer to think that the world will be annihilated in 5 billion years. And certainly the universe is full of things that can kill the fuck out of us. But the universe is incredibly interesting beyond the obvious negatives of cosmic death.Tyson really breaks apart concepts too complicated for me to explain into little chunks, allowing access for non-astrophysicists. I found his approach witty, interesting, and generally fun.This book is a 5 star book without reservation. You finish the book feeling as if you just sat through the physics class you were too terrified to take in college, but, instead of some professor who is out to give you Fs, your grandfather taught it.I would compare this book with Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", which also attacks the ivy-walled tradition in some science, making it accessible to us liberal arts majors."
356,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2680722-miranda-richards,5,"It's not just about black holes, or even just space! I think the best way to describe this is as a Cosmos-type book. There's a lot of history of science in it, as well as descriptions of the universe. It's diverse in what it covers, and yet it all is well bound up with science. If you liked Cosmos, give Death by Black Hole a read.Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist and is currently the director of the Hayden Planetarium and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. You may have seen him on any number of television shows, such as History Channel's ""The Universe,"" ""The Colbert Report"" and PBS's ""Nova Science Now,"" the latter of which he hosts. He is probably the leading science communicator of the day since Carl Sagan's death. I listened to the Blackstone audiobook version from Audible.com, narrated by Dion Graham, who really managed to capture Dr. Tyson's style."
357,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643358-dimitris-hall,5,"Oh, what a satisfying read this one was... It's a series of essays on many different astronomical subjects that strike the fancy and border science fiction. Astronomy borders science fiction anyway in many cases, so there's even more ground for such forays than ""normal"".From what death by black hole would be like, as the title implies, to the zero-gravitational bowls of our cosmic neighbourhood, to an essay on light-pollution and another one on hollywood astonomy goofs, to the foundations of science, physics and astronomy themselves and their own problematics, to, to, to, and, and and! These are from the top of my head and I read the book more than 2 years ago.Neil deGrasse Tyson seems to be a talented populariser of his field, like Carl Sagan I believe, and I'd like to read more from him. I even want to read DBBH again first chance! If you like astronomy, or want to like astronomy more than you do now, look no further."
358,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13835306-paul-pickell,4," This is a great down-to-Earth book for the lay astrophysicist. Personally, I felt that Tyson accomplished exactly what he set out to do in this prose: provide an accessible understanding of the cosmos at large. In general, the book is a very easy read. Some parts required a deeper understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum or black hole physics, but Tyson is a very accomplished explainer-of-things otherwise, particularly for his field of expertise: star creation and galaxy evolution. Many topics are repeated thoroughly throughout the some 40 chapters, sometimes nearly word-for-word. Tyson is unabashedly an Americanist in his view of science. I leave a star absent because of his no-holds-barred attitude toward ""ancients"" and non-""civilizations"", providing little recognition of the possibility that other humans could have come to similar conclusions throughout history that needn't lived in the ""Northern"" or ""Western hemispheres"". Tyson's work is colonizing, in this way."
359,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3789573-michael-flanagan,4,"Learning about the space has never been such fun. The author's enthusiasm for all things cosmic comes shining through in this book. As a person that has a passing interest in black holes, quasar and other stuff like that. This book provides a great crash course in all things spacey. I now feel a little bit smarter but I am also now in awe of the scientist t past and present that seek to unravel the secrets of our universe. The book is cut up nicely into sections dealing with individual subjects. I did find it a tad annoying that the authors amusing explanations of certain things repeated throughout the book. This to me tarnished this otherwise great read. I particularly liked how he pulled apart common misconceptions like the sun rises in the east and set in the west. Overall this is science delivered in a way us commoners can understand without dumbing it down too much. As for the title I for one am not in favour of meeting my end this way."

He does spend a bit of time on the requisite bemoaning of popular innumeracy and scientific ignorance (fact: the sun is not yellow, and the time between sunrise and sunset is longer than 12 hours during either spring or autumn equinox), but most of the time he maintains a good sense of humor.Which he should, because modern astronomy has so many mind-bogglingly weird things to tell us that it's not as if he has to be stern or bombastic to have something interesting to say. Really, modern astrophysics has mind-bendingly counterintuitive things to tell us about space, time, the nature of the universe, and our place in it, and I know of no religion (orthodox or fringe) which is able to come close. These are people who speak earnestly and sanely with one another about whether or not there are 11 spatial dimensions, whether or not black holes can destroy information, and how the universe after 1/100th of a second differed from the universe after one millionth of a second. If he did not leaven this with earthly humor, it would seem to surreal to think on for long.“As a child, I knew that at night, with the lights out, infrared vision would discover monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded. Infrared vision would thus miss a bedroom monster completely because it would simply blend in with the walls and door.”This also gives one a hint of what kind of a child deGrasse Tyson was.DeGrasse Tyson is as fun to read as he is to listen to. Recommended."
363,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2084139-bryce-holt,3,"Gah, I suffered from the worst malady a reader can have while making my way through the audio version of this - disenchantment. I've read too many other books on the subject, and while I praise deGrasse Tyson as both a teacher and a storyteller of the cosmos, I did not feel this collection of essays compared to the more robust information you get from the likes of Brian Greene, one of deGrasse Tyson's contemporaries. One of the author's instincts, I believe, is to over-inform on the unnecessary and quip on the most interesting, and in so doing, he loses not only his base...but in fact negates a base readership altogether. Don't discount it based on my opinion...it's good and if you haven't read much on the cosmos, this is a fair-to-decent launching point. That said, I didn't feel this broke any new barriers...perhaps just rehashed a few that I was already acquainted with. Anyway, this is one of those few 3-ratings I'd suggest, but ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene or ""The Theory of Everything"" by Hawking would always come recommended before it. "
364,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53373701-shoti,2,"I liked less this book than the other one I have read from Tyson, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution. This book is, in essence, a collection of articles which Tyson published in the National History magazine. There is nothing wrong with that concept by itself. At the same time, I do not think he managed to organize his essays into a coherent whole. Chapters or some parts of them are often repetitive, there is no logical story line, the author juggles too many topics – some of them are quite interesting while others are closer to a pop-culture-like depiction of astronomy. Finally, I normally enjoy when an acclaimed scientist seasons up his/her heavy stuff with a great dose of humor- there are plenty of great examples. In the case of this book though I felt that Tyson desperately tried to appear as the funniest astronomer of all times but his efforts often appeared more artificial than genuine."
365,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a wonderful writer, public speaker, and ceaseless defender of the necessity for science as something relevant in our culture and every essay in this book is a love letter to science. Each chapter, each essay explores a different avenue either of late scientific discoveries, personalities of famous scientists, or the role of science in popular culture. Even if you know nothing of science what's amazing about this book is the way Tyson makes the most esoteric or obscure ideas and concepts seem like something the layman could have a working understanding of. That, to me, is why the reader should read this book. Science is about human initiative and discovery, and what good is it if the culture that benefits from such science can't even understand it. Tyson makes quarks, astronomy, aliens, and even the ultimate death of the universe approachable and relevant. Wonderful book."
366,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82440-mike,2,"I really didn't like this book. I think my main problem is with the structure of the book, which just seemed to be a loose collection of loosely organized essays. The essays are not continuous and switch abruptly from one topic to another. I felt like the author just copied and pasted random past essays to create this book. As a result, I had a difficult time maintaining my interest in this book. It took me almost a month to force myself to finish, and that's only because when I got to less than 100 pages I was motivated to finish to just be able to move on.The only reason this book is getting two stars instead of one is because some of the individual essays were interesting on their own."

I felt I wanted a redo because a lot of what Hawking said went over my head. I was hoping deGrasse would be a better and he did deliver. He has the ability to break down complex science jargon for those who do not have a science background to understand. I commend him that ability because it must at times be frustrating.  Death by Black Hole was a really decent read and I did learn quite a bit from. I would recommend this book to others to read.

However, I did end up learning a lot because Dr. Tyson talks about a wide variety of topics. Additionally, he gives a plethora of interesting pieces of information that are perhaps unknown to many people (many depend on his own calculations).Moreover, being a collection of articles he had written did not affect the flow the book; I think the book was superbly edited."

Tyson does a great job of making very complex scenarios and processes understandable and easy to grasp. Even when he reaches a topic that could become boring, his humor and wit keep it interesting and entertaining. For example, Tyson explains that the universal laws of physics must remain constant wherever one travels. When Tyson ordered hot cocoa with whipped cream and the waiter asserted the whipped cream had sunk to the bottom, Tyson had an interesting response: “Since whipped cream has a very low density and floats on all liquids that humans consume, I offered the waiter two possible explanations: either somebody forgot to add the whipped cream to my hot cocoa or the universal laws of physics were different in his restaurant” (37). This passage, along with others, show just how engaged the author can keep his readers. Along with his humor, Tyson expresses his awe for the material he discusses. He is clearly humbled by the enormity of the universe and the extraordinary means by which so many pieces of the universe formed: “Yes, not only humans but also every other organism in the cosmos, as well as the planets or moons on which they thrive, would not exist but for the wreckage of spent stars.

Realistically, anyone looking to expand his or her knowledge or looking for a good read could enjoy this book also because it is designed for a curious intellect. However, someone with little to no interest in the universe or cosmology should probably avoid this book as the subject matter could become boring. The section about science and religion is quite intriguing, but it may spark debate with some readers. Tyson provides his own opinions about religion and its relationship with science, expressing a relatively agnostic viewpoint about the divine. Readers with strong religious opinions may find this section to be controversial and as such, they may want to avoid this book or at least skip this section. Still for someone interested in the universe, regardless of religious belief, Tyson’s excellent book will not disappoint. Anyone who wonders about science and discovery should definitely read this tale of the cosmos. Personally, this book, in a way, satisfied my curiosity about the universe, and in a way, only served to spark more curiosity. I learned so much from reading this book, but it inspired me to learn more. My interest in the wonders of the universe was solidified. This was the first of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s books that I have read, but I assure you, he has gained an avid reader. "
380,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7404593-keith-moser,5,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. From his old Daily Show interviews to his recent Cosmos series, he's always seemed like a super cool, super intelligent guy. I bought Death by Black Hole back in early 2013, and it sat on my shelf ever since. I decided to finally pick it up and read it, and it wasn't as daunting as I had feared.Tyson is great at writing for the average man. Nothing in this book made me feel like I needed a PhD to grasp the concept. Everything was interesting.I have two complaints, but obviously nothing enough to drop it from 5 stars. First, I really wish there had been some diagrams. There were plenty of things that I've seen before and some things I haven't that I wish would have been included. I know all about Lagrange points but I would have liked to see them next to his description of them. I have no clue what art piece he's describing that has tree shadows falling in non-parallel lines, and I would have loved to see that. I can't remember any specific examples, but there were at least a dozen times I wanted a diagram.Also, the book is slightly worse because it seems (according to the back cover) that it's a collection of monthly ""Universe"" essays. You can tell that the book was edited because it constantly refers to other sections or adds ""as has been discussed,"" but honestly some of the repetitions were just so frequent it was annoying. Still, the range of topics, the depth of each one, and the overall writing was great. I think perhaps, this book would best be read one chapter every other week or every month to let the knowledge sink in, and keep the repetitions at bay."
381,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1551331-chris-white,5,"Absolutely wonderful, Tyson's boundless passion for science and astronomy come through in every sentence and while I'm rarely bored learning about the cosmos no one brings it to life quite like him.Getting the balance right on a book about science written to be accessible to a wide range of readers is a challenge, presumable even for such experienced educators but I found that it rarely was overly technical to the point that I lost a handle about what he was talking about nor did it feel too shallow to be interesting or consistently teach me new things throughout. One thing that really stood out to me was how often he went into detail about the history of science from speculation of the neolithic people through to what we know now; bringing the process and the practices of science into a broader context and giving us insight into how much we've learned and how much we undoubtably still have yet to discover. I particularly enjoyed his insights into the clashes of worldviews, theologies and politics and what roles they've played in science throughout our history. It underscores the need for an open mind and the importance of rejecting anti-science ideas in a time when it is so often derided and besieged.All of which is not to say that this wasn't a book about our universe first and foremost — it is — from discussions of gravity to the nature of light, the smallest of particles to the possibilities of a multiverse you will find science and reason throughout. And yes, death by black hole, galaxies colliding, extinction events and ultimately the seemingly inevitable fact that one day far from now even our universe will die as the last light goes dark, you'll get plenty of insight into how it could all end for us.Death by Black Hole never failed to leave me in wonderment over our existence and how much we still have yet to learn."
382,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1995871-jake,5,"“The remarkable feature of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them.”That is one of many gems I underlined during my reading of Death by Black Hole. Each of Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson’s articles covers some aspect of the universe and our place within it. I’ve gotten in the habit of keeping a book like this next to my reading chair at all times. Over the last year, I read this collection of essays nice and slow, a chapter here and there. Not all prose needs to be edge of your seat to be worthwhile.Despite the ominous title, this book is not an unrelenting tirade about how the sky is falling, or rather being sucked into singular oblivion. Nor is it an all-out attack on traditional/prevailing beliefs. Death by Black Hole is actually full of wit and humor, irony and candidness. Dr. Tyson has an engaging conversational style, and he never misses a chance to tie science into everyday experience. Plus, I get the sense that his research humbles him as much as he hopes it will humble others.You need not agree with everything Tyson asserts. And you’d do well not to make his the only voice you put currency in. As he says in the chapter titled Life in the Universe, “Ordinarily, there is no riskier step that a scientist (or anyone) can take than to make sweeping generalizations from just one example.”Philosophical implications aside, Death by Black Hole is a great way to get to know the universe you live in better. Anyone who wants to be a good citizen needs to be conversant in science. If for no other reason than scientists--like all policy makers--need to be questioned constantly by the people who fund them. "
383,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8083390-a,4,"A general and very interesting look at how our fascinating universe works. My only frame of reference for this type of work is Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Grand Design"", which attempt to delve fairly deeply into the subject it discusses while still staying outside of the mathematics behind it all. Neil deGrasse Tyson may seem less substantial, but it is largely because he prefers to stick to what has been and what is with regard to the universe. With regard to black holes, whenever we travel into them it is characteristic of deGrasse Tyson's viewpoint that we die. A few brief questions center on what may happen out of the other side, but that is the type of speculation which delves so far outside of the consensus that I don't believe Tyson is very interested in dwelling on it. Don't worry - Tyson ignores the fact that we'd die at any number of points along the journey into the black hole to explore a treasure trove of fascinating details. The scientific consensus provides so many fascinating points to consider about the way our universe works that there is plenty here to enjoy, or refresh on if you've read other pop. science works."
384,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,4,"It took me over two months to read this book, but I think reading this book slowly is the perfect way to enjoy it. When I realized I wasn't going to finish it in time for book club, I slowed down and started reading a chapter a night before going to bed. The chapters are just the right length - 4 to 5 pages - so you aren't overwhelmed with information, and then you have a whole day to mull it over (and the information is very mullable) before you tackle the next topic. I could feel myself getting smarter!*Neil de Grasse Tyson has a real gift for making complicated astrophysics accessible. The topics he chooses are fascinating, especially the section about the many ways the universe is out to get us (you did note the title, didn't you?). His final three chapters about religion and science are bound to ruffle a few feathers, but don't avoid this book on their account. * Results may vary. These statements have not been reviewed by Neil deGrasse Tyson or anyone that is REALLY smart."

And certainly the universe is full of things that can kill the fuck out of us. But the universe is incredibly interesting beyond the obvious negatives of cosmic death.Tyson really breaks apart concepts too complicated for me to explain into little chunks, allowing access for non-astrophysicists. I found his approach witty, interesting, and generally fun.This book is a 5 star book without reservation. You finish the book feeling as if you just sat through the physics class you were too terrified to take in college, but, instead of some professor who is out to give you Fs, your grandfather taught it.I would compare this book with Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", which also attacks the ivy-walled tradition in some science, making it accessible to us liberal arts majors."
386,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2680722-miranda-richards,5,"It's not just about black holes, or even just space! I think the best way to describe this is as a Cosmos-type book. There's a lot of history of science in it, as well as descriptions of the universe. It's diverse in what it covers, and yet it all is well bound up with science. If you liked Cosmos, give Death by Black Hole a read.Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist and is currently the director of the Hayden Planetarium and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. You may have seen him on any number of television shows, such as History Channel's ""The Universe,"" ""The Colbert Report"" and PBS's ""Nova Science Now,"" the latter of which he hosts. He is probably the leading science communicator of the day since Carl Sagan's death. I listened to the Blackstone audiobook version from Audible.com, narrated by Dion Graham, who really managed to capture Dr. Tyson's style."

It's a series of essays on many different astronomical subjects that strike the fancy and border science fiction. Astronomy borders science fiction anyway in many cases, so there's even more ground for such forays than ""normal"".From what death by black hole would be like, as the title implies, to the zero-gravitational bowls of our cosmic neighbourhood, to an essay on light-pollution and another one on hollywood astonomy goofs, to the foundations of science, physics and astronomy themselves and their own problematics, to, to, to, and, and and! These are from the top of my head and I read the book more than 2 years ago.Neil deGrasse Tyson seems to be a talented populariser of his field, like Carl Sagan I believe, and I'd like to read more from him. I even want to read DBBH again first chance! If you like astronomy, or want to like astronomy more than you do now, look no further."

Personally, I felt that Tyson accomplished exactly what he set out to do in this prose: provide an accessible understanding of the cosmos at large. In general, the book is a very easy read. Some parts required a deeper understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum or black hole physics, but Tyson is a very accomplished explainer-of-things otherwise, particularly for his field of expertise: star creation and galaxy evolution. Many topics are repeated thoroughly throughout the some 40 chapters, sometimes nearly word-for-word. Tyson is unabashedly an Americanist in his view of science. I leave a star absent because of his no-holds-barred attitude toward ""ancients"" and non-""civilizations"", providing little recognition of the possibility that other humans could have come to similar conclusions throughout history that needn't lived in the ""Northern"" or ""Western hemispheres"". Tyson's work is colonizing, in this way."

The author's enthusiasm for all things cosmic comes shining through in this book. As a person that has a passing interest in black holes, quasar and other stuff like that. This book provides a great crash course in all things spacey. I now feel a little bit smarter but I am also now in awe of the scientist t past and present that seek to unravel the secrets of our universe. The book is cut up nicely into sections dealing with individual subjects. I did find it a tad annoying that the authors amusing explanations of certain things repeated throughout the book. This to me tarnished this otherwise great read. I particularly liked how he pulled apart common misconceptions like the sun rises in the east and set in the west. Overall this is science delivered in a way us commoners can understand without dumbing it down too much. As for the title I for one am not in favour of meeting my end this way."

He does spend a bit of time on the requisite bemoaning of popular innumeracy and scientific ignorance (fact: the sun is not yellow, and the time between sunrise and sunset is longer than 12 hours during either spring or autumn equinox), but most of the time he maintains a good sense of humor.Which he should, because modern astronomy has so many mind-bogglingly weird things to tell us that it's not as if he has to be stern or bombastic to have something interesting to say. Really, modern astrophysics has mind-bendingly counterintuitive things to tell us about space, time, the nature of the universe, and our place in it, and I know of no religion (orthodox or fringe) which is able to come close. These are people who speak earnestly and sanely with one another about whether or not there are 11 spatial dimensions, whether or not black holes can destroy information, and how the universe after 1/100th of a second differed from the universe after one millionth of a second. If he did not leaven this with earthly humor, it would seem to surreal to think on for long.“As a child, I knew that at night, with the lights out, infrared vision would discover monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded. Infrared vision would thus miss a bedroom monster completely because it would simply blend in with the walls and door.”This also gives one a hint of what kind of a child deGrasse Tyson was.DeGrasse Tyson is as fun to read as he is to listen to. Recommended."
393,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2084139-bryce-holt,3,"Gah, I suffered from the worst malady a reader can have while making my way through the audio version of this - disenchantment. I've read too many other books on the subject, and while I praise deGrasse Tyson as both a teacher and a storyteller of the cosmos, I did not feel this collection of essays compared to the more robust information you get from the likes of Brian Greene, one of deGrasse Tyson's contemporaries. One of the author's instincts, I believe, is to over-inform on the unnecessary and quip on the most interesting, and in so doing, he loses not only his base...but in fact negates a base readership altogether. Don't discount it based on my opinion...it's good and if you haven't read much on the cosmos, this is a fair-to-decent launching point. That said, I didn't feel this broke any new barriers...perhaps just rehashed a few that I was already acquainted with. Anyway, this is one of those few 3-ratings I'd suggest, but ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene or ""The Theory of Everything"" by Hawking would always come recommended before it. "
394,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53373701-shoti,2,"I liked less this book than the other one I have read from Tyson, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution. This book is, in essence, a collection of articles which Tyson published in the National History magazine. There is nothing wrong with that concept by itself. At the same time, I do not think he managed to organize his essays into a coherent whole. Chapters or some parts of them are often repetitive, there is no logical story line, the author juggles too many topics – some of them are quite interesting while others are closer to a pop-culture-like depiction of astronomy. Finally, I normally enjoy when an acclaimed scientist seasons up his/her heavy stuff with a great dose of humor- there are plenty of great examples. In the case of this book though I felt that Tyson desperately tried to appear as the funniest astronomer of all times but his efforts often appeared more artificial than genuine."
395,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a wonderful writer, public speaker, and ceaseless defender of the necessity for science as something relevant in our culture and every essay in this book is a love letter to science. Each chapter, each essay explores a different avenue either of late scientific discoveries, personalities of famous scientists, or the role of science in popular culture. Even if you know nothing of science what's amazing about this book is the way Tyson makes the most esoteric or obscure ideas and concepts seem like something the layman could have a working understanding of. That, to me, is why the reader should read this book. Science is about human initiative and discovery, and what good is it if the culture that benefits from such science can't even understand it. Tyson makes quarks, astronomy, aliens, and even the ultimate death of the universe approachable and relevant. Wonderful book."
396,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82440-mike,2,"I really didn't like this book. I think my main problem is with the structure of the book, which just seemed to be a loose collection of loosely organized essays. The essays are not continuous and switch abruptly from one topic to another. I felt like the author just copied and pasted random past essays to create this book. As a result, I had a difficult time maintaining my interest in this book. It took me almost a month to force myself to finish, and that's only because when I got to less than 100 pages I was motivated to finish to just be able to move on.The only reason this book is getting two stars instead of one is because some of the individual essays were interesting on their own."

I felt I wanted a redo because a lot of what Hawking said went over my head. I was hoping deGrasse would be a better and he did deliver. He has the ability to break down complex science jargon for those who do not have a science background to understand. I commend him that ability because it must at times be frustrating.  Death by Black Hole was a really decent read and I did learn quite a bit from. I would recommend this book to others to read.

However, I did end up learning a lot because Dr. Tyson talks about a wide variety of topics. Additionally, he gives a plethora of interesting pieces of information that are perhaps unknown to many people (many depend on his own calculations).Moreover, being a collection of articles he had written did not affect the flow the book; I think the book was superbly edited."

409,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30391210-jeremy-borden,5,"Death by Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries, by Neil deGrasse Tyson, is a thrilling journey through the cosmos, from the tiniest of subatomic particles to the largest supermassive black holes. Although this book is primarily a fact-dispensing narrative, a cohesive storyline is not lost. Beginning with a discussion of knowledge itself, Tyson progresses to a description of the cosmos itself, the vast array of phenomena, the universal laws of physics, and how science has come to know and understand these things. He finishes the book with a conversation about the role of science in the modern world and how science interacts with culture and even with religion. Tyson does a great job of making very complex scenarios and processes understandable and easy to grasp. Even when he reaches a topic that could become boring, his humor and wit keep it interesting and entertaining. For example, Tyson explains that the universal laws of physics must remain constant wherever one travels. When Tyson ordered hot cocoa with whipped cream and the waiter asserted the whipped cream had sunk to the bottom, Tyson had an interesting response: “Since whipped cream has a very low density and floats on all liquids that humans consume, I offered the waiter two possible explanations: either somebody forgot to add the whipped cream to my hot cocoa or the universal laws of physics were different in his restaurant” (37). This passage, along with others, show just how engaged the author can keep his readers. Along with his humor, Tyson expresses his awe for the material he discusses. He is clearly humbled by the enormity of the universe and the extraordinary means by which so many pieces of the universe formed: “Yes, not only humans but also every other organism in the cosmos, as well as the planets or moons on which they thrive, would not exist but for the wreckage of spent stars. So you’re made of detritus. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?” (222). Overall, this book warrants little complaint. The author’s humor is wonderful and his excitement for his subject matter is admirable and contagious. The mysteries of the cosmos are explained in a way that makes it difficult not to feel a sense of awe and wonder. Some sections manage to get a little dense, but as long as the reader is interested in the material, these sections remain engaging. Lovers of science in general would enjoy this book. Furthermore, anyone interested in learning about the universe, space, and their phenomena should pick up this book since these topics are presented and explored. Realistically, anyone looking to expand his or her knowledge or looking for a good read could enjoy this book also because it is designed for a curious intellect. However, someone with little to no interest in the universe or cosmology should probably avoid this book as the subject matter could become boring. The section about science and religion is quite intriguing, but it may spark debate with some readers. Tyson provides his own opinions about religion and its relationship with science, expressing a relatively agnostic viewpoint about the divine. Readers with strong religious opinions may find this section to be controversial and as such, they may want to avoid this book or at least skip this section. Still for someone interested in the universe, regardless of religious belief, Tyson’s excellent book will not disappoint. Anyone who wonders about science and discovery should definitely read this tale of the cosmos. Personally, this book, in a way, satisfied my curiosity about the universe, and in a way, only served to spark more curiosity. I learned so much from reading this book, but it inspired me to learn more. My interest in the wonders of the universe was solidified. This was the first of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s books that I have read, but I assure you, he has gained an avid reader. "

Each of Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson’s articles covers some aspect of the universe and our place within it. I’ve gotten in the habit of keeping a book like this next to my reading chair at all times. Over the last year, I read this collection of essays nice and slow, a chapter here and there. Not all prose needs to be edge of your seat to be worthwhile.Despite the ominous title, this book is not an unrelenting tirade about how the sky is falling, or rather being sucked into singular oblivion. Nor is it an all-out attack on traditional/prevailing beliefs. Death by Black Hole is actually full of wit and humor, irony and candidness. Dr. Tyson has an engaging conversational style, and he never misses a chance to tie science into everyday experience. Plus, I get the sense that his research humbles him as much as he hopes it will humble others.You need not agree with everything Tyson asserts. And you’d do well not to make his the only voice you put currency in. As he says in the chapter titled Life in the Universe, “Ordinarily, there is no riskier step that a scientist (or anyone) can take than to make sweeping generalizations from just one example.”Philosophical implications aside, Death by Black Hole is a great way to get to know the universe you live in better. Anyone who wants to be a good citizen needs to be conversant in science. If for no other reason than scientists--like all policy makers--need to be questioned constantly by the people who fund them.

My only frame of reference for this type of work is Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Grand Design"", which attempt to delve fairly deeply into the subject it discusses while still staying outside of the mathematics behind it all. Neil deGrasse Tyson may seem less substantial, but it is largely because he prefers to stick to what has been and what is with regard to the universe. With regard to black holes, whenever we travel into them it is characteristic of deGrasse Tyson's viewpoint that we die. A few brief questions center on what may happen out of the other side, but that is the type of speculation which delves so far outside of the consensus that I don't believe Tyson is very interested in dwelling on it. Don't worry - Tyson ignores the fact that we'd die at any number of points along the journey into the black hole to explore a treasure trove of fascinating details. The scientific consensus provides so many fascinating points to consider about the way our universe works that there is plenty here to enjoy, or refresh on if you've read other pop. science works."

When I realized I wasn't going to finish it in time for book club, I slowed down and started reading a chapter a night before going to bed. The chapters are just the right length - 4 to 5 pages - so you aren't overwhelmed with information, and then you have a whole day to mull it over (and the information is very mullable) before you tackle the next topic. I could feel myself getting smarter!*Neil de Grasse Tyson has a real gift for making complicated astrophysics accessible. The topics he chooses are fascinating, especially the section about the many ways the universe is out to get us (you did note the title, didn't you?). His final three chapters about religion and science are bound to ruffle a few feathers, but don't avoid this book on their account. * Results may vary.

And certainly the universe is full of things that can kill the fuck out of us. But the universe is incredibly interesting beyond the obvious negatives of cosmic death.Tyson really breaks apart concepts too complicated for me to explain into little chunks, allowing access for non-astrophysicists. I found his approach witty, interesting, and generally fun.This book is a 5 star book without reservation. You finish the book feeling as if you just sat through the physics class you were too terrified to take in college, but, instead of some professor who is out to give you Fs, your grandfather taught it.I would compare this book with Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", which also attacks the ivy-walled tradition in some science, making it accessible to us liberal arts majors."

There's a lot of history of science in it, as well as descriptions of the universe. It's diverse in what it covers, and yet it all is well bound up with science. If you liked Cosmos, give Death by Black Hole a read.Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist and is currently the director of the Hayden Planetarium and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. You may have seen him on any number of television shows, such as History Channel's ""The Universe,"" ""The Colbert Report"" and PBS's ""Nova Science Now,"" the latter of which he hosts. He is probably the leading science communicator of the day since Carl Sagan's death.

It's a series of essays on many different astronomical subjects that strike the fancy and border science fiction. Astronomy borders science fiction anyway in many cases, so there's even more ground for such forays than ""normal"".From what death by black hole would be like, as the title implies, to the zero-gravitational bowls of our cosmic neighbourhood, to an essay on light-pollution and another one on hollywood astonomy goofs, to the foundations of science, physics and astronomy themselves and their own problematics, to, to, to, and, and and! These are from the top of my head and I read the book more than 2 years ago.Neil deGrasse Tyson seems to be a talented populariser of his field, like Carl Sagan I believe, and I'd like to read more from him.

Personally, I felt that Tyson accomplished exactly what he set out to do in this prose: provide an accessible understanding of the cosmos at large. In general, the book is a very easy read. Some parts required a deeper understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum or black hole physics, but Tyson is a very accomplished explainer-of-things otherwise, particularly for his field of expertise: star creation and galaxy evolution. Many topics are repeated thoroughly throughout the some 40 chapters, sometimes nearly word-for-word. Tyson is unabashedly an Americanist in his view of science. I leave a star absent because of his no-holds-barred attitude toward ""ancients"" and non-""civilizations"", providing little recognition of the possibility that other humans could have come to similar conclusions throughout history that needn't lived in the ""Northern"" or ""Western hemispheres"". Tyson's work is colonizing, in this way."

The author's enthusiasm for all things cosmic comes shining through in this book. As a person that has a passing interest in black holes, quasar and other stuff like that. This book provides a great crash course in all things spacey. I now feel a little bit smarter but I am also now in awe of the scientist t past and present that seek to unravel the secrets of our universe. The book is cut up nicely into sections dealing with individual subjects. I did find it a tad annoying that the authors amusing explanations of certain things repeated throughout the book. This to me tarnished this otherwise great read. I particularly liked how he pulled apart common misconceptions like the sun rises in the east and set in the west. Overall this is science delivered in a way us commoners can understand without dumbing it down too much. As for the title I for one am not in favour of meeting my end this way."

He does spend a bit of time on the requisite bemoaning of popular innumeracy and scientific ignorance (fact: the sun is not yellow, and the time between sunrise and sunset is longer than 12 hours during either spring or autumn equinox), but most of the time he maintains a good sense of humor.Which he should, because modern astronomy has so many mind-bogglingly weird things to tell us that it's not as if he has to be stern or bombastic to have something interesting to say. Really, modern astrophysics has mind-bendingly counterintuitive things to tell us about space, time, the nature of the universe, and our place in it, and I know of no religion (orthodox or fringe) which is able to come close. These are people who speak earnestly and sanely with one another about whether or not there are 11 spatial dimensions, whether or not black holes can destroy information, and how the universe after 1/100th of a second differed from the universe after one millionth of a second. If he did not leaven this with earthly humor, it would seem to surreal to think on for long.“As a child, I knew that at night, with the lights out, infrared vision would discover monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded. Infrared vision would thus miss a bedroom monster completely because it would simply blend in with the walls and door.”This also gives one a hint of what kind of a child deGrasse Tyson was.DeGrasse Tyson is as fun to read as he is to listen to. Recommended."
423,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2084139-bryce-holt,3,"Gah, I suffered from the worst malady a reader can have while making my way through the audio version of this - disenchantment. I've read too many other books on the subject, and while I praise deGrasse Tyson as both a teacher and a storyteller of the cosmos, I did not feel this collection of essays compared to the more robust information you get from the likes of Brian Greene, one of deGrasse Tyson's contemporaries. One of the author's instincts, I believe, is to over-inform on the unnecessary and quip on the most interesting, and in so doing, he loses not only his base...but in fact negates a base readership altogether. Don't discount it based on my opinion...it's good and if you haven't read much on the cosmos, this is a fair-to-decent launching point. That said, I didn't feel this broke any new barriers...perhaps just rehashed a few that I was already acquainted with. Anyway, this is one of those few 3-ratings I'd suggest, but ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene or ""The Theory of Everything"" by Hawking would always come recommended before it. "
424,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53373701-shoti,2,"I liked less this book than the other one I have read from Tyson, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution. This book is, in essence, a collection of articles which Tyson published in the National History magazine. There is nothing wrong with that concept by itself. At the same time, I do not think he managed to organize his essays into a coherent whole. Chapters or some parts of them are often repetitive, there is no logical story line, the author juggles too many topics – some of them are quite interesting while others are closer to a pop-culture-like depiction of astronomy. Finally, I normally enjoy when an acclaimed scientist seasons up his/her heavy stuff with a great dose of humor- there are plenty of great examples. In the case of this book though I felt that Tyson desperately tried to appear as the funniest astronomer of all times but his efforts often appeared more artificial than genuine."
425,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a wonderful writer, public speaker, and ceaseless defender of the necessity for science as something relevant in our culture and every essay in this book is a love letter to science. Each chapter, each essay explores a different avenue either of late scientific discoveries, personalities of famous scientists, or the role of science in popular culture. Even if you know nothing of science what's amazing about this book is the way Tyson makes the most esoteric or obscure ideas and concepts seem like something the layman could have a working understanding of. That, to me, is why the reader should read this book. Science is about human initiative and discovery, and what good is it if the culture that benefits from such science can't even understand it. Tyson makes quarks, astronomy, aliens, and even the ultimate death of the universe approachable and relevant. Wonderful book."
426,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82440-mike,2,"I really didn't like this book. I think my main problem is with the structure of the book, which just seemed to be a loose collection of loosely organized essays. The essays are not continuous and switch abruptly from one topic to another. I felt like the author just copied and pasted random past essays to create this book. As a result, I had a difficult time maintaining my interest in this book. It took me almost a month to force myself to finish, and that's only because when I got to less than 100 pages I was motivated to finish to just be able to move on.The only reason this book is getting two stars instead of one is because some of the individual essays were interesting on their own."

I felt I wanted a redo because a lot of what Hawking said went over my head. I was hoping deGrasse would be a better and he did deliver. He has the ability to break down complex science jargon for those who do not have a science background to understand. I commend him that ability because it must at times be frustrating.  Death by Black Hole was a really decent read and I did learn quite a bit from. I would recommend this book to others to read.

However, I did end up learning a lot because Dr. Tyson talks about a wide variety of topics. Additionally, he gives a plethora of interesting pieces of information that are perhaps unknown to many people (many depend on his own calculations).Moreover, being a collection of articles he had written did not affect the flow the book; I think the book was superbly edited."

It's all very informative and accessible, and each essay is short enough that it's not overwhelming.

439,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30391210-jeremy-borden,5,"Death by Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries, by Neil deGrasse Tyson, is a thrilling journey through the cosmos, from the tiniest of subatomic particles to the largest supermassive black holes. Although this book is primarily a fact-dispensing narrative, a cohesive storyline is not lost. Beginning with a discussion of knowledge itself, Tyson progresses to a description of the cosmos itself, the vast array of phenomena, the universal laws of physics, and how science has come to know and understand these things. He finishes the book with a conversation about the role of science in the modern world and how science interacts with culture and even with religion. Tyson does a great job of making very complex scenarios and processes understandable and easy to grasp. Even when he reaches a topic that could become boring, his humor and wit keep it interesting and entertaining. For example, Tyson explains that the universal laws of physics must remain constant wherever one travels. When Tyson ordered hot cocoa with whipped cream and the waiter asserted the whipped cream had sunk to the bottom, Tyson had an interesting response: “Since whipped cream has a very low density and floats on all liquids that humans consume, I offered the waiter two possible explanations: either somebody forgot to add the whipped cream to my hot cocoa or the universal laws of physics were different in his restaurant” (37). This passage, along with others, show just how engaged the author can keep his readers. Along with his humor, Tyson expresses his awe for the material he discusses. He is clearly humbled by the enormity of the universe and the extraordinary means by which so many pieces of the universe formed: “Yes, not only humans but also every other organism in the cosmos, as well as the planets or moons on which they thrive, would not exist but for the wreckage of spent stars. So you’re made of detritus. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?” (222). Overall, this book warrants little complaint. The author’s humor is wonderful and his excitement for his subject matter is admirable and contagious. The mysteries of the cosmos are explained in a way that makes it difficult not to feel a sense of awe and wonder. Some sections manage to get a little dense, but as long as the reader is interested in the material, these sections remain engaging. Lovers of science in general would enjoy this book. Furthermore, anyone interested in learning about the universe, space, and their phenomena should pick up this book since these topics are presented and explored. Realistically, anyone looking to expand his or her knowledge or looking for a good read could enjoy this book also because it is designed for a curious intellect. However, someone with little to no interest in the universe or cosmology should probably avoid this book as the subject matter could become boring. The section about science and religion is quite intriguing, but it may spark debate with some readers. Tyson provides his own opinions about religion and its relationship with science, expressing a relatively agnostic viewpoint about the divine. Readers with strong religious opinions may find this section to be controversial and as such, they may want to avoid this book or at least skip this section. Still for someone interested in the universe, regardless of religious belief, Tyson’s excellent book will not disappoint. Anyone who wonders about science and discovery should definitely read this tale of the cosmos. Personally, this book, in a way, satisfied my curiosity about the universe, and in a way, only served to spark more curiosity. I learned so much from reading this book, but it inspired me to learn more. My interest in the wonders of the universe was solidified. This was the first of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s books that I have read, but I assure you, he has gained an avid reader. "
440,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7404593-keith-moser,5,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. From his old Daily Show interviews to his recent Cosmos series, he's always seemed like a super cool, super intelligent guy. I bought Death by Black Hole back in early 2013, and it sat on my shelf ever since. I decided to finally pick it up and read it, and it wasn't as daunting as I had feared.Tyson is great at writing for the average man. Nothing in this book made me feel like I needed a PhD to grasp the concept. Everything was interesting.I have two complaints, but obviously nothing enough to drop it from 5 stars. First, I really wish there had been some diagrams. There were plenty of things that I've seen before and some things I haven't that I wish would have been included. I know all about Lagrange points but I would have liked to see them next to his description of them. I have no clue what art piece he's describing that has tree shadows falling in non-parallel lines, and I would have loved to see that. I can't remember any specific examples, but there were at least a dozen times I wanted a diagram.Also, the book is slightly worse because it seems (according to the back cover) that it's a collection of monthly ""Universe"" essays. You can tell that the book was edited because it constantly refers to other sections or adds ""as has been discussed,"" but honestly some of the repetitions were just so frequent it was annoying. Still, the range of topics, the depth of each one, and the overall writing was great. I think perhaps, this book would best be read one chapter every other week or every month to let the knowledge sink in, and keep the repetitions at bay."
441,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1551331-chris-white,5,"Absolutely wonderful, Tyson's boundless passion for science and astronomy come through in every sentence and while I'm rarely bored learning about the cosmos no one brings it to life quite like him.Getting the balance right on a book about science written to be accessible to a wide range of readers is a challenge, presumable even for such experienced educators but I found that it rarely was overly technical to the point that I lost a handle about what he was talking about nor did it feel too shallow to be interesting or consistently teach me new things throughout. One thing that really stood out to me was how often he went into detail about the history of science from speculation of the neolithic people through to what we know now; bringing the process and the practices of science into a broader context and giving us insight into how much we've learned and how much we undoubtably still have yet to discover. I particularly enjoyed his insights into the clashes of worldviews, theologies and politics and what roles they've played in science throughout our history. It underscores the need for an open mind and the importance of rejecting anti-science ideas in a time when it is so often derided and besieged.All of which is not to say that this wasn't a book about our universe first and foremost — it is — from discussions of gravity to the nature of light, the smallest of particles to the possibilities of a multiverse you will find science and reason throughout.

These statements have not been reviewed by Neil deGrasse Tyson or anyone that is REALLY smart."

And certainly the universe is full of things that can kill the fuck out of us. But the universe is incredibly interesting beyond the obvious negatives of cosmic death.Tyson really breaks apart concepts too complicated for me to explain into little chunks, allowing access for non-astrophysicists. I found his approach witty, interesting, and generally fun.This book is a 5 star book without reservation. You finish the book feeling as if you just sat through the physics class you were too terrified to take in college, but, instead of some professor who is out to give you Fs, your grandfather taught it.I would compare this book with Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", which also attacks the ivy-walled tradition in some science, making it accessible to us liberal arts majors."
446,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2680722-miranda-richards,5,"It's not just about black holes, or even just space! I think the best way to describe this is as a Cosmos-type book. There's a lot of history of science in it, as well as descriptions of the universe. It's diverse in what it covers, and yet it all is well bound up with science. If you liked Cosmos, give Death by Black Hole a read.Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist and is currently the director of the Hayden Planetarium and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. You may have seen him on any number of television shows, such as History Channel's ""The Universe,"" ""The Colbert Report"" and PBS's ""Nova Science Now,"" the latter of which he hosts. He is probably the leading science communicator of the day since Carl Sagan's death. I listened to the Blackstone audiobook version from Audible.com, narrated by Dion Graham, who really managed to capture Dr. Tyson's style."
447,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643358-dimitris-hall,5,"Oh, what a satisfying read this one was... It's a series of essays on many different astronomical subjects that strike the fancy and border science fiction. Astronomy borders science fiction anyway in many cases, so there's even more ground for such forays than ""normal"".From what death by black hole would be like, as the title implies, to the zero-gravitational bowls of our cosmic neighbourhood, to an essay on light-pollution and another one on hollywood astonomy goofs, to the foundations of science, physics and astronomy themselves and their own problematics, to, to, to, and, and and! These are from the top of my head and I read the book more than 2 years ago.Neil deGrasse Tyson seems to be a talented populariser of his field, like Carl Sagan I believe, and I'd like to read more from him. I even want to read DBBH again first chance! If you like astronomy, or want to like astronomy more than you do now, look no further."
448,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13835306-paul-pickell,4," This is a great down-to-Earth book for the lay astrophysicist. Personally, I felt that Tyson accomplished exactly what he set out to do in this prose: provide an accessible understanding of the cosmos at large. In general, the book is a very easy read. Some parts required a deeper understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum or black hole physics, but Tyson is a very accomplished explainer-of-things otherwise, particularly for his field of expertise: star creation and galaxy evolution. Many topics are repeated thoroughly throughout the some 40 chapters, sometimes nearly word-for-word. Tyson is unabashedly an Americanist in his view of science. I leave a star absent because of his no-holds-barred attitude toward ""ancients"" and non-""civilizations"", providing little recognition of the possibility that other humans could have come to similar conclusions throughout history that needn't lived in the ""Northern"" or ""Western hemispheres"". Tyson's work is colonizing, in this way."
449,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3789573-michael-flanagan,4,"Learning about the space has never been such fun. The author's enthusiasm for all things cosmic comes shining through in this book. As a person that has a passing interest in black holes, quasar and other stuff like that. This book provides a great crash course in all things spacey. I now feel a little bit smarter but I am also now in awe of the scientist t past and present that seek to unravel the secrets of our universe. The book is cut up nicely into sections dealing with individual subjects. I did find it a tad annoying that the authors amusing explanations of certain things repeated throughout the book. This to me tarnished this otherwise great read. I particularly liked how he pulled apart common misconceptions like the sun rises in the east and set in the west. Overall this is science delivered in a way us commoners can understand without dumbing it down too much. As for the title I for one am not in favour of meeting my end this way."
450,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2498218-branimir,3,"I have mixed feelings about this book.First, this is not a single work, but a collection of essays. Which is sometimes nice. I enjoyed that because I could read a few essays, make a pause, and continue without a fear of forgetting what was written before. Essays are well-written. They offer nice glimpses into astronomy.And they were, to me, mostly boring.The reason is that I am not the target audience for this book. I am a physicist and have loved astronomy since I was a kid. Therefore, I knew most of the stuff this book writes about.To cut the long story short, I would recommend this book to three types of people:1. astronomy enthusiasts, but not very advanced ones2. scientists who would like to popularize science, because one can see how to write a nice article for general population3. anyone else interested in science and astronomy, but with no formal astronomy/physics background."

Well written and quite amusing at times. At the end he has an essay about the relation of science to religion and gives the standard opinion that the two have nothing to do with one another. He does quote some survey findings that while 90% of Americans say they are religious, 60% of mathematicians say they are and just 30% of physicists. I recall a survey conducted by Scientific American of Nobel Laureates who responded 5% were religious. "
453,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13140459-michaela-ramsey,5,"As expected from Tyson, this book delivers a plethora of interesting information in a whimsical and entertaining voice.

It's written by Neil deGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist who hosted and helped revive Carl Sagan's TV show ""Cosmos"". In this book he explains not only the science of the universe but also presents philosophical questions like: if the universe began at the Big Bang what was there before there was a universe? Whew. Being an astrophysist isn't easy. ""The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it."""

600,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2498218-branimir,3,"I have mixed feelings about this book.First, this is not a single work, but a collection of essays. Which is sometimes nice. I enjoyed that because I could read a few essays, make a pause, and continue without a fear of forgetting what was written before. Essays are well-written. They offer nice glimpses into astronomy.And they were, to me, mostly boring.The reason is that I am not the target audience for this book. I am a physicist and have loved astronomy since I was a kid. Therefore, I knew most of the stuff this book writes about.To cut the long story short, I would recommend this book to three types of people:1. astronomy enthusiasts, but not very advanced ones2. scientists who would like to popularize science, because one can see how to write a nice article for general population3. anyone else interested in science and astronomy, but with no formal astronomy/physics background."
601,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2796168-shea-mastison,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the coolest figures in science today; and this collection of articles is a wonderful introductory lesson in modern cosmology, science, and philosophy. He covers a variety of interesting topics, ranging from: intelligent design, light pollution, quasars, gamma ray explosions, and hypernovas. If you've ever enjoyed his narration/hosting on Nova, this book will certainly please you. An excellent read for anyone interested in popular science and cutting-edge development."
602,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"Interesting essays on subjects in astronomy and astrophysics, plus some on the author's thoughts about this that and other things. Well written and quite amusing at times. At the end he has an essay about the relation of science to religion and gives the standard opinion that the two have nothing to do with one another. He does quote some survey findings that while 90% of Americans say they are religious, 60% of mathematicians say they are and just 30% of physicists. I recall a survey conducted by Scientific American of Nobel Laureates who responded 5% were religious. "
603,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13140459-michaela-ramsey,5,"As expected from Tyson, this book delivers a plethora of interesting information in a whimsical and entertaining voice. As a lover of science, I found this book both fresh and funny. One can easily enjoy the learning experience that is this book, even if they do not enjoy nonfiction, guided by interesting analogies (It is raining and you are bored, so of course you stick a big test tube out the window to collect water) and the perfect level of sassiness expected from Tyson. No one's bookshelf is quite complete without this book. I highly recommend it."
604,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,4,Neil deGrasse Tyson has done a very good job compiling a few good articles into this good book. My only criticism is that it still feels like a bunch of articles that have been pulled together by gravity... to use Tyson's own style.Mr Tyson has humor but a very peculiar one that I didn't connect all the time with. Yet he is a great teacher. I am not a novice in scientific readings about the cosmos but deGrasse Tyson succeeds to teach me many other aspects and concepts I didn't know.And by the way it has been decided: I need a telescope.
605,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4026024-liss-geminireads,3,"To preface this: I LOVE NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. I think Tyson is personable, funny, an obvious genius, and seems like he'd be the kind of ""celebrity"" you could walk up to and say hello. Unfortunately for me this book just didn't entertain me enough to get through it. I think if this book were assigned as scholastic reading i'd have welcomed the break from common text books, but as recreation I need something else. "
606,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2506768-tiffany,3,"There were some very good gems in here, particularly at the end of the book. But, because it was a collection of previously published essays from a magazine, each chapter and section ended up being fairly repetitive of other sections. I didn't entirely mind that since hearing the historical facts repeatedly helps cement them in my head, but it did make for some dry listening. I suspect there are better introductory works to astrophysics."
607,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10383924-gordon,3,"Very well read (audio version) for a technical book with many technical references. Tyson ends the book knocking down straw men on theological approaches to science. The book is also based on articles printed over time and many of his stories and illustrations are repeated in different chapters, i.e., it is somewhat repetitious. However, Tyson has a good sense of humor and has a good ability to communicate difficult concepts with analogies that can be understood by non-physicists."
