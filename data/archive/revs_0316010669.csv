0,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174974-matt-kosinski,2,"Here's Blink in a nutshell:Split decisions can be good; better than decisions where we take a lot of time to carefully weigh our options and use scientific evidence. Except when they're not.Rapid cognition is an exciting and powerful way to use your brain's quick, intuitive capabilities to make stunningly accurate decisions, and can even lead you to have better success in sports, business and politics. Except when it won't.We should learn to trust our snap judgments, even in seemingly complex situations where we don't have a lot of information.Except not really.Basically the book gives scientific and anecdotal evidence on why rapid cognition can be both a good and bad thing, without offering us much advise on how to tell the difference between situations where we should or shouldn't trust our instincts. There are many times when I felt that Gladwell contradicted himself. To support his ""rapid cognition is good"" section of the book, he uses an example of a psychological test where students were able to tell whether or not a professor was good at their job by simply watching a 5 second clip of them lecturing with the sound turned off. The results basically corresponded with impressions given by other students who spent an entire class with those professors - thus proving that there is some mysterious and powerful part of our subconscious that can make accurate snap judgments.But then later on in the book, in the ""rapid cognition is bad"" section, Gladwell warns us that, in general, people instantly like tall, attractive white people better than short, unattractive minorities.WELL DUH! OBVIOUSLY THE STUDENTS RATING THE PROFESSORS WERE BIASED BY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE TALL, WHITE, OR ATTRACTIVE! Mystery solved!While Gladwell brings up some interesting concepts, his book never gels into a coherent whole. I read most of it in under a day and already my rapid cognition is telling me it's not worth finishing."

Such is the case for Blink. This is especially annoying to me, because the book describes my area of research specialization. If you're interested in a fun read, Gladwell is certainly an engaging author. If you're looking for something that accurately describes the research, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. For example, Scott Plous's ""the psychology of judgment and decision making"" (which, despite the title, is not textbook like), or the Heath brothers' ""Made to stick"". "

Blink
 is- what all the stories, case studies, and arguments add up to- an attempt to understand the magical and mysterious thing called Judgement. Its basic premise is: split second decisions (snap judgements); how they can be good and bad. Gladwell suggests split-seconds decisions are better than the decisions where we take considerable time to weigh our choices and options. He points out that our mind figure things, people, et al. in a blink of an eye. And it is often that these snap judgements are much more trustworthy than judgements arrived at rationally. But he does not stop here and goes on further: snap judgements can be misleading, too; he termed it Warren Harding error. He suggested that there are some instinctive processes that prevent us to see clearly; and hence cloud our judgements. Blink is an interesting read. It is very well written, and at the same time engages your attention from the start. And writing is reader friendly, perfectly suitable for a layman..................................................I bought this book because I was intrigued by the subtitle of the book: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking. This subtitle was something Zen like, I felt. And when I read it initially, three years ago, I found it resembling with Zen teachings (and koans). Following are two quotes that mainly convey the spirit: ""They were so focused on the mechanics and the process that they never looked at the problem holistically. In the act of tearing something apart, you lose its meaning.""""When making a decision of minor importance its advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital matters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the decision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life , we should be governed by the deep inner needs of our nature."""
3,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/546634-ashley,5,"I would put this book in the category of ""Freakonomics"" and ""The Tipping Point."" By the same author as the latter title, Malcolm Gladwell, the purpose of this book is to weigh the advantages as well as the disadvantages of the power of the mind's ability to unconsciously leap to conclusions based on what is seen in the proverbial blink of an eye. While I have read some negative reviews of Gladwell's book, mostly citing that he fails to inform the reader how to know when to go with your gut and when not to, as well as arguments that he urges readers not to follow their gut when the gut instincts are politically incorrect, I have to disagree with many of them. I think that Gladwell's objective in ""Blink"" is to make the reader simply aware of their gut instincts and to urge them to consider trusting it more frequently than we do. People tend to make decisions that are supported by a litany of rationalizations and explanations, but do we always really have reasons for why we do or think what we do? Gladwell is arguing that we don’t, and that sometimes it takes the unconscious mind to make those decisions for us. On the flip side, he also argues that sometimes we unconsciously make negative decisions based on that same quick judgment and our predetermined stereotypes, such as with people of other sexes or other races than ourselves. “Blink” was a very complicated book with many facets and it’s hard to explain all of them or review them all without writing an essay. In the end, I think the main goal isn’t perfect knowledge of the subject of thinking without thinking, but rather consideration of it and how it can benefit us or hinder us both individually and as a society."
4,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186516-margaret-ross,3,"I think this book wins my prize for Most Easily Misinterpreted to Serve Personal Agendas. Gladwell gets so into the interesting details of the case he's building, he really doesn't emphasize the final conclusions of the book at all, leaving people to think that the interesting details are the whole point, which is unfortunate. But then again, I'm not 100% sure I got the whole point.Most of the folks I know think that this book is about how a person's gut instincts can be a better read of a situation than a read based on thorough study. Which is an idea that most people love, since they don't want to have to do all that boring study anyhow. What's missing from that analysis is that Gladwell later insists (but only at the very end of the book, and almost in passing) that it's the thorough active training and study of a subject that allow a person to have ""true"" or ""correct"" gut reads. The guy who can tell who's getting divorced after 60 seconds of hearing them talk spent years coding verbal and physical cues in couples, studying them intensely for years before he was able to give his 60 second analysis. The art historians were drawing on a vast body of knowledge when they made their judgment about the statue. The cop who read fear instead of aggression and didn't shoot couldn't name what he was seeing, but he'd seen it before. Then he also says that our gut reactions can be easily colored by training we don't even know is there- our prejudices, whether unknown or unacknowledged- influence or reads of a situation as well.Ultimately, I saw this book as a reaction to and analysis of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, with some tips for how to avoid such future tragedies. In that light, I thought it was interesting and even constructive, but only if you pay close attention to the last chapter. "

The book begins with the story of the Getty Kouros (Archaic Greek sculptors reduced human anatomy and musculature in these statues to decorative patterning on the surface of the marble.), which was a statue brought to the J. Paul Getty Museum in California. It was thought by many experts to be legitimate, but when others first looked at it, their initial responses were skeptical. For example, George Despinis, head of the Acropolis Museum in Athens, said ""Anyone who has ever seen a sculpture coming out of the ground could tell that thing has never been in the ground"".عنوانها:

عنوانهای دیگر که آن بالا نگاشته ام، عنوانهای برگزیده شده ی مترجمین تنها یک کتاب هستند؛ کتابی درباره ی این‌که، چگونه بدون اندیشیدن میاندیشیم، درباره تصمیم‌هایی ست که در یک لحظه گرفته می‌شوند ــ در یک چشم به‌ هم زدن ــ و همه این‌ها به آن سادگی‌ها که به‌ دیده می‌آیند نیستند؛ چرا برخی از افراد، تصمیم‌ گیرهای والایی هستند، در حالی‌که برخی دیگر ناتوانند؟ چرا برخی پیرو غرایزشان هستند، و برنده می‌شوند، در حالی‌که عده‌ ای دیگر، در اشتباه، دست‌ و پا می‌زنند؟ مغز ما واقعا در اداره، در کلاس، در آشپزخانه، و در خانه، چگونه کار می‌کند؟ و چرا اغلب بهترین تصمیمات، آن‌هایی هستند که توضیحشان برای دیگران، ناممکن است؟ در کتاب «یک نگاه» با روان‌شناسی آشنا می‌شویم، که می‌داند چطور با مشاهده ی چند دقیقه‌ ای صحبت زوج‌ها، طول زندگی زناشویی آن‌ها را، پیش‌بینی کند؛ مربی تنیسی، که می‌داند پیش از اصابت راکت با توپ، آیا بازیکن خطا می‌کند یا خیر؛ متخصصان عتیقه‌ شناسی، که با یک نگاه، اصل یا تقلبی بودن شی‌ء را، تشخیص می‌دهند؛ هم‌چنین شکست‌های بزرگ قضاوت در یک نگاه نیز در این کتاب شرح داده می‌شوند: انتخاب «وارن

بلکه کسانی هستند که هنر تمام عیار «برش نازک» را دارند، یعنی از بین انواع وسژگیهای مربوط به یک مسئله، اصلی‌ترین آن‌ها را جدا می‌کنندنقل نمونه متن: «پیش درآمد: مجسمه ای که اصل نبود؛ در سپتامبر 1983میلادی، یک دلال آثار هنری به نام جیان فرانکو به چینا به موزه پاول گتی کالیفرنیا مراجعه کرد؛ او ادعا میکرد مجسمه مرمرینی در اختیار دارد که متعلق به شش قرن پیش از میلاد است؛ این مجسمه معروف به کورس بود ـ مجسمه ای از یک مرد جوان برهنه ایستاده با دستانی از دوطرف آویخته و پای چپ جلو نهاده؛ تا آن زمان در حدود دویست مجسمه کورسی از حفاریهای باستانشناسی یا گورهای قدیمی به دست آمده بود که اغلب آنها در هنگام اکتشاف یا متلاشی شده بودند و یا بدجوری آسیب دیده بودند، اما این یکی تقریبا سالم مانده بود؛ ارتفاع این مجسمه نزدیک به دومتر و بیست و پنج سانتیمتر بود و شفافیتی داشت که آن را از بقیه مجسمه های اکتشافی متمایز میکرد؛ این یک کشف خارق العاده بود و مبلغ پیشنهادی به چینا زیر ده میلیون دلار بود؛ موزه گتی با احتیاط وارد عمل شد؛ مجسمه کورس را به امانت گرفت و تحقیق دقیقی را شروع کرد؛ آیا مجسمه با بقیه مجسمه های کورسی همخوانی داشت؟ جواب به ظاهر آری بود؛ شیوه ی ساخت آن به نظر مشابه مجسمه کورس آناویسوس در موزه ملی باستان شناسی آتن بود، و معنایش این بود که با زمان و مکان خاصی مطابقت داشت؛ این مجسمه از کجا و چه زمانی پیدا شده بود؟ هیچکس به طور دقیق نمیدانست؛ اما به چینا مدارکی به اداره حقوقی موزه گتی ارائه داد که حاوی تاریخچه اخیر آن بود؛ طبق مدارک موجود، کورس از سال 1930میلادی در کلکسیون خصوصی یک پزشک سوییسی به نام لوفن برگر نگهداری میشد، که خود او نیز آن را از دلال معروف آثار هنری یونانی به نام روسس خریده بود؛ برای بررسیهای دقیق، زمین شناسی به نام استنلی مارگولیس از دانشگاه کالیفرنیا به موزه آمد و به مدت دو روز سطح مجسمه را با یک استریو میکروسکوپ بسیار حساس مورد آزمایش قرار داد و بعد از زیر زانوی راست مجسمه تکه ای به قطر یک سانتیمتر و طول دو سانتیمتر جدا کرد و با استفاده از میکروسکوپ الکترونی، اشعه انکساری ایکس و اشعه فلورسنسی ایکس به تجزیه آن پرداختمارگولیس به این نتیجه رسید که مجسمه از سنگ مرمر دُلومیت معدن قدیمی کیپ وتی در جزیره تاسوس ساخته شده، و سطح مجسمه با لایه نازکی از کربنات آهک پوشیده شده است ــ که به گفته وی از اهمیت خاصی برخوردار بود ــ زیرا دُلومیت تنها در طول قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند تبدیل به کربنات آهک شود؛ به عبارت دیگر مجسمه شیئی قدیمی بود و تقلبی نبودموزه گتی از این مسئله خشنود بود، و چهارده ماه پس از شروع تحقیقات با خریدن مجسمه موافقت شد؛ در پاییز 1986میلادی مجسمه برای اولین بار به نمایش گذاشته شد؛ نیویورک تایمز حکایت آنرا در صفحه ی اول خود آورد؛ چند ماه بعد متصدی اموال عتیقه ی موزه، ماریون ترو، گزارشی پرشور و بلندبالا از دستیابی موزه به مجسمه، برای مجله برلینگتون نوشت: «اکنون کورس با قامتی برافراشته و دستانی مشت شده حیات مطمئن خویش را که برترین خصلت او و برادرانش است ابراز میکند.» و سپس پیروزمندانه نتیجه گیری کرد: «او چه خدا باشد و چه انسان تجسم کامل نیروی تابناک بلوغ هنری غرب است.»؛ با تمام این احوال مشکلی وجود داشت؛ مجسمه به نظر اصل نمیآمد، اولین کسیکه به این مشکل اشاره کرد، فردی بود به نام فدریکو زِری، مورخ هنرشناس ایتالیایی، که عضو هیئت امنای موزه نیز بود؛ وقتی «زِری» در دسامبر 1983میلادی به محل نگهداری مجسمه رفت، تا آن را ببیند، بی اختیار به ناخنهای آن خیره شد؛ البته نمیخواست توضیحی برای این مسئله بدهد، اما به نظرش یک جای کار ایراد داشت؛ نفر بعدی «اِوِلین هریسون»، یکی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی بود، که هنگام معامله نهایی، در «لس آنجلس» بود؛ او چنین به خاطر میآورد: آن زمان آرتور هافتن متصدی موزه بود، و ما را برای بازدید برد؛ او با یک حرکت پارچه روی مجسمه را پس زد و گفت، «خُب، این هنوز مال ما نیست اما تا چند هفته دیگر خواهد شد.»؛ و من گفتم: «خیلی متاسفم که این را میشنوم.»، هریسون چه دیده بود؟ خودش نمیداند؛ در همان لحظه اول، وقتی «هافتن» پارچه را کنار زده بود، آنچه «هریسون» حس کرده بود، یک الهام بود، یک احساس غریزی از اینکه چیزی آن وسط اشکال داشت؛چند ماه بعد «هافتن»، «تامس هاوینگ» مدیر سابق موزه «متروپولتین» را برای بازدید از مجسمه، به کارگاه مرمّت موزه برد؛ «هاوینگ» همیشه اولین کلمه ای را که با دیدن چیزی از ذهنش میگذرد یادداشت میکند؛ و هرگز فراموش نمیکند اولین کلمه ای که با دیدن «کورس» از ذهنش گذشت چه بود؛هاوینگ میگوید: «آن کلمه «تازه» بود ــ «تازه»، و «تازه» برای مجسمه ای که دوهزار سال قدمت دارد کلمه مناسبی نیست.»؛ «هاوینگ» بعدها که راجع به آن لحظه فکر کرد، فهمید چرا چنین کلمه ای به ذهنش خطور کرده بود: «من در سیسیلی حفاری کرده بودم، جاییکه تکه ها و قطعاتی از این دست پیدا میشوند، اما این یکی به هیچ کدام شبیه نبود؛ به نظر میرسید این مجسمه کورس از توی یکی از همین قوطیهای قهوه مرغوب استارباکس بیرون آمده باشد!» «هاوینگ» رو به «هافتن» پرسید، «آیا برای آن پولی هم پرداخته اید؟» و وقتی با چهره متعجب هافتن مواجه شد، گفت، «اگر پرداخته اید سعی کنید پس بگیرید و معامله را فسخ کنید.»؛ مسئولان موزه «گتی» کم کم داشتند نگران میشدند، بنابراین سمپوزیوم ویژه ای در مورد کورس در یونان برپا کردند؛ مجسمه را بسته بندی کردند و به یونان فرستادند، و از متخصصان ارشد مجسمه شناسی دعوت کردند؛ اینبار زمزمه یاس و دلهره بلندتر به گوش میرسید؛ «هریسون» در کنار مردی ایستاده بود که نامش «جرج دِس پینیس» بود، و رئیس موزه «آرکوپولیس آتن»؛ «جرج دس پینیس» نگاهی به کورس انداخت و رنگش پرید؛ او رو به هریسون گفت: «هر کس یکبار در عمرش مجسمه ای را که از دل خاک بیرون کشیده شده، دیده باشد میتواند تشخیص دهد، این یکی زیرزمین نبوده است.» «جورجیوس دانتاس»، رئیس جمعیت باستانشناسی آتن، به محض اینکه مجسمه را دید تنش یخ کرد؛ او گفت: «وقتی برای اولین بار کورس را دیدم احساس کردم انگار شیشه ای بین من و مجسمه کشیده شده است.»؛در سمپوزیوم، «آنجلوس دِلی وریاس» مدیر موزه «بناکی آتن» نیز گفته های «دانتاس» را تایید کرد؛ او به تفصیل از تناقض بین سبک ساخت مجسمه، و این واقعیت که مرمر آن از معادن تاسوس استخراج شده است، صحبت کرد، و سپس به اصل مطلب رسید؛ چرا او فکر میکرد که مجسمه تقلبی است؟ زیرا وقتی برای اولین بار به آن نگاه انداخته بود موجی از ادراک و دافعه ی حسی در او برانگیخته شده بود؛ زمانیکه سمپوزیوم به پایان رسید در بین اکثر مدعوین این اتفاق نظر وجود داشت، که کورس ابدا آن چیزی نیست که تصور میشدموزه گتی با تمامی متخصصان و وکلای خود و ماهها بررسی دقیق به یک نتیجه رسیده بود، و برخی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی ــ تنها با یک نگاه و احساس دافعه حسی ــ به نتیجه ای دیگر؛ حق با کدام یک بود؟ برای مدتی هیچ چیز مشخص نبود؛ کورس تبدیل به مسئله ای شده بود که متخصصان هنری در کنفرانسهای مختلف بر سر آن بحث و جدل میکردند؛ اما بعد، اندک اندک، ابهامات ماجرای گتی شروع به روشن شدن نمود؛ برای مثال نامه هایی که وکلای گتی به دقت پیگیری کرده بودند و مشخص میکرد که کورس متعلق به یک پزشک سوییسی بوده، جعلی از آب درآمد؛ یکی از نامه هایی که به تاریخ 1952میلادی بود دارای یک کدپستی بود، که تا بیست سال پس از آن تاریخ هنوز وجود خارجی نداشت؛ نامه دیگری که تاریخ 1955میلادی را داشت، به یک حساب بانکی اشاره داشت، که تا تاریخ 1963میلادی هنوز افتتاح نشده بود؛ در اصل نتیجه ی ماهها تحقیق فقط این شد که کورس موزه گتی همان سبک مجسمه آناویسوس را داشت، اما این نتیجه گیری نیز مورد شک بود؛هرچه متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی دقیقتر به آن نگاه میکردند بیشتر به التقاطی بودن آن پی میبردند؛ هر قسمت از اندام مجسمه مربوط به زمان و مکان متفاوتی بود؛ اندام باریک مرد جوان بیشتر شبیه کورس تنه آ بود که در موزه مونیخ نگهداری میشد، و موهای خوش حالتش شبیه کورس موزه متروپولتین نیویورک؛ و در این بین پاهایش چیزی نبودند جز هنر مدرن، از قضا این مجسمه از همه بیشتر شبیه مجسمه شکسته و کوچکتری بود که در سال 1990میلادی، توسط یک هنرشناس بریتانیایی در سوییس پیدا شده بود؛ هر دو مجسمه از یک سنگ مرمر مشابه و با یک سبک تراشیده شده بود؛ اما کورس سوییسی متعلق به گذشته نبود، بلکه در اوایل دهه هشتاد در کارگاهی در رم ساخته شده بود؛ پس تحقیقات علمی که مشخص میکرد سطح مجسمه کورس تنها پس از قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند به چنین شکلی درآید چه؟ خوب آن نتایج همچندان قطعی نبودند؛ طبق آزمایشها و بررسیهای بعدی زمینشناس دیگری به این نتیجه رسید، که با استفاده از کپک سیب زمینی، میتوان در عرض چند ماه سطح مجسمه مرمر دلومیتی را به شکل کهنه و قدیمی درآورد؛ در کاتالوگ موزه گتی تصویری از مجسمه کورس چاپ شده که زیر آن نوشته شده «حدود ۵۳۰سال قبل از میلاد، یا، مدرن جعلی.»؛ زمانیکه «فدریکو زری» و «اِوِلین هریسون» و «تامس هاوینگ» و «جورجیوس دانتاس» ــ و خیلیهای دیگر ــ با یک نگاه به مجسمه دچار دافعه حسی شدند مطمئنا حق داشتند؛ آنها در همان دو ثانیه اول ـ در یک نگاه ـ به شناختی از ماهیت مجسمه دست یافتند که تیم تخصصی موزه گتی پس از چهارده ماه تحقیق هنوز به آن نرسیده بود؛ یک نگاه کتابی است درباره ی همان دو ثانیه نخست.»؛ پایان نقلا. شربیانی"
6,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"O, to have the writing career of Malcolm Gladwell. The man pulls interesting case studies from academic research and news headlines, spins it into a book under a general theme, and blammo! He has a bestseller. This formula worked for him with The Tipping Point and then Blink. Blink is a compelling read, despite its weak overall theme, which is that sometimes split-second decisions are good and sometimes they're bad, and we need to learn when to trust our first impressions and when to discount them (except there's no real way to make that distinction). The book is a pleasure to read simply because of its case studies. Gladwell throws in so many topics — art, politics, marriage, consumer testing, athletes, war, police shootings, music — that there is bound to be something engaging for everyone. (After reading another one of Gladwell's peppy articles in The New Yorker, my husband joked, ""Gladwell thinks he can make ANYTHING seem interesting."")After finishing Blink, I feel like I've learned something important, but I'm not sure exactly what, other than that Gladwell has a very charmed career.My rating: 3.5 stars rounded up to 4"
7,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,3,"This was a big best-seller for Gladwell. He posits that much of the time we make decisions, reach conclusions in a sort of pre-conscious manner that he calls “thin-slicing.” That means taking a very small sample, a thin slice, and making a decision immediately based on that information. However, it is the case that the ability to evaluate that slice is fed by a lifetime of experience. It is not simply, as some, including President Bush the second, might believe, that using one’s gut, in the absence of years and years of preparation, is as valid a way of reaching decisions as taking the longer route of careful analysis of available data. No, no, no."
8,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"I generally distrust anyone who says that they ‘go-with-their-gut’. But when the company I work for announced a major decision a few years back, I instantly said, “This is going to be a huge mistake.” Smart people had examined the deal backwards and forwards for months and thought it was a great idea. I had a bad feeling about it that I could only later explain, and I was far from the only one. And we were right. The entire thing turned out to be a huge disaster. I kept thinking about that incident when I read Blink. The book has a pretty obvious point. People make snap decisions that they can’t consciously explain. Sometimes these decisions are correct and amazing based on the limited amount of information available. Art experts who instantly know a statue is fake despite scientific tests indicating otherwise. A fireman who appears to be fighting a routine small fire suddenly orders his men out without really knowing why and the floor collapses a second later. And sometimes these decisions can be wrong and have tragic consequences. Four cops think a guy has a gun when he’s pulling his wallet out and shoot him multiple times.We’ve all made quick decisions and later been amazed at how good or bad they turned out, but what makes Blink interesting is that Gladwell does some examination of the science behind how we arrive at these conclusions, and his thoughts on how the data we’re processing can either give us incredible insight or lead us horribly wrong.Thankfully, Gladwell is not making an argument against logical thinking or analyzing a problem. What he is doing is pointing out that instinct or intuition can be a powerful tool IF the people involved have trained themselves to make good decisions, and if we know when to trust it. He’s got a lot of great examples of doctors, military officers and police officers who often have to make life-or-death decisions in a matter of seconds with limited information. They have to trust their instincts, and Gladwell makes some common sense points that the right kind of training and education can make a huge difference. He contrasts the story of the four New York cops who killed the guy with a wallet versus a patrolman who did not fire on someone who actually had a gun but was attempting to surrender it.What made this book fun to read was the variety of examples that Gladwell uses and the scientific research done with them. Art dealers, doctors, marriage counselors, cops, military officers, car salesmen, a tennis coach, and classical musicians are all used as examples of the strengths and weaknesses of snap decisions. There’s also some simple experiments included that let you play along at home. This is a book that will make you think about the way you think."
9,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/344817-mackenzie,2,"so i bought this book in boston's logan airport about 10 minutes before i had to board a flight to seattle. the bookstore was limited; i didn't want to have to work to get interested. and the first 100 pages or so did the trick... until i realized that gladwell wasn't so much building an argument as telling stories about a certain topic. don't get me wrong, i finished the book. later. back in boston, on the T. and it did cover some interesting studies, or i wouldn't have done so. but i suspect the author might've lacked the attention span necessary to lend this book any coherence. meh. it was basically a series of loosely related tidbits about snap-judgments, none of which led me to conclude that instinct or intuition is significantly more or less reliable than rational deliberation. if a point could be gleaned and summarized, i guess it would be that with the right thin-slice of information, under the right conditions, instantaneous judgements can be spot-on. shrug. the best i can say about this book is that there were a couple of well-set-up digs at the bush administration and i discovered the music of kenna, who's pretty cool. i also learned that when my girlfriend's eyes get even a little wider, it means she's angry."
10,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak,4,"Much like the reason behind my majoring in Economics, I like Gladwell because he opens my mind to new ideas and new ways to think. Much like Economics, I believe he's far from perfect, but I really enjoy viewing the world through his lens. In just about anything, when people start acting as if there is only one way to do something, I stop listening to them. This goes for many things, but especially politics. If you DO, however, find someone who is omniscient and knows exactly how every policy will turn out in the end, please let me know. I may listen to their one way of seeing the world. Otherwise ...What I got from Blink is that there is a lot to our instant thoughts and feelings and many times much more than we give them credit. The traditional wisdom is to plan and make huge weighty decisions based on every single bit of information that we have at our fingertips (which is just about everything, google!). This is actually a big reason my wife and I get into ... disagreements (we'll go with that). She likes to plan everything down to the last detail and I like to be a bit more relaxed.So it would seem that this book is a big proponent of my way of doing things, but it turns out it's not so much.We should trust our gut-instinct, says Blink, if we have many hours of experience in said realm of understanding because we have developed the skills to make sense of those small details and because we have the ability to ""thin slice."" Gladwell also makes the point that not always can we trust our gut-intinct, however, because our gut-instinct tends to be racist, even when we are not in fact consciously racist. Also, our instincts can get overwhelmed by heightened arousal, such as when people can't even dial 911 in an emergency because their senses are overloaded.But then again, you can practice and have these types of unconscious reactions mitigated.The interesting story-telling style of introducing these topics is, of course, what really gets me. It's the stories that are often unbelievable that have me clamoring for more, just like in Outliers (although I think Outliers was a little better written) and I would assume his other books. He goes into why The Getty art museum spent millions on a fake kouros (Greek statue) and why cops probably aren't racial profiling when they beat people like Rodney King, but because of a few key mistakes such as allowing their unconscious to get overwhelmed and also because they were a group of officers instead of just one.He talks about people who can listen to a couple and tell when they should start talking to their lawyers and people who have developed the actual abilities that are shown in the TV show ""Lie to Me."" How looking at a person's room for 5 minutes may give a complete stranger a better picture of a person than a good friend. I've always loved these types of explanations for things. There's the old wisdom we have and the wisdom we assume when we don't have any other way to describe a particular event and which is completely wrong. I love thinking new ideas, even when it's old news and that's why I'll keep coming back to Gladwell."
11,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"Elsewhere, in one of my other recent reviews, a GoodReads friend (Richard) told me that he had become less infatuated with this book after reading a review by a specialist in the field who gave it a drubbing. I was worried that knowing this might ruin this book for me – but it has not. I really enjoyed this one too. This is the third of Gladwell’s books I’ve read in quick succession and this contained lots of information about things that have made me think and sparked my interest to learn more. It may well be that Gladwell’s style does not appeal to an expert in the field – and that is quite likely to be true, but I’ve found that it is often the case that I’ve been introduced to themes by popularisers and later went on to read more deeply on a subject. I rarely condemn those who introduce me to fascinating topics – and this is a fascinating topic.I’m not going to do a full review, but rather quickly talk about wine. While he was talking about coke and about taste tests I was thinking about wine. He makes the point that when asked to judge jam people do nearly as well as the experts if they are just asked which jam they liked the most, but do much worse than experts if asked to explain why they graded them in the order that they did. That is, if they have to talk about texture and sweetness and citrus flavours – people change how they judge jam and end up picking the worst jam rather than the best. This is because we don’t really know what ‘texture’ is and so trying to slot jams into categories that we don’t really understand means we are most likely to stuff up and confuse ourselves. Now, wine. I wonder if anyone has ever done a test at cellar doors to see what people end up buying and if they pick the nicest wine for the price, or do they buy vinegar instead? I wouldn’t mind betting that there would be something similar happening here – and if you are with someone who says things like, “Oh yes, fruity, but with a back-taste of coal tar” you might end up buying something that is quite disgusting. You know, unless you actually have some idea of what you are talking about, it might be best to shut up and drink the wine.That is the point of this book – learning when to trust your “immediate reactions” and when to question them. I think there is much in this book that is worth knowing and much that is fascinatingly interesting. (The stuff about unconscious racism is so important that everyone should be forced to read this for that alone). But with Richard, I am a little concerned that an expert in the field didn't like this book. All the same, the expert does recommend Made to Stick so I guess that can be the next book I read.There is – as is proven by Dylan Moran – only one way to pick wine:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2gGf..."
12,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,4,"I reread this after realizing I couldn't remember enough to compare with Kahneman`s book. They are mostly aligning, only Kahneman suggests against making snap judgements and relying more on evidence whereas Gladwell gives views from both sides and stays impartial.Blink is about unconscious decision making. Our unconscious side is fascinating, because it seems to be the one that holds the strings most of the time; making very fast decisions, watching out for any threat to our existence. However when our drives (the motivators of unconscious) are in conflict, ourrational mind is quick to get in. The rational mind is also there to make corrections, and making plans. So it seems that mostly we are on autopilot for unimportant things, and also when we have to do something at lightening speed. But at other times even if there is an urge to act instinctively, one should act relying on data rather than on instinct."

While I enjoyed The Tipping Point more, I have to say that I am happy to have read this after that particular chapter. This is not to say it's the only one I found interesting, because at least one other one was quite fascinating for me.I do plan to read more books by Gladwell in the future."
15,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1090620-ed,2,"I didn't learn much from this book that I did not already know. I am beginning to suspect that Malcolm Gladwell is not writing books that uncover valuable facts that we should know, but rather is writing books that restate facts we already know but in an interesting way.I like his anecdotal stories very much which is why I finished the book - hoping for more stories. When he lays out the facts, though, his writing is no more interesting than any other scientific author. So, in summary, what we have is a talented writer making certain scientific findings available to a much wider audience than usual. Bravo! However if you want to learn something new, this book or his previous effort, The Tipping Point, is not where to go to find it. I imagine, if I read it, I will find The Outliers, his latest effort, to be similarly constructed.Blink's content is easily summarized. First impressions are often more accurate than conclusions arrived at after much study and analysis. Be careful, though, because first impressions can be troublesome because of people's prejudices. Got it in 254 pages. He does come up with an interesting term, ""thin slicing"", to describe the process of taking in a first impression. Maybe learning that term made reading the whole book worthwhile. Maybe."
16,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"A really great study on how important the first few seconds of anything can be, in any particular situation. Be it that you're an art expert who instantly knows an object is fake, or a police man who thinks that the victim is pulling a gun out of their pocket rather than a wallet, it's very clear that human beings do have this constant auto-pilot running, an unconscious ""survival mode"" that gives us most of the clues we might need in the ""blink"" of an eye, and sometimes those clues might be wrong."
17,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"Gladwell continues his exploration of counter-intuitive ideas about decision-making in BLINK! He opens with a 1983 incident at the J. Paul Getty Museum. The Museum acquired a rare statue from the Greek archaic period. To this day, the Museum maintains that the authenticity of the statue is uncertain. At the time, however, the Museum was certain enough to acquire the piece for just under $10 million. Documentation, and scientific analysis had been relied on as support. However, numerous experts including Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas Hoving pronounced it a fake. It was an intuitive pronouncement which presaged problems later uncovered with both the documentation and scientific analysis. This is the first of many stories Gladwell uses to illustrate how an intuitive reaction can trump logic and analysis.Among the factors that cloud logic is something he calls the adaptive unconscious. It's an unrecognized emotional bias. In the Getty example, the officials wanted the piece to be authentic. It would have been a spectacular acquisition for a newly established museum. This desire diverted critical scrutiny of the supporting evidence. Such an adaptation need not even be emotion based. In an explanation of priming, Gladwell cites psychological studies that illustrate the subconscious effect of pre-conditioning through word lists. Extrapolating from these examples, one might conclude that the casual reader will be highly influenced when reviewing a book by his mood or even surroundings at the time of reading.Gladwell explores other impediments to logical thinking, logic being a type of perceptual filter. Face recognition, he points out, occurs in a completely different part of the brain, and is an integrated reaction as opposed to the kind of multi-step processing that occurs in dealing with language. Athletic and musical achievement rely on these non-verbal neural processes. His own example cites Paul Van Ripper's success against a team backed by the Pentagon's most sophisticated computers in a war games exercise. The Pentagon team was actually hampered in their decision making by information overload. Initial reaction, Gladwell points out is not always accurate. He tries to explore this downside as well by citing studies on bias. Gladwell is an entertaining storyteller as well as an energetic researcher. He draws examples from market research, Chancellorsville in the Civil War, the assessment of heart attacks at Cook County Hospital, speed dating, fire fighting, the auditioning of professional musicians, and the Diallo Incident in the Bronx to illustrate his points. By drawing from such a wide variety of experience, he insures the interest of a broad audience in this book. NOTE: It's always fun to re-encounter characters from other books. I knew of Thomas Hoving from his book, KING OF THE CONFESSORS. The idea of thin-slice thinking was also explored in HOW WE DECIDE, by Jonah Lehrer. The deconstruction of flavor is discussed from a neurophysiological standpoint in Gordon Shepherd's NEUROGASTRONOMY. "

19,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,2,"I was really expecting more from this book. I've heard mostly good things about Gladwell, and he had a pretty interesting TED talk, and I enjoy almost anything to do with the brain, so...why not?The book certainly brought up a lot of interesting ideas and did a good job of discussing the different elements that go into the snap decisions that we make every day. And it's probably worth a read for many of the stories and experiments related. But for the most part this book really failed to impress. More than that though, it failed at being a coherent analysis of what goes on in the human brain when we make snap judgments. Gladwell alternates between telling us to trust and accept this ""mysterious phenomena"" that allows us to make these unconscious snap judgments and warning us against the use of these snap judgments. One moment he advises against the idea that we need to slowly collect data and weigh options to make the most informed opinion and provides examples where too much thinking and information leads us astray, and in the next moment gives us examples of how snap judgments sometimes go horribly wrong. And he leaves us with no clear sense of how to use this new found information to make better decisions and judgments in our own lives. Do I trust my insights because my rational brain will fool me, or do I mistrust my instincts because of the inherent bias contained within them? If Gladwell knows he sure didn't tell me.One example of somewhere where I think he didn't analyze the situation enough was when he talked about the Wisconsin Card Sorting task (pick cards from one of two decks, one deck tends towards bad and the other towards good outcomes). He focused solely on how the unconscious mind was aware of the pattern (which deck was bad and which was good) long before the conscious mind was aware of it when making decisions. And this was shown by the fact that sweating occurred when choosing from the ""bad"" deck before the subject knew why (or was even aware of it). What he fails to mention about all this is that the reason for this is because we are designed to be ""risk averse"". It is not because we are making brilliant snap judgments, or that our brains have ""learned"" the rules before we are aware of it. From an evolutionary perspective it pays off more to learn from our mistakes than learn from our victories. Mistakes are costly. This is why bad memories are more salient than happy ones. The sweating that occurs is a physiological indicator of and means of prompting the organism to stay away. It's not even that this explanation is in contradiction to Gladwell's; it is that it IS an explanation for the phenomena Gladwell describes, one easily at Gladwells' disposal. Two other aspects of this book stuck out as major frustrations for me:1) Gladwell spends a lot of time early on talking about the mysterious nature of our ability to thin slice (make accurate snap judgments based on very little information) and urges us to accept this. To his credit, he does attempt to demystify this somewhat later on, but not enough in my opinion. His first example is of a museum that purchased an expensive sculpture which all the data and scientists evaluated as legitimate, but which experts in the field immediately saw as a fake without being able to put into words why. It's purposefully misleading to label this as some sort of mysterious phenomena. For instance, it's important to remember that these people were experts. An amateur would not and could not make this same snap judgment because they don't have the training to. This ability didn't magically appear, it came from learning and training and synaptic change. These experts learned over time. They studied types of stone, and different styles, and everything else that goes into understanding their field. And this process created memories...synaptic change within their brains. And there exists a system (or systems) in the brain that can make decisions based on that neuronal structure without conscious awareness. Shortcuts so to speak. But these shortcuts are a product of that neuronal structure, which is a product of that synaptic change, which is a product of the learning the individual did over time. It's misleading to call this mysterious. What's important, and more interesting in my opinion, is figuring out the underlying processes that allow this to happen. 2) Towards the end of the book Gladwell discusses how our stress response leads us to make all sorts of bad decisions. He talks about autism and how autistic people can't mind read (don't have theories of other minds) and how this affects their interpretation of events around them and of the world in general. He compares what happens to people in stressful situations to this, that during these situations, because the fight or flight response has taken over, people have tunnel vision and can no longer ""read minds"" and thus make all sorts of mistakes and bad decisions because they are focusing on the wrong things. My issue is that he, incomprehensibly, makes a literal, as opposed to metaphorical, connection with autism. He argues that during these times we become ""temporarily autistic"". While it's true that one aspect of our behavior becomes similar to an aspect of an autistic individuals behavior during these times, it seems like a pretty ridiculous statement to make as a broad generalization. He spends quite a bit of time talking about this and I don't think it does anyone any good.In the end I think I was most disappointed by the fact that all the elements to create a good book WERE present here, and the failure is due in large part to how he puts it all together and his ability to analyze all the disparate ideas properly (insert irony here). Evolution has built into us shortcuts to react quickly to stimuli in our environment. Our experience, whether broadly cultural or personal, prunes, enhances, changes those built in shortcuts as we go through life. Some develop as unfair biases towards people of different races. Some develop as we become experts in a subject. Thus some can be trusted and some can't. Our brains can't tell the difference between fact and fiction, only between experience and non experience, and so it's important to be aware of what kind of decision making goes on under the surface and what factors are involved in those decisions so we can be more aware of whether to trust them or not. Other factors can affect decision making, such as our emotional state due to the physiological changes that take place during those times, and this too is important to understand because it radically alters our perception during those times. The most important thing to remember is that experience translates into instinct through synaptic change, and through work and training we can increase the effectiveness of our gut reactions and snap decisions, but due to biases and our altered states during emotional situations those instincts should not always be trusted outright. There you go Malcolm Gladwell, please feel free to use this in the next printing. No citation necessary. "
20,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Malcolm Gladwell engagingly writes about how decisions made in a blink--snap judgments--can be very good. A series of entertaining anecdotes and psychological studies show that first impressions can be good in some cases, especially in areas where people have experience. He also writes about experts who analyze facial expressions, and how autistic people have trouble making certain types of judgment calls.But then he goes on to show how our unconscious mind can also be very prejudiced. Tall men are more likely to become CEOs than short men. Using Warren Harding as an example, he shows that people may vote for a political candidate because they look presidential. Women are less likely to be offered positions in some orchestras unless the auditions are held with the competitors behind a screen, so they are just evaluated on their playing ability. He also includes stories about police officers making snap judgments, and the judicial system handing out longer sentences to minorities. There were some examples that supported decisions made quickly by the subconscious level, and other examples that showed certain decisions were better when we slowed down and consciously gave things a little more thought. Experience played a big part in having good judgment making quick decisions. Gladwell does not get into how the brain works in making decisions. The book is interesting and entertaining, but it raises as many questions as it answers. 3.5 stars."

Even as a general reader, I find this book says a lot of things but does not actually tell you what it actually wants to address. But I love this book for totally different reasons. Firstly, I love case studies with interesting results written by someone who can write in a way you will find the whole experience exhilarating. Secondly, this guy deserves a five star because he is making less known but thought-provoking scientific studies to a much wider audience. Thirdly, nowhere it is mentioned in the title it is a book which teaches you how to think without thinking so it is completely understandable why it shows us both the advantages and disadvantages of snap decision making and it completely leaves to the reader to decide when to do what. Finally, I love non-fiction which uses a lot of anecdotes to state a fact rather just directly stating the fact it wants to address. I recommend it to anyone who loves to read about interesting psychological studies. "

23,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/337591-zinta,5,"Where does it all go, after you are done experiencing the experience, thinking the thought, feeling the feeling? Nothing is ever lost. The subconscious is like a vast warehouse, limitless, in fact, and as Malcolm Gladwell illustrates in Blink, we access all that is stored in that warehouse with every blinking and waking moment.Usually, we call this instant access - gut instinct. Or, the inner voice of wisdom. Instinct, however, is nothing magical or mysterious. It is simply our accumulated and stored knowledge over a lifetime. If there was ever an argument for listening to those who have some serious and well-lived years under their belts, this is it. Blink illustrates with numerous and widely varied examples how life experience, the more the better, contributes to our ability to make quick, yet sound decisions. In fact, the quicker, the better.Blink is about what the author calls ""thin slicing."" He defines this process as the moment of time in which we all make snap judgments. Two seconds, two minutes ... and we make an assessment of a situation or a person or a circumstance. The fascinating thing is - these snap judgments are, more often than not, precise ones. It is when we begin to over analyze and rationalize that we tend to go awry. The trick is to allow the accumulated wisdom rise up and do its magic, trust in it.Then again ...Gladwell never does make a concluding statement in his book, and perhaps it is up to the reader to decide (do it quickly?), but his many fascinating examples and his reports on various studies can lead one to think these snap judgments are the way to go - or, then again, thinker beware. For all the many situations in which that moment of initial wisdom is uncannily precise, there are other times that our deeply ingrained biases muck up the clarity of that process. Gladwell cites data to illustrate how stereotypes, for instance, persist - no matter how gallant our conscious efforts to overcome them. Telling yourself you don't really think what you think simply won't work. Only exposure to experiences, or positive visualizations, will change the false ideas and images our subconscious has absorbed over time. All of which is a strong argument for ""garbage in, garbage out."" That is, be careful of what entertainment you choose (e.g. pornographic images, violent movies or games, etc.), because no matter how hard your conscious mind tries to guide you toward decisions and behavior that is more appropriate, your subconscious will always, but always win out.The idea of what you present to your eye is what you will later project out to the world is a convincing one, as the author finds himself unable to beat the test on stereotypes when he has to react quickly. Only exposure to more positive images over time can change his test results and dislodge his prejudices.Gladwell discusses this phenomena of instant response-true response in a manner of ways. How patients respond to their doctors (we sue the physician who has a lousy bedside manner, even if more skilled, but remain loyal to the physician who spends as little as three extra minutes talking with us); how facial expressions, when viewed on slowed down video, will without fail, always reveal deceit (there are facial movements that arise from our subconscious that we cannot control, and no matter how quickly we think we have our facial mask in place, there is always that instant that our faces tell the truth); the intricacies of marketing and advertisement and why the obvious ad, even when based on feedback of focus groups, may not be the effective choice; how military decisions by experienced military leaders are successful, but fail miserably when they are constrained by strategic analysis; how micro-managing in workplaces can only lead to mediocrity while suppressing creativity and innovation; how speed dating may be most effective in finding potential lifelong connections (we read about research that can pick out successful, longterm relationships in observing as little as two minutes of interaction between a couple - and no, it isn't the couple that argues that breaks apart); how our societal subconscious biases for certain physical characteristics, such as height or gender, often mislead us to make dangerously faulty snap judgments (Gladwell observes that most of our leaders are tall and male, and that our corporate world pays tall men higher salaries, factoring dollars down to the inch, regardless of intelligence or ability). On and on, in one fascinating example and study after another, Gladwell intrigues with his findings.And you know he's right. You know it ... in your gut. But if the author doesn't make any overall conclusion from all of this fascinating data, then the reader is left to her own wiles. Experience counts more than credentials. What we expose ourselves to on a regular basis molds who we are, how we view others, what choices we make and how we behave. Biases and prejudices are far stronger than our conscious will to overcome them; we must align our environment to align our subconscious. Our deepest self forgets nothing. All we have ever done and been and seen and observed leads to who we are today and tomorrow.All of which gives one pause. But don't pause too long. It is that initial millisecond that may matter most of all."
24,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/159227-carolyn,3,"Equally as fascinating as Gladwell's other book The Tipping Point. Really makes you think, consider your decisions differently. Quotes:But in the end it comes down to a matter of respect, and the simplest way that respect is communicated is through tone of voice.Of the tens of millions of American men below five foot six, a grand total of ten in my sample have reached the level of CEO, which says that being short is probably as much of a handicap to corporate success as being a woman or an African American.Most of us, in ways that we are not entirely aware of, automatically associate leadership ability with imposing physical stature....when corrected for such variables as age and gender and weight, an inch of height is worth $789 a year in salary. That means that a person who is six feet tall but otherwise identical to someone who is five foot five will make on average $5,525 more per year.Prejudging is the kiss of death...because sometimes the most unlikely person is flush.The truth is that improv isn't random and chaotic at all...it's an art form governed by a series of rules, and they want to make sure that when they're up on stage, everyone abides by those rules. One of the most important of the rules that make improv possible, for examples is the idea of agreement, the notion that a very simple way to create a story—or humor—is to have characters accept everything that happens to them. Good improvisors seem telepathic; everything looks pre-arranged. This is because they accept all offers made—which is something no normal person would do.Neither Masten nor Rhea believes that clever packaging allows a company to put out a bad-tasting product. The taste of the product itself matters a great deal. Their point is simply that when we put something in our mouth and in that blink of an eye decide whether it tastes good or not, we are reacting not only to the evidence from our taste buds and salivary glands but also to the evidence of our eyes and memories and imaginations, and it is foolish of company to service one dimension and ignore the other.Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process. Silvan Tomkins one began a lecture by bellowing, ""The face is like a penis!"" What he meant was that the face has, to a large extent, a mind of its own.Imagine if there were a switch that all of us had, to turn off the expressions on our face at will. If babies had that switch, we wouldn't know what they were feeling. They'd be in trouble. You could make an argument, if you wanted to, that the system evolved so that parents would be able to take care of kids.People with autism...have difficulty interpreting non-verbal cues, such as gestures and facial expressions...in anything less than a perfectly literal environment, the autistic person is lost.In the interviews with police officers who have been involved with shootings, these same details appear again and again: extreme visual clarity, tunnel vision, diminished sound, and the sense that time is slowing down. This is how the human body reacts to extreme stress, and it makes sense. Our mind, faced with a life-threatening situation, drastically limits the range and amount of information that we have to deal with. Sound and memory and broader social understanding are sacrificed in favor of heightened awareness of the threat directly in front of us."

We make split-second judgements. Some people more accurately than others. This does not always mean what we think it means.Okay....I guess when the subtitle of a book has the words ""power"" and ""thinking"" in it (""The Power of Thinking Without Thinking""), I expect to gain something from it. Instead I feel like the author explains all the reasons why we should not be relying on snap judgements, despite the fact that some of the time, they are right. I don't find ""some"" to be very useful. If a person can't rely on first impressions, or what the author refers to as ""thin slice"" representations of performance or taste, what good is there in talking about it at all?Then I started thinking about why I read this book in the first place. When the new president of the university where I work started, he talked extensively about Malcolm Gladwell. He referenced this book as well as Outliers. I felt like if I read them, I would understand where he was coming from, and some of the changes he has been making. I have to admit that knowing how much of a decision people make in that first moment could have an impact on how a place is marketed. Even if first impressions don't necessarily become our opinions later on, they still have the power to make a decision in a person's mind, for better or for worse. Still, I'm not sure how you can make that work for you. Is it better to be super-sweet Pepsi that people prefer at the first sip, or more popular Coca-Cola which people are more likely to drink an entire bottle/can of, and make a repeat purchase of? I'd rather be Coke. Can you manufacture enough of a Pepsi experience and then also be Coke? That sounds dangerous to me, because I'm not sure you can be both.""People are ignorant of the things that affect their actions, yet they rarely feel ignorant. We need to accept our ignorance and say 'I don't know' more often.""""How good people's decisions are under the fast-moving, high-stress conditions of rapid cognition is a function of training and rules and rehearsal.""Gladwell does seem to be saying that if you understand the limitations of snap-judgments, you can train yourself to try to lessen bias, prejudice, and incorrect assumptions. It seems to me that the bigger trick is understanding when and how you are doing this to begin with. Write me a book about how to do that, Mr. Gladwell."
26,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/622323-snezan,4,"This work is worth a read, if not more than one. I hesitate to say too much, since I believe the conclusions it reaches are explored in the very beginning and will immediately inform the reader of its relevance. I don't know why that came out so long winded, the reader will find out how interested they are by the first or second chapter.I found the book fascinating for its close look into social interactions, particularly between two people, and for explaining why i sometimes I think the way that I do. The intuitive process of understanding is one that has made a lot of sense to me, and I am glad this book takes a microscope to that underpinning of society's operation. The examples in the book are relevant, timely and buttress the argument well. Especially the story about the psychologist that has a 90 percent success rate of whether a relationship would last past 7 years. The author's decision to skip a little exposition on detractors from the intuitive system of problem solving was a little disappointing, although I do understand that Blink is not, nor pretends to be a scholarly work. Instead it purports to be a lighthouse for a part of our decision-making that is often ignored in society and stays hidden from our conscious understanding. We often don't know why we like or dislike someone the way we do, and yet we allow that judgment to affect our interaction extremely or waffle endlessly over trying to deny or prove our first impression. How many times do you remember saying "" really wanted to like that,"" that being a dress or a person or a book and how much time has it wasted. Or why it sometimes take only a moment for a person to decide whether or not an idea has merit. Gladwell explores those snap judgments in details, and writes in a readable, approachable way. He is not afraid to tackle some controversial topics."

My feelings on this book are quite similar to how I felt about The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (my review) so I'll keep this review short. My first thought after finishing this was: did I really just read 200+ pages on what is essentially the good and bad of gut reactions? There was nothing new for me here and that may not entirely be Gladwell's fault but nevertheless I could not enjoy this book. In addition to my lack of interest in the subject matter, I cannot enjoy the author's writing style. I feel he meanders and that there are so many unfinished thoughts and ideas. It drove me crazy!By the end of the book I was frustrated and upset. I recommend this book to no one. "
28,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15355957-rohit-enghakat,3,"Blink is an interesting read. The book is about making decisions in the blink of an eye, to be precise. The author says that decisions which are made instantly are far more fruitful than those made with long drawn research and logical thinking. He cites many examples which are also interesting to read. For example, the description of the Amadou Diallo incident where police officers shot an unarmed black immigrant in New York with forty-one bullets was stunning. Equally interesting was the last example of Abbie Connant playing the trombone traditionally played by a male in the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra.However, somehow the theory did not appeal to me. It is almost akin to relying on sixth sense, although the author tries to prove this scientifically. The book might appeal more to psychologists or psychiatrists. "

30,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174974-matt-kosinski,2,"Here's Blink in a nutshell:Split decisions can be good; better than decisions where we take a lot of time to carefully weigh our options and use scientific evidence. Except when they're not.Rapid cognition is an exciting and powerful way to use your brain's quick, intuitive capabilities to make stunningly accurate decisions, and can even lead you to have better success in sports, business and politics. Except when it won't.We should learn to trust our snap judgments, even in seemingly complex situations where we don't have a lot of information.Except not really.Basically the book gives scientific and anecdotal evidence on why rapid cognition can be both a good and bad thing, without offering us much advise on how to tell the difference between situations where we should or shouldn't trust our instincts. There are many times when I felt that Gladwell contradicted himself. To support his ""rapid cognition is good"" section of the book, he uses an example of a psychological test where students were able to tell whether or not a professor was good at their job by simply watching a 5 second clip of them lecturing with the sound turned off. The results basically corresponded with impressions given by other students who spent an entire class with those professors - thus proving that there is some mysterious and powerful part of our subconscious that can make accurate snap judgments.But then later on in the book, in the ""rapid cognition is bad"" section, Gladwell warns us that, in general, people instantly like tall, attractive white people better than short, unattractive minorities.WELL DUH! OBVIOUSLY THE STUDENTS RATING THE PROFESSORS WERE BIASED BY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE TALL, WHITE, OR ATTRACTIVE! Mystery solved!While Gladwell brings up some interesting concepts, his book never gels into a coherent whole. I read most of it in under a day and already my rapid cognition is telling me it's not worth finishing."
31,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72368-doc-opp,1,"As an empirical psychologist by training, I get very annoyed at journalists who simplify things to the point that its no longer even remotely accurate. Such is the case for Blink. This is especially annoying to me, because the book describes my area of research specialization. If you're interested in a fun read, Gladwell is certainly an engaging author. If you're looking for something that accurately describes the research, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. For example, Scott Plous's ""the psychology of judgment and decision making"" (which, despite the title, is not textbook like), or the Heath brothers' ""Made to stick"". "

Blink
 is- what all the stories, case studies, and arguments add up to- an attempt to understand the magical and mysterious thing called Judgement. Its basic premise is: split second decisions (snap judgements); how they can be good and bad. Gladwell suggests split-seconds decisions are better than the decisions where we take considerable time to weigh our choices and options. He points out that our mind figure things, people, et al. in a blink of an eye. And it is often that these snap judgements are much more trustworthy than judgements arrived at rationally. But he does not stop here and goes on further: snap judgements can be misleading, too; he termed it Warren Harding error. He suggested that there are some instinctive processes that prevent us to see clearly; and hence cloud our judgements. Blink is an interesting read. It is very well written, and at the same time engages your attention from the start. And writing is reader friendly, perfectly suitable for a layman..................................................I bought this book because I was intrigued by the subtitle of the book: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking. This subtitle was something Zen like, I felt. And when I read it initially, three years ago, I found it resembling with Zen teachings (and koans). Following are two quotes that mainly convey the spirit: ""They were so focused on the mechanics and the process that they never looked at the problem holistically. In the act of tearing something apart, you lose its meaning.""""When making a decision of minor importance its advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital matters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the decision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life , we should be governed by the deep inner needs of our nature."""
33,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/546634-ashley,5,"I would put this book in the category of ""Freakonomics"" and ""The Tipping Point."" By the same author as the latter title, Malcolm Gladwell, the purpose of this book is to weigh the advantages as well as the disadvantages of the power of the mind's ability to unconsciously leap to conclusions based on what is seen in the proverbial blink of an eye. While I have read some negative reviews of Gladwell's book, mostly citing that he fails to inform the reader how to know when to go with your gut and when not to, as well as arguments that he urges readers not to follow their gut when the gut instincts are politically incorrect, I have to disagree with many of them. I think that Gladwell's objective in ""Blink"" is to make the reader simply aware of their gut instincts and to urge them to consider trusting it more frequently than we do. People tend to make decisions that are supported by a litany of rationalizations and explanations, but do we always really have reasons for why we do or think what we do? Gladwell is arguing that we don’t, and that sometimes it takes the unconscious mind to make those decisions for us. On the flip side, he also argues that sometimes we unconsciously make negative decisions based on that same quick judgment and our predetermined stereotypes, such as with people of other sexes or other races than ourselves. “Blink” was a very complicated book with many facets and it’s hard to explain all of them or review them all without writing an essay. In the end, I think the main goal isn’t perfect knowledge of the subject of thinking without thinking, but rather consideration of it and how it can benefit us or hinder us both individually and as a society."
34,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186516-margaret-ross,3,"I think this book wins my prize for Most Easily Misinterpreted to Serve Personal Agendas. Gladwell gets so into the interesting details of the case he's building, he really doesn't emphasize the final conclusions of the book at all, leaving people to think that the interesting details are the whole point, which is unfortunate. But then again, I'm not 100% sure I got the whole point.Most of the folks I know think that this book is about how a person's gut instincts can be a better read of a situation than a read based on thorough study. Which is an idea that most people love, since they don't want to have to do all that boring study anyhow. What's missing from that analysis is that Gladwell later insists (but only at the very end of the book, and almost in passing) that it's the thorough active training and study of a subject that allow a person to have ""true"" or ""correct"" gut reads. The guy who can tell who's getting divorced after 60 seconds of hearing them talk spent years coding verbal and physical cues in couples, studying them intensely for years before he was able to give his 60 second analysis. The art historians were drawing on a vast body of knowledge when they made their judgment about the statue. The cop who read fear instead of aggression and didn't shoot couldn't name what he was seeing, but he'd seen it before. Then he also says that our gut reactions can be easily colored by training we don't even know is there- our prejudices, whether unknown or unacknowledged- influence or reads of a situation as well.Ultimately, I saw this book as a reaction to and analysis of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, with some tips for how to avoid such future tragedies. In that light, I thought it was interesting and even constructive, but only if you pay close attention to the last chapter. "

The book begins with the story of the Getty Kouros (Archaic Greek sculptors reduced human anatomy and musculature in these statues to decorative patterning on the surface of the marble.), which was a statue brought to the J. Paul Getty Museum in California. It was thought by many experts to be legitimate, but when others first looked at it, their initial responses were skeptical.

عنوانهای دیگر که آن بالا نگاشته ام، عنوانهای برگزیده شده ی مترجمین تنها یک کتاب هستند؛ کتابی درباره ی این‌که، چگونه بدون اندیشیدن میاندیشیم، درباره تصمیم‌هایی ست که در یک لحظه گرفته می‌شوند ــ در یک چشم به‌ هم زدن ــ و همه این‌ها به آن سادگی‌ها که به‌ دیده می‌آیند نیستند؛ چرا برخی از افراد، تصمیم‌ گیرهای والایی هستند، در حالی‌که برخی دیگر ناتوانند؟ چرا برخی پیرو غرایزشان هستند، و برنده می‌شوند، در حالی‌که عده‌ ای دیگر، در اشتباه، دست‌ و پا می‌زنند؟ مغز ما واقعا در اداره، در کلاس، در آشپزخانه، و در خانه، چگونه کار می‌کند؟ و چرا اغلب بهترین تصمیمات، آن‌هایی هستند که توضیحشان برای دیگران، ناممکن است؟ در کتاب «یک نگاه» با روان‌شناسی آشنا می‌شویم، که می‌داند چطور با مشاهده ی چند دقیقه‌ ای صحبت زوج‌ها، طول زندگی زناشویی آن‌ها را، پیش‌بینی کند؛ مربی تنیسی، که می‌داند پیش از اصابت راکت با توپ، آیا بازیکن خطا می‌کند یا خیر؛ متخصصان عتیقه‌ شناسی، که با یک نگاه، اصل یا تقلبی بودن شی‌ء را، تشخیص می‌دهند؛ هم‌چنین شکست‌های بزرگ قضاوت در یک نگاه نیز در این کتاب شرح داده می‌شوند: انتخاب «وارن هاردینگ»؛ تولید کوکای جدید؛ و کشتن «دیالو» توسط پلیس؛ «یک نگاه» فاش می‌کند، که تصمیم‌ گیرنده‌ های بزرگ، آن‌هایی نیستند که بیشترین اطلاعات را فرآوری می‌کنند، یا بیشترین زمان را صرف اندیشیدن می‌کنند، بلکه کسانی هستند که هنر تمام عیار «برش نازک» را دارند، یعنی از بین انواع وسژگیهای مربوط به یک مسئله، اصلی‌ترین آن‌ها را جدا می‌کنندنقل نمونه متن: «پیش درآمد: مجسمه ای که اصل نبود؛ در سپتامبر 1983میلادی، یک دلال آثار هنری به نام جیان فرانکو به چینا به موزه پاول گتی کالیفرنیا مراجعه کرد؛ او ادعا میکرد مجسمه مرمرینی در اختیار دارد که متعلق به شش قرن پیش از میلاد است؛ این مجسمه معروف به کورس بود ـ مجسمه ای از یک مرد جوان برهنه ایستاده با دستانی از دوطرف آویخته و پای چپ جلو نهاده؛ تا آن زمان در حدود دویست مجسمه کورسی از حفاریهای باستانشناسی یا گورهای قدیمی به دست آمده بود که اغلب آنها در هنگام اکتشاف یا متلاشی شده بودند و یا بدجوری آسیب دیده بودند، اما این یکی تقریبا سالم مانده بود؛ ارتفاع این مجسمه نزدیک به دومتر و بیست و پنج سانتیمتر بود و شفافیتی داشت که آن را از بقیه مجسمه های اکتشافی متمایز میکرد؛ این یک کشف خارق العاده بود و مبلغ پیشنهادی به چینا زیر ده میلیون دلار بود؛ موزه گتی با احتیاط وارد عمل شد؛ مجسمه کورس را به امانت گرفت و تحقیق دقیقی را شروع کرد؛ آیا مجسمه با بقیه مجسمه های کورسی همخوانی داشت؟ جواب به ظاهر آری بود؛ شیوه ی ساخت آن به نظر مشابه مجسمه کورس آناویسوس در موزه ملی باستان شناسی آتن بود، و معنایش این بود که با زمان و مکان خاصی مطابقت داشت؛ این مجسمه از کجا و چه زمانی پیدا شده بود؟ هیچکس به طور دقیق نمیدانست؛ اما به چینا مدارکی به اداره حقوقی موزه گتی ارائه داد که حاوی تاریخچه اخیر آن بود؛ طبق مدارک موجود، کورس از سال 1930میلادی در کلکسیون خصوصی یک پزشک سوییسی به نام لوفن برگر نگهداری میشد، که خود او نیز آن را از دلال معروف آثار هنری یونانی به نام روسس خریده بود؛ برای بررسیهای دقیق، زمین شناسی به نام استنلی مارگولیس از دانشگاه کالیفرنیا به موزه آمد و به مدت دو روز سطح مجسمه را با یک استریو میکروسکوپ بسیار حساس مورد آزمایش قرار داد و بعد از زیر زانوی راست مجسمه تکه ای به قطر یک سانتیمتر و طول دو سانتیمتر جدا کرد و با استفاده از میکروسکوپ الکترونی، اشعه انکساری ایکس و اشعه فلورسنسی ایکس به تجزیه آن پرداختمارگولیس به این نتیجه رسید که مجسمه از سنگ مرمر دُلومیت معدن قدیمی کیپ وتی در جزیره تاسوس ساخته شده، و سطح مجسمه با لایه نازکی از کربنات آهک پوشیده شده است ــ که به گفته وی از اهمیت خاصی برخوردار بود ــ زیرا دُلومیت تنها در طول قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند تبدیل به کربنات آهک شود؛ به عبارت دیگر مجسمه شیئی قدیمی بود و تقلبی نبودموزه گتی از این مسئله خشنود بود، و چهارده ماه پس از شروع تحقیقات با خریدن مجسمه موافقت شد؛ در پاییز 1986میلادی مجسمه برای اولین بار به نمایش گذاشته شد؛ نیویورک تایمز حکایت آنرا در صفحه ی اول خود آورد؛ چند ماه بعد متصدی اموال عتیقه ی موزه، ماریون ترو، گزارشی پرشور و بلندبالا از دستیابی موزه به مجسمه، برای مجله برلینگتون نوشت: «اکنون کورس با قامتی برافراشته و دستانی مشت شده حیات مطمئن خویش را که برترین خصلت او و برادرانش است ابراز میکند.» و سپس پیروزمندانه نتیجه گیری کرد: «او چه خدا باشد و چه انسان تجسم کامل نیروی تابناک بلوغ هنری غرب است.»؛ با تمام این احوال مشکلی وجود داشت؛ مجسمه به نظر اصل نمیآمد، اولین کسیکه به این مشکل اشاره کرد، فردی بود به نام فدریکو زِری، مورخ هنرشناس ایتالیایی، که عضو هیئت امنای موزه نیز بود؛ وقتی «زِری» در دسامبر 1983میلادی به محل نگهداری مجسمه رفت، تا آن را ببیند، بی اختیار به ناخنهای آن خیره شد؛ البته نمیخواست توضیحی برای این مسئله بدهد، اما به نظرش یک جای کار ایراد داشت؛ نفر بعدی «اِوِلین هریسون»، یکی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی بود، که هنگام معامله نهایی، در «لس آنجلس» بود؛ او چنین به خاطر میآورد: آن زمان آرتور هافتن متصدی موزه بود، و ما را برای بازدید برد؛ او با یک حرکت پارچه روی مجسمه را پس زد و گفت، «خُب، این هنوز مال ما نیست اما تا چند هفته دیگر خواهد شد.»؛ و من گفتم: «خیلی متاسفم که این را میشنوم.»، هریسون چه دیده بود؟ خودش نمیداند؛ در همان لحظه اول، وقتی «هافتن» پارچه را کنار زده بود، آنچه «هریسون» حس کرده بود، یک الهام بود، یک احساس غریزی از اینکه چیزی آن وسط اشکال داشت؛چند ماه بعد «هافتن»، «تامس هاوینگ» مدیر سابق موزه «متروپولتین» را برای بازدید از مجسمه، به کارگاه مرمّت موزه برد؛ «هاوینگ» همیشه اولین کلمه ای را که با دیدن چیزی از ذهنش میگذرد یادداشت میکند؛ و هرگز فراموش نمیکند اولین کلمه ای که با دیدن «کورس» از ذهنش گذشت چه بود؛هاوینگ میگوید: «آن کلمه «تازه» بود ــ «تازه»، و «تازه» برای مجسمه ای که دوهزار سال قدمت دارد کلمه مناسبی نیست.»؛ «هاوینگ» بعدها که راجع به آن لحظه فکر کرد، فهمید چرا چنین کلمه ای به ذهنش خطور کرده بود: «من در سیسیلی حفاری کرده بودم، جاییکه تکه ها و قطعاتی از این دست پیدا میشوند، اما این یکی به هیچ کدام شبیه نبود؛ به نظر میرسید این مجسمه کورس از توی یکی از همین قوطیهای قهوه مرغوب استارباکس بیرون آمده باشد!» «هاوینگ» رو به «هافتن» پرسید، «آیا برای آن پولی هم پرداخته اید؟» و وقتی با چهره متعجب هافتن مواجه شد، گفت، «اگر پرداخته اید سعی کنید پس بگیرید و معامله را فسخ کنید.»؛ مسئولان موزه «گتی» کم کم داشتند نگران میشدند، بنابراین سمپوزیوم ویژه ای در مورد کورس در یونان برپا کردند؛ مجسمه را بسته بندی کردند و به یونان فرستادند، و از متخصصان ارشد مجسمه شناسی دعوت کردند؛ اینبار زمزمه یاس و دلهره بلندتر به گوش میرسید؛ «هریسون» در کنار مردی ایستاده بود که نامش «جرج دِس پینیس» بود، و رئیس موزه «آرکوپولیس آتن»؛ «جرج دس پینیس» نگاهی به کورس انداخت و رنگش پرید؛ او رو به هریسون گفت: «هر کس یکبار در عمرش مجسمه ای را که از دل خاک بیرون کشیده شده، دیده باشد میتواند تشخیص دهد، این یکی زیرزمین نبوده است.» «جورجیوس دانتاس»، رئیس جمعیت باستانشناسی آتن، به محض اینکه مجسمه را دید تنش یخ کرد؛ او گفت: «وقتی برای اولین بار کورس را دیدم احساس کردم انگار شیشه ای بین من و مجسمه کشیده شده است.»؛در سمپوزیوم، «آنجلوس دِلی وریاس» مدیر موزه «بناکی آتن» نیز گفته های «دانتاس» را تایید کرد؛ او به تفصیل از تناقض بین سبک ساخت مجسمه، و این واقعیت که مرمر آن از معادن تاسوس استخراج شده است، صحبت کرد، و سپس به اصل مطلب رسید؛ چرا او فکر میکرد که مجسمه تقلبی است؟ زیرا وقتی برای اولین بار به آن نگاه انداخته بود موجی از ادراک و دافعه ی حسی در او برانگیخته شده بود؛ زمانیکه سمپوزیوم به پایان رسید در بین اکثر مدعوین این اتفاق نظر وجود داشت، که کورس ابدا آن چیزی نیست که تصور میشدموزه گتی با تمامی متخصصان و وکلای خود و ماهها بررسی دقیق به یک نتیجه رسیده بود، و برخی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی ــ تنها با یک نگاه و احساس دافعه حسی ــ به نتیجه ای دیگر؛ حق با کدام یک بود؟ برای مدتی هیچ چیز مشخص نبود؛ کورس تبدیل به مسئله ای شده بود که متخصصان هنری در کنفرانسهای مختلف بر سر آن بحث و جدل میکردند؛ اما بعد، اندک اندک، ابهامات ماجرای گتی شروع به روشن شدن نمود؛ برای مثال نامه هایی که وکلای گتی به دقت پیگیری کرده بودند و مشخص میکرد که کورس متعلق به یک پزشک سوییسی بوده، جعلی از آب درآمد؛ یکی از نامه هایی که به تاریخ 1952میلادی بود دارای یک کدپستی بود، که تا بیست سال پس از آن تاریخ هنوز وجود خارجی نداشت؛ نامه دیگری که تاریخ 1955میلادی را داشت، به یک حساب بانکی اشاره داشت، که تا تاریخ 1963میلادی هنوز افتتاح نشده بود؛ در اصل نتیجه ی ماهها تحقیق فقط این شد که کورس موزه گتی همان سبک مجسمه آناویسوس را داشت، اما این نتیجه گیری نیز مورد شک بود؛هرچه متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی دقیقتر به آن نگاه میکردند بیشتر به التقاطی بودن آن پی میبردند؛ هر قسمت از اندام مجسمه مربوط به زمان و مکان متفاوتی بود؛ اندام باریک مرد جوان بیشتر شبیه کورس تنه آ بود که در موزه مونیخ نگهداری میشد، و موهای خوش حالتش شبیه کورس موزه متروپولتین نیویورک؛ و در این بین پاهایش چیزی نبودند جز هنر مدرن، از قضا این مجسمه از همه بیشتر شبیه مجسمه شکسته و کوچکتری بود که در سال 1990میلادی، توسط یک هنرشناس بریتانیایی در سوییس پیدا شده بود؛ هر دو مجسمه از یک سنگ مرمر مشابه و با یک سبک تراشیده شده بود؛ اما کورس سوییسی متعلق به گذشته نبود، بلکه در اوایل دهه هشتاد در کارگاهی در رم ساخته شده بود؛ پس تحقیقات علمی که مشخص میکرد سطح مجسمه کورس تنها پس از قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند به چنین شکلی درآید چه؟ خوب آن نتایج همچندان قطعی نبودند؛ طبق آزمایشها و بررسیهای بعدی زمینشناس دیگری به این نتیجه رسید، که با استفاده از کپک سیب زمینی، میتوان در عرض چند ماه سطح مجسمه مرمر دلومیتی را به شکل کهنه و قدیمی درآورد؛ در کاتالوگ موزه گتی تصویری از مجسمه کورس چاپ شده که زیر آن نوشته شده «حدود ۵۳۰سال قبل از میلاد، یا، مدرن جعلی.»؛ زمانیکه «فدریکو زری» و «اِوِلین هریسون» و «تامس هاوینگ» و «جورجیوس دانتاس» ــ و خیلیهای دیگر ــ با یک نگاه به مجسمه دچار دافعه حسی شدند مطمئنا حق داشتند؛ آنها در همان دو ثانیه اول ـ در یک نگاه ـ به شناختی از ماهیت مجسمه دست یافتند که تیم تخصصی موزه گتی پس از چهارده ماه تحقیق هنوز به آن نرسیده بود؛ یک نگاه کتابی است درباره ی همان دو ثانیه نخست.»؛ پایان نقلا. شربیانی"
36,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"O, to have the writing career of Malcolm Gladwell. The man pulls interesting case studies from academic research and news headlines, spins it into a book under a general theme, and blammo! He has a bestseller. This formula worked for him with The Tipping Point and then Blink. Blink is a compelling read, despite its weak overall theme, which is that sometimes split-second decisions are good and sometimes they're bad, and we need to learn when to trust our first impressions and when to discount them (except there's no real way to make that distinction). The book is a pleasure to read simply because of its case studies. Gladwell throws in so many topics — art, politics, marriage, consumer testing, athletes, war, police shootings, music — that there is bound to be something engaging for everyone. (After reading another one of Gladwell's peppy articles in The New Yorker, my husband joked, ""Gladwell thinks he can make ANYTHING seem interesting."")After finishing Blink, I feel like I've learned something important, but I'm not sure exactly what, other than that Gladwell has a very charmed career.My rating: 3.5 stars rounded up to 4"
37,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,3,"This was a big best-seller for Gladwell. He posits that much of the time we make decisions, reach conclusions in a sort of pre-conscious manner that he calls “thin-slicing.” That means taking a very small sample, a thin slice, and making a decision immediately based on that information. However, it is the case that the ability to evaluate that slice is fed by a lifetime of experience. It is not simply, as some, including President Bush the second, might believe, that using one’s gut, in the absence of years and years of preparation, is as valid a way of reaching decisions as taking the longer route of careful analysis of available data. No, no, no."
38,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"I generally distrust anyone who says that they ‘go-with-their-gut’. But when the company I work for announced a major decision a few years back, I instantly said, “This is going to be a huge mistake.” Smart people had examined the deal backwards and forwards for months and thought it was a great idea. I had a bad feeling about it that I could only later explain, and I was far from the only one. And we were right. The entire thing turned out to be a huge disaster. I kept thinking about that incident when I read Blink. The book has a pretty obvious point. People make snap decisions that they can’t consciously explain. Sometimes these decisions are correct and amazing based on the limited amount of information available. Art experts who instantly know a statue is fake despite scientific tests indicating otherwise. A fireman who appears to be fighting a routine small fire suddenly orders his men out without really knowing why and the floor collapses a second later. And sometimes these decisions can be wrong and have tragic consequences. Four cops think a guy has a gun when he’s pulling his wallet out and shoot him multiple times.We’ve all made quick decisions and later been amazed at how good or bad they turned out, but what makes Blink interesting is that Gladwell does some examination of the science behind how we arrive at these conclusions, and his thoughts on how the data we’re processing can either give us incredible insight or lead us horribly wrong.Thankfully, Gladwell is not making an argument against logical thinking or analyzing a problem. What he is doing is pointing out that instinct or intuition can be a powerful tool IF the people involved have trained themselves to make good decisions, and if we know when to trust it. He’s got a lot of great examples of doctors, military officers and police officers who often have to make life-or-death decisions in a matter of seconds with limited information. They have to trust their instincts, and Gladwell makes some common sense points that the right kind of training and education can make a huge difference. He contrasts the story of the four New York cops who killed the guy with a wallet versus a patrolman who did not fire on someone who actually had a gun but was attempting to surrender it.What made this book fun to read was the variety of examples that Gladwell uses and the scientific research done with them. Art dealers, doctors, marriage counselors, cops, military officers, car salesmen, a tennis coach, and classical musicians are all used as examples of the strengths and weaknesses of snap decisions. There’s also some simple experiments included that let you play along at home. This is a book that will make you think about the way you think."

40,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak,4,"Much like the reason behind my majoring in Economics, I like Gladwell because he opens my mind to new ideas and new ways to think. Much like Economics, I believe he's far from perfect, but I really enjoy viewing the world through his lens. In just about anything, when people start acting as if there is only one way to do something, I stop listening to them. This goes for many things, but especially politics. If you DO, however, find someone who is omniscient and knows exactly how every policy will turn out in the end, please let me know. I may listen to their one way of seeing the world. Otherwise ...What I got from Blink is that there is a lot to our instant thoughts and feelings and many times much more than we give them credit. The traditional wisdom is to plan and make huge weighty decisions based on every single bit of information that we have at our fingertips (which is just about everything, google!). This is actually a big reason my wife and I get into ... disagreements (we'll go with that). She likes to plan everything down to the last detail and I like to be a bit more relaxed.So it would seem that this book is a big proponent of my way of doing things, but it turns out it's not so much.We should trust our gut-instinct, says Blink, if we have many hours of experience in said realm of understanding because we have developed the skills to make sense of those small details and because we have the ability to ""thin slice."" Gladwell also makes the point that not always can we trust our gut-intinct, however, because our gut-instinct tends to be racist, even when we are not in fact consciously racist. Also, our instincts can get overwhelmed by heightened arousal, such as when people can't even dial 911 in an emergency because their senses are overloaded.But then again, you can practice and have these types of unconscious reactions mitigated.The interesting story-telling style of introducing these topics is, of course, what really gets me. It's the stories that are often unbelievable that have me clamoring for more, just like in Outliers (although I think Outliers was a little better written) and I would assume his other books. He goes into why The Getty art museum spent millions on a fake kouros (Greek statue) and why cops probably aren't racial profiling when they beat people like Rodney King, but because of a few key mistakes such as allowing their unconscious to get overwhelmed and also because they were a group of officers instead of just one.He talks about people who can listen to a couple and tell when they should start talking to their lawyers and people who have developed the actual abilities that are shown in the TV show ""Lie to Me."" How looking at a person's room for 5 minutes may give a complete stranger a better picture of a person than a good friend. I've always loved these types of explanations for things. There's the old wisdom we have and the wisdom we assume when we don't have any other way to describe a particular event and which is completely wrong. I love thinking new ideas, even when it's old news and that's why I'll keep coming back to Gladwell."
41,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"Elsewhere, in one of my other recent reviews, a GoodReads friend (Richard) told me that he had become less infatuated with this book after reading a review by a specialist in the field who gave it a drubbing. I was worried that knowing this might ruin this book for me – but it has not. I really enjoyed this one too. This is the third of Gladwell’s books I’ve read in quick succession and this contained lots of information about things that have made me think and sparked my interest to learn more. It may well be that Gladwell’s style does not appeal to an expert in the field – and that is quite likely to be true, but I’ve found that it is often the case that I’ve been introduced to themes by popularisers and later went on to read more deeply on a subject. I rarely condemn those who introduce me to fascinating topics – and this is a fascinating topic.I’m not going to do a full review, but rather quickly talk about wine. While he was talking about coke and about taste tests I was thinking about wine. He makes the point that when asked to judge jam people do nearly as well as the experts if they are just asked which jam they liked the most, but do much worse than experts if asked to explain why they graded them in the order that they did. That is, if they have to talk about texture and sweetness and citrus flavours – people change how they judge jam and end up picking the worst jam rather than the best. This is because we don’t really know what ‘texture’ is and so trying to slot jams into categories that we don’t really understand means we are most likely to stuff up and confuse ourselves. Now, wine. I wonder if anyone has ever done a test at cellar doors to see what people end up buying and if they pick the nicest wine for the price, or do they buy vinegar instead? I wouldn’t mind betting that there would be something similar happening here – and if you are with someone who says things like, “Oh yes, fruity, but with a back-taste of coal tar” you might end up buying something that is quite disgusting. You know, unless you actually have some idea of what you are talking about, it might be best to shut up and drink the wine.That is the point of this book – learning when to trust your “immediate reactions” and when to question them. I think there is much in this book that is worth knowing and much that is fascinatingly interesting. (The stuff about unconscious racism is so important that everyone should be forced to read this for that alone). But with Richard, I am a little concerned that an expert in the field didn't like this book. All the same, the expert does recommend Made to Stick so I guess that can be the next book I read.There is – as is proven by Dylan Moran – only one way to pick wine:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2gGf..."
42,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,4,"I reread this after realizing I couldn't remember enough to compare with Kahneman`s book. They are mostly aligning, only Kahneman suggests against making snap judgements and relying more on evidence whereas Gladwell gives views from both sides and stays impartial.Blink is about unconscious decision making. Our unconscious side is fascinating, because it seems to be the one that holds the strings most of the time; making very fast decisions, watching out for any threat to our existence. However when our drives (the motivators of unconscious) are in conflict, ourrational mind is quick to get in. The rational mind is also there to make corrections, and making plans. So it seems that mostly we are on autopilot for unimportant things, and also when we have to do something at lightening speed. But at other times even if there is an urge to act instinctively, one should act relying on data rather than on instinct."
43,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,"Probably the best among Gladwell's books. He still stands true to his success mantra - ""Gladwell - The Power of Inductive Reasoning."" But, it was still a well researched and informative book. Blink."

While I enjoyed The Tipping Point more, I have to say that I am happy to have read this after that particular chapter. This is not to say it's the only one I found interesting, because at least one other one was quite fascinating for me.I do plan to read more books by Gladwell in the future."
45,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1090620-ed,2,"I didn't learn much from this book that I did not already know. I am beginning to suspect that Malcolm Gladwell is not writing books that uncover valuable facts that we should know, but rather is writing books that restate facts we already know but in an interesting way.I like his anecdotal stories very much which is why I finished the book - hoping for more stories. When he lays out the facts, though, his writing is no more interesting than any other scientific author. So, in summary, what we have is a talented writer making certain scientific findings available to a much wider audience than usual. Bravo! However if you want to learn something new, this book or his previous effort, The Tipping Point, is not where to go to find it. I imagine, if I read it, I will find The Outliers, his latest effort, to be similarly constructed.Blink's content is easily summarized. First impressions are often more accurate than conclusions arrived at after much study and analysis. Be careful, though, because first impressions can be troublesome because of people's prejudices. Got it in 254 pages. He does come up with an interesting term, ""thin slicing"", to describe the process of taking in a first impression. Maybe learning that term made reading the whole book worthwhile. Maybe."
46,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"A really great study on how important the first few seconds of anything can be, in any particular situation. Be it that you're an art expert who instantly knows an object is fake, or a police man who thinks that the victim is pulling a gun out of their pocket rather than a wallet, it's very clear that human beings do have this constant auto-pilot running, an unconscious ""survival mode"" that gives us most of the clues we might need in the ""blink"" of an eye, and sometimes those clues might be wrong."
47,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"Gladwell continues his exploration of counter-intuitive ideas about decision-making in BLINK! He opens with a 1983 incident at the J. Paul Getty Museum. The Museum acquired a rare statue from the Greek archaic period. To this day, the Museum maintains that the authenticity of the statue is uncertain. At the time, however, the Museum was certain enough to acquire the piece for just under $10 million. Documentation, and scientific analysis had been relied on as support. However, numerous experts including Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas Hoving pronounced it a fake. It was an intuitive pronouncement which presaged problems later uncovered with both the documentation and scientific analysis. This is the first of many stories Gladwell uses to illustrate how an intuitive reaction can trump logic and analysis.Among the factors that cloud logic is something he calls the adaptive unconscious. It's an unrecognized emotional bias. In the Getty example, the officials wanted the piece to be authentic. It would have been a spectacular acquisition for a newly established museum. This desire diverted critical scrutiny of the supporting evidence. Such an adaptation need not even be emotion based. In an explanation of priming, Gladwell cites psychological studies that illustrate the subconscious effect of pre-conditioning through word lists. Extrapolating from these examples, one might conclude that the casual reader will be highly influenced when reviewing a book by his mood or even surroundings at the time of reading.Gladwell explores other impediments to logical thinking, logic being a type of perceptual filter. Face recognition, he points out, occurs in a completely different part of the brain, and is an integrated reaction as opposed to the kind of multi-step processing that occurs in dealing with language. Athletic and musical achievement rely on these non-verbal neural processes. His own example cites Paul Van Ripper's success against a team backed by the Pentagon's most sophisticated computers in a war games exercise. The Pentagon team was actually hampered in their decision making by information overload. Initial reaction, Gladwell points out is not always accurate. He tries to explore this downside as well by citing studies on bias. Gladwell is an entertaining storyteller as well as an energetic researcher. He draws examples from market research, Chancellorsville in the Civil War, the assessment of heart attacks at Cook County Hospital, speed dating, fire fighting, the auditioning of professional musicians, and the Diallo Incident in the Bronx to illustrate his points. By drawing from such a wide variety of experience, he insures the interest of a broad audience in this book. NOTE: It's always fun to re-encounter characters from other books. I knew of Thomas Hoving from his book, KING OF THE CONFESSORS. The idea of thin-slice thinking was also explored in HOW WE DECIDE, by Jonah Lehrer. The deconstruction of flavor is discussed from a neurophysiological standpoint in Gordon Shepherd's NEUROGASTRONOMY. "

49,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,2,"I was really expecting more from this book. I've heard mostly good things about Gladwell, and he had a pretty interesting TED talk, and I enjoy almost anything to do with the brain, so...why not?The book certainly brought up a lot of interesting ideas and did a good job of discussing the different elements that go into the snap decisions that we make every day. And it's probably worth a read for many of the stories and experiments related. But for the most part this book really failed to impress. More than that though, it failed at being a coherent analysis of what goes on in the human brain when we make snap judgments. Gladwell alternates between telling us to trust and accept this ""mysterious phenomena"" that allows us to make these unconscious snap judgments and warning us against the use of these snap judgments. One moment he advises against the idea that we need to slowly collect data and weigh options to make the most informed opinion and provides examples where too much thinking and information leads us astray, and in the next moment gives us examples of how snap judgments sometimes go horribly wrong. And he leaves us with no clear sense of how to use this new found information to make better decisions and judgments in our own lives. Do I trust my insights because my rational brain will fool me, or do I mistrust my instincts because of the inherent bias contained within them? If Gladwell knows he sure didn't tell me.One example of somewhere where I think he didn't analyze the situation enough was when he talked about the Wisconsin Card Sorting task (pick cards from one of two decks, one deck tends towards bad and the other towards good outcomes). He focused solely on how the unconscious mind was aware of the pattern (which deck was bad and which was good) long before the conscious mind was aware of it when making decisions. And this was shown by the fact that sweating occurred when choosing from the ""bad"" deck before the subject knew why (or was even aware of it). What he fails to mention about all this is that the reason for this is because we are designed to be ""risk averse"". It is not because we are making brilliant snap judgments, or that our brains have ""learned"" the rules before we are aware of it. From an evolutionary perspective it pays off more to learn from our mistakes than learn from our victories. Mistakes are costly. This is why bad memories are more salient than happy ones. The sweating that occurs is a physiological indicator of and means of prompting the organism to stay away. It's not even that this explanation is in contradiction to Gladwell's; it is that it IS an explanation for the phenomena Gladwell describes, one easily at Gladwells' disposal. Two other aspects of this book stuck out as major frustrations for me:1) Gladwell spends a lot of time early on talking about the mysterious nature of our ability to thin slice (make accurate snap judgments based on very little information) and urges us to accept this. To his credit, he does attempt to demystify this somewhat later on, but not enough in my opinion. His first example is of a museum that purchased an expensive sculpture which all the data and scientists evaluated as legitimate, but which experts in the field immediately saw as a fake without being able to put into words why. It's purposefully misleading to label this as some sort of mysterious phenomena. For instance, it's important to remember that these people were experts. An amateur would not and could not make this same snap judgment because they don't have the training to. This ability didn't magically appear, it came from learning and training and synaptic change. These experts learned over time. They studied types of stone, and different styles, and everything else that goes into understanding their field. And this process created memories...synaptic change within their brains. And there exists a system (or systems) in the brain that can make decisions based on that neuronal structure without conscious awareness. Shortcuts so to speak. But these shortcuts are a product of that neuronal structure, which is a product of that synaptic change, which is a product of the learning the individual did over time. It's misleading to call this mysterious. What's important, and more interesting in my opinion, is figuring out the underlying processes that allow this to happen. 2) Towards the end of the book Gladwell discusses how our stress response leads us to make all sorts of bad decisions. He talks about autism and how autistic people can't mind read (don't have theories of other minds) and how this affects their interpretation of events around them and of the world in general. He compares what happens to people in stressful situations to this, that during these situations, because the fight or flight response has taken over, people have tunnel vision and can no longer ""read minds"" and thus make all sorts of mistakes and bad decisions because they are focusing on the wrong things. My issue is that he, incomprehensibly, makes a literal, as opposed to metaphorical, connection with autism. He argues that during these times we become ""temporarily autistic"". While it's true that one aspect of our behavior becomes similar to an aspect of an autistic individuals behavior during these times, it seems like a pretty ridiculous statement to make as a broad generalization. He spends quite a bit of time talking about this and I don't think it does anyone any good.In the end I think I was most disappointed by the fact that all the elements to create a good book WERE present here, and the failure is due in large part to how he puts it all together and his ability to analyze all the disparate ideas properly (insert irony here). Evolution has built into us shortcuts to react quickly to stimuli in our environment. Our experience, whether broadly cultural or personal, prunes, enhances, changes those built in shortcuts as we go through life. Some develop as unfair biases towards people of different races. Some develop as we become experts in a subject. Thus some can be trusted and some can't. Our brains can't tell the difference between fact and fiction, only between experience and non experience, and so it's important to be aware of what kind of decision making goes on under the surface and what factors are involved in those decisions so we can be more aware of whether to trust them or not. Other factors can affect decision making, such as our emotional state due to the physiological changes that take place during those times, and this too is important to understand because it radically alters our perception during those times. The most important thing to remember is that experience translates into instinct through synaptic change, and through work and training we can increase the effectiveness of our gut reactions and snap decisions, but due to biases and our altered states during emotional situations those instincts should not always be trusted outright. There you go Malcolm Gladwell, please feel free to use this in the next printing. No citation necessary. "
50,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Malcolm Gladwell engagingly writes about how decisions made in a blink--snap judgments--can be very good. A series of entertaining anecdotes and psychological studies show that first impressions can be good in some cases, especially in areas where people have experience. He also writes about experts who analyze facial expressions, and how autistic people have trouble making certain types of judgment calls.But then he goes on to show how our unconscious mind can also be very prejudiced. Tall men are more likely to become CEOs than short men. Using Warren Harding as an example, he shows that people may vote for a political candidate because they look presidential. Women are less likely to be offered positions in some orchestras unless the auditions are held with the competitors behind a screen, so they are just evaluated on their playing ability. He also includes stories about police officers making snap judgments, and the judicial system handing out longer sentences to minorities. There were some examples that supported decisions made quickly by the subconscious level, and other examples that showed certain decisions were better when we slowed down and consciously gave things a little more thought. Experience played a big part in having good judgment making quick decisions. Gladwell does not get into how the brain works in making decisions. The book is interesting and entertaining, but it raises as many questions as it answers. 3.5 stars."

Even as a general reader, I find this book says a lot of things but does not actually tell you what it actually wants to address. But I love this book for totally different reasons. Firstly, I love case studies with interesting results written by someone who can write in a way you will find the whole experience exhilarating. Secondly, this guy deserves a five star because he is making less known but thought-provoking scientific studies to a much wider audience. Thirdly, nowhere it is mentioned in the title it is a book which teaches you how to think without thinking so it is completely understandable why it shows us both the advantages and disadvantages of snap decision making and it completely leaves to the reader to decide when to do what. Finally, I love non-fiction which uses a lot of anecdotes to state a fact rather just directly stating the fact it wants to address. I recommend it to anyone who loves to read about interesting psychological studies. "

53,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/337591-zinta,5,"Where does it all go, after you are done experiencing the experience, thinking the thought, feeling the feeling? Nothing is ever lost. The subconscious is like a vast warehouse, limitless, in fact, and as Malcolm Gladwell illustrates in Blink, we access all that is stored in that warehouse with every blinking and waking moment.Usually, we call this instant access - gut instinct. Or, the inner voice of wisdom. Instinct, however, is nothing magical or mysterious. It is simply our accumulated and stored knowledge over a lifetime. If there was ever an argument for listening to those who have some serious and well-lived years under their belts, this is it. Blink illustrates with numerous and widely varied examples how life experience, the more the better, contributes to our ability to make quick, yet sound decisions. In fact, the quicker, the better.Blink is about what the author calls ""thin slicing."" He defines this process as the moment of time in which we all make snap judgments. Two seconds, two minutes ... and we make an assessment of a situation or a person or a circumstance. The fascinating thing is - these snap judgments are, more often than not, precise ones. It is when we begin to over analyze and rationalize that we tend to go awry. The trick is to allow the accumulated wisdom rise up and do its magic, trust in it.Then again ...Gladwell never does make a concluding statement in his book, and perhaps it is up to the reader to decide (do it quickly?), but his many fascinating examples and his reports on various studies can lead one to think these snap judgments are the way to go - or, then again, thinker beware. For all the many situations in which that moment of initial wisdom is uncannily precise, there are other times that our deeply ingrained biases muck up the clarity of that process. Gladwell cites data to illustrate how stereotypes, for instance, persist - no matter how gallant our conscious efforts to overcome them. Telling yourself you don't really think what you think simply won't work. Only exposure to experiences, or positive visualizations, will change the false ideas and images our subconscious has absorbed over time. All of which is a strong argument for ""garbage in, garbage out."" That is, be careful of what entertainment you choose (e.g. pornographic images, violent movies or games, etc.), because no matter how hard your conscious mind tries to guide you toward decisions and behavior that is more appropriate, your subconscious will always, but always win out.The idea of what you present to your eye is what you will later project out to the world is a convincing one, as the author finds himself unable to beat the test on stereotypes when he has to react quickly. Only exposure to more positive images over time can change his test results and dislodge his prejudices.Gladwell discusses this phenomena of instant response-true response in a manner of ways. How patients respond to their doctors (we sue the physician who has a lousy bedside manner, even if more skilled, but remain loyal to the physician who spends as little as three extra minutes talking with us); how facial expressions, when viewed on slowed down video, will without fail, always reveal deceit (there are facial movements that arise from our subconscious that we cannot control, and no matter how quickly we think we have our facial mask in place, there is always that instant that our faces tell the truth); the intricacies of marketing and advertisement and why the obvious ad, even when based on feedback of focus groups, may not be the effective choice; how military decisions by experienced military leaders are successful, but fail miserably when they are constrained by strategic analysis; how micro-managing in workplaces can only lead to mediocrity while suppressing creativity and innovation; how speed dating may be most effective in finding potential lifelong connections (we read about research that can pick out successful, longterm relationships in observing as little as two minutes of interaction between a couple - and no, it isn't the couple that argues that breaks apart); how our societal subconscious biases for certain physical characteristics, such as height or gender, often mislead us to make dangerously faulty snap judgments (Gladwell observes that most of our leaders are tall and male, and that our corporate world pays tall men higher salaries, factoring dollars down to the inch, regardless of intelligence or ability). On and on, in one fascinating example and study after another, Gladwell intrigues with his findings.And you know he's right. You know it ... in your gut. But if the author doesn't make any overall conclusion from all of this fascinating data, then the reader is left to her own wiles. Experience counts more than credentials. What we expose ourselves to on a regular basis molds who we are, how we view others, what choices we make and how we behave. Biases and prejudices are far stronger than our conscious will to overcome them; we must align our environment to align our subconscious. Our deepest self forgets nothing. All we have ever done and been and seen and observed leads to who we are today and tomorrow.All of which gives one pause. But don't pause too long. It is that initial millisecond that may matter most of all."

Quotes:But in the end it comes down to a matter of respect, and the simplest way that respect is communicated is through tone of voice.Of the tens of millions of American men below five foot six, a grand total of ten in my sample have reached the level of CEO, which says that being short is probably as much of a handicap to corporate success as being a woman or an African American.Most of us, in ways that we are not entirely aware of, automatically associate leadership ability with imposing physical stature....when corrected for such variables as age and gender and weight, an inch of height is worth $789 a year in salary. That means that a person who is six feet tall but otherwise identical to someone who is five foot five will make on average $5,525 more per year.Prejudging is the kiss of death...because sometimes the most unlikely person is flush.The truth is that improv isn't random and chaotic at all...it's an art form governed by a series of rules, and they want to make sure that when they're up on stage, everyone abides by those rules. One of the most important of the rules that make improv possible, for examples is the idea of agreement, the notion that a very simple way to create a story—or humor—is to have characters accept everything that happens to them. Good improvisors seem telepathic; everything looks pre-arranged. This is because they accept all offers made—which is something no normal person would do.Neither Masten nor Rhea believes that clever packaging allows a company to put out a bad-tasting product. The taste of the product itself matters a great deal. Their point is simply that when we put something in our mouth and in that blink of an eye decide whether it tastes good or not, we are reacting not only to the evidence from our taste buds and salivary glands but also to the evidence of our eyes and memories and imaginations, and it is foolish of company to service one dimension and ignore the other.Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process. Silvan Tomkins one began a lecture by bellowing, ""The face is like a penis!"" What he meant was that the face has, to a large extent, a mind of its own.Imagine if there were a switch that all of us had, to turn off the expressions on our face at will. If babies had that switch, we wouldn't know what they were feeling. They'd be in trouble. You could make an argument, if you wanted to, that the system evolved so that parents would be able to take care of kids.People with autism...have difficulty interpreting non-verbal cues, such as gestures and facial expressions...in anything less than a perfectly literal environment, the autistic person is lost.In the interviews with police officers who have been involved with shootings, these same details appear again and again: extreme visual clarity, tunnel vision, diminished sound, and the sense that time is slowing down. This is how the human body reacts to extreme stress, and it makes sense. Our mind, faced with a life-threatening situation, drastically limits the range and amount of information that we have to deal with. Sound and memory and broader social understanding are sacrificed in favor of heightened awareness of the threat directly in front of us."

We make split-second judgements. Some people more accurately than others. This does not always mean what we think it means.Okay....I guess when the subtitle of a book has the words ""power"" and ""thinking"" in it (""The Power of Thinking Without Thinking""), I expect to gain something from it. Instead I feel like the author explains all the reasons why we should not be relying on snap judgements, despite the fact that some of the time, they are right. I don't find ""some"" to be very useful. If a person can't rely on first impressions, or what the author refers to as ""thin slice"" representations of performance or taste, what good is there in talking about it at all?Then I started thinking about why I read this book in the first place. When the new president of the university where I work started, he talked extensively about Malcolm Gladwell. He referenced this book as well as Outliers. I felt like if I read them, I would understand where he was coming from, and some of the changes he has been making. I have to admit that knowing how much of a decision people make in that first moment could have an impact on how a place is marketed. Even if first impressions don't necessarily become our opinions later on, they still have the power to make a decision in a person's mind, for better or for worse. Still, I'm not sure how you can make that work for you. Is it better to be super-sweet Pepsi that people prefer at the first sip, or more popular Coca-Cola which people are more likely to drink an entire bottle/can of, and make a repeat purchase of? I'd rather be Coke. Can you manufacture enough of a Pepsi experience and then also be Coke? That sounds dangerous to me, because I'm not sure you can be both.""People are ignorant of the things that affect their actions, yet they rarely feel ignorant. We need to accept our ignorance and say 'I don't know' more often.""""How good people's decisions are under the fast-moving, high-stress conditions of rapid cognition is a function of training and rules and rehearsal.""Gladwell does seem to be saying that if you understand the limitations of snap-judgments, you can train yourself to try to lessen bias, prejudice, and incorrect assumptions. It seems to me that the bigger trick is understanding when and how you are doing this to begin with. Write me a book about how to do that, Mr. Gladwell."
56,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/622323-snezan,4,"This work is worth a read, if not more than one. I hesitate to say too much, since I believe the conclusions it reaches are explored in the very beginning and will immediately inform the reader of its relevance. I don't know why that came out so long winded, the reader will find out how interested they are by the first or second chapter.I found the book fascinating for its close look into social interactions, particularly between two people, and for explaining why i sometimes I think the way that I do. The intuitive process of understanding is one that has made a lot of sense to me, and I am glad this book takes a microscope to that underpinning of society's operation. The examples in the book are relevant, timely and buttress the argument well. Especially the story about the psychologist that has a 90 percent success rate of whether a relationship would last past 7 years. The author's decision to skip a little exposition on detractors from the intuitive system of problem solving was a little disappointing, although I do understand that Blink is not, nor pretends to be a scholarly work. Instead it purports to be a lighthouse for a part of our decision-making that is often ignored in society and stays hidden from our conscious understanding. We often don't know why we like or dislike someone the way we do, and yet we allow that judgment to affect our interaction extremely or waffle endlessly over trying to deny or prove our first impression. How many times do you remember saying "" really wanted to like that,"" that being a dress or a person or a book and how much time has it wasted. Or why it sometimes take only a moment for a person to decide whether or not an idea has merit. Gladwell explores those snap judgments in details, and writes in a readable, approachable way. He is not afraid to tackle some controversial topics."
57,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6940509-hannah,1,"1 Star - Horrible book.Against my better judgement I gave another one of Malcolm Gladwell's books a try. Oh, what precious reading time I wasted on this book! My feelings on this book are quite similar to how I felt about The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (my review) so I'll keep this review short. My first thought after finishing this was: did I really just read 200+ pages on what is essentially the good and bad of gut reactions? There was nothing new for me here and that may not entirely be Gladwell's fault but nevertheless I could not enjoy this book. In addition to my lack of interest in the subject matter, I cannot enjoy the author's writing style. I feel he meanders and that there are so many unfinished thoughts and ideas. It drove me crazy!By the end of the book I was frustrated and upset. I recommend this book to no one. "
58,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15355957-rohit-enghakat,3,"Blink is an interesting read. The book is about making decisions in the blink of an eye, to be precise. The author says that decisions which are made instantly are far more fruitful than those made with long drawn research and logical thinking. He cites many examples which are also interesting to read. For example, the description of the Amadou Diallo incident where police officers shot an unarmed black immigrant in New York with forty-one bullets was stunning. Equally interesting was the last example of Abbie Connant playing the trombone traditionally played by a male in the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra.However, somehow the theory did not appeal to me. It is almost akin to relying on sixth sense, although the author tries to prove this scientifically. The book might appeal more to psychologists or psychiatrists. "

60,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174974-matt-kosinski,2,"Here's Blink in a nutshell:Split decisions can be good; better than decisions where we take a lot of time to carefully weigh our options and use scientific evidence. Except when they're not.Rapid cognition is an exciting and powerful way to use your brain's quick, intuitive capabilities to make stunningly accurate decisions, and can even lead you to have better success in sports, business and politics. Except when it won't.We should learn to trust our snap judgments, even in seemingly complex situations where we don't have a lot of information.Except not really.Basically the book gives scientific and anecdotal evidence on why rapid cognition can be both a good and bad thing, without offering us much advise on how to tell the difference between situations where we should or shouldn't trust our instincts. There are many times when I felt that Gladwell contradicted himself. To support his ""rapid cognition is good"" section of the book, he uses an example of a psychological test where students were able to tell whether or not a professor was good at their job by simply watching a 5 second clip of them lecturing with the sound turned off. The results basically corresponded with impressions given by other students who spent an entire class with those professors - thus proving that there is some mysterious and powerful part of our subconscious that can make accurate snap judgments.But then later on in the book, in the ""rapid cognition is bad"" section, Gladwell warns us that, in general, people instantly like tall, attractive white people better than short, unattractive minorities.WELL DUH! OBVIOUSLY THE STUDENTS RATING THE PROFESSORS WERE BIASED BY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE TALL, WHITE, OR ATTRACTIVE! Mystery solved!While Gladwell brings up some interesting concepts, his book never gels into a coherent whole. I read most of it in under a day and already my rapid cognition is telling me it's not worth finishing."
61,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72368-doc-opp,1,"As an empirical psychologist by training, I get very annoyed at journalists who simplify things to the point that its no longer even remotely accurate. Such is the case for Blink. This is especially annoying to me, because the book describes my area of research specialization. If you're interested in a fun read, Gladwell is certainly an engaging author. If you're looking for something that accurately describes the research, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. For example, Scott Plous's ""the psychology of judgment and decision making"" (which, despite the title, is not textbook like), or the Heath brothers' ""Made to stick"". "

Blink
 is- what all the stories, case studies, and arguments add up to- an attempt to understand the magical and mysterious thing called Judgement. Its basic premise is: split second decisions (snap judgements); how they can be good and bad. Gladwell suggests split-seconds decisions are better than the decisions where we take considerable time to weigh our choices and options. He points out that our mind figure things, people, et al. in a blink of an eye. And it is often that these snap judgements are much more trustworthy than judgements arrived at rationally. But he does not stop here and goes on further: snap judgements can be misleading, too; he termed it Warren Harding error. He suggested that there are some instinctive processes that prevent us to see clearly; and hence cloud our judgements. Blink is an interesting read. It is very well written, and at the same time engages your attention from the start. And writing is reader friendly, perfectly suitable for a layman..................................................I bought this book because I was intrigued by the subtitle of the book: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking. This subtitle was something Zen like, I felt. And when I read it initially, three years ago, I found it resembling with Zen teachings (and koans). Following are two quotes that mainly convey the spirit: ""They were so focused on the mechanics and the process that they never looked at the problem holistically. In the act of tearing something apart, you lose its meaning.""""When making a decision of minor importance its advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital matters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the decision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life , we should be governed by the deep inner needs of our nature."""
63,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/546634-ashley,5,"I would put this book in the category of ""Freakonomics"" and ""The Tipping Point."" By the same author as the latter title, Malcolm Gladwell, the purpose of this book is to weigh the advantages as well as the disadvantages of the power of the mind's ability to unconsciously leap to conclusions based on what is seen in the proverbial blink of an eye. While I have read some negative reviews of Gladwell's book, mostly citing that he fails to inform the reader how to know when to go with your gut and when not to, as well as arguments that he urges readers not to follow their gut when the gut instincts are politically incorrect, I have to disagree with many of them. I think that Gladwell's objective in ""Blink"" is to make the reader simply aware of their gut instincts and to urge them to consider trusting it more frequently than we do. People tend to make decisions that are supported by a litany of rationalizations and explanations, but do we always really have reasons for why we do or think what we do? Gladwell is arguing that we don’t, and that sometimes it takes the unconscious mind to make those decisions for us. On the flip side, he also argues that sometimes we unconsciously make negative decisions based on that same quick judgment and our predetermined stereotypes, such as with people of other sexes or other races than ourselves. “Blink” was a very complicated book with many facets and it’s hard to explain all of them or review them all without writing an essay. In the end, I think the main goal isn’t perfect knowledge of the subject of thinking without thinking, but rather consideration of it and how it can benefit us or hinder us both individually and as a society."
64,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186516-margaret-ross,3,"I think this book wins my prize for Most Easily Misinterpreted to Serve Personal Agendas. Gladwell gets so into the interesting details of the case he's building, he really doesn't emphasize the final conclusions of the book at all, leaving people to think that the interesting details are the whole point, which is unfortunate. But then again, I'm not 100% sure I got the whole point.Most of the folks I know think that this book is about how a person's gut instincts can be a better read of a situation than a read based on thorough study. Which is an idea that most people love, since they don't want to have to do all that boring study anyhow. What's missing from that analysis is that Gladwell later insists (but only at the very end of the book, and almost in passing) that it's the thorough active training and study of a subject that allow a person to have ""true"" or ""correct"" gut reads. The guy who can tell who's getting divorced after 60 seconds of hearing them talk spent years coding verbal and physical cues in couples, studying them intensely for years before he was able to give his 60 second analysis. The art historians were drawing on a vast body of knowledge when they made their judgment about the statue. The cop who read fear instead of aggression and didn't shoot couldn't name what he was seeing, but he'd seen it before. Then he also says that our gut reactions can be easily colored by training we don't even know is there- our prejudices, whether unknown or unacknowledged- influence or reads of a situation as well.Ultimately, I saw this book as a reaction to and analysis of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, with some tips for how to avoid such future tragedies. In that light, I thought it was interesting and even constructive, but only if you pay close attention to the last chapter. "

The book begins with the story of the Getty Kouros (Archaic Greek sculptors reduced human anatomy and musculature in these statues to decorative patterning on the surface of the marble.), which was a statue brought to the J. Paul Getty Museum in California. It was thought by many experts to be legitimate, but when others first looked at it, their initial responses were skeptical.

چشم به‌ هم زدن ــ و همه این‌ها به آن سادگی‌ها که به‌ دیده می‌آیند نیستند؛ چرا برخی از افراد، تصمیم‌ گیرهای والایی هستند، در حالی‌که برخی دیگر ناتوانند؟ چرا برخی پیرو غرایزشان هستند، و برنده می‌شوند، در حالی‌که عده‌ ای دیگر، در اشتباه، دست‌ و پا می‌زنند؟ مغز ما واقعا در اداره، در کلاس، در آشپزخانه، و در خانه، چگونه کار می‌کند؟ و چرا اغلب بهترین تصمیمات، آن‌هایی هستند که توضیحشان برای دیگران، ناممکن است؟ در کتاب «یک نگاه» با روان‌شناسی آشنا می‌شویم، که می‌داند چطور با مشاهده ی چند دقیقه‌ ای صحبت زوج‌ها، طول زندگی زناشویی آن‌ها را، پیش‌بینی کند؛ مربی تنیسی، که می‌داند پیش از اصابت راکت با

بلکه کسانی هستند که هنر تمام عیار «برش نازک» را دارند، یعنی از بین انواع وسژگیهای مربوط به یک مسئله، اصلی‌ترین آن‌ها را جدا می‌کنندنقل نمونه متن: «پیش درآمد: مجسمه ای که اصل نبود؛ در سپتامبر 1983میلادی، یک دلال آثار هنری به نام جیان فرانکو به چینا به موزه پاول گتی کالیفرنیا مراجعه کرد؛ او ادعا میکرد مجسمه مرمرینی در اختیار دارد که متعلق به شش قرن پیش از میلاد است؛ این مجسمه معروف به کورس بود ـ مجسمه ای از یک مرد جوان برهنه ایستاده با دستانی از دوطرف آویخته و پای چپ جلو نهاده؛ تا آن زمان در حدود دویست مجسمه کورسی از حفاریهای باستانشناسی یا گورهای قدیمی به دست آمده بود که اغلب آنها در هنگام اکتشاف یا متلاشی شده بودند و یا بدجوری آسیب دیده بودند، اما این یکی تقریبا سالم مانده بود؛ ارتفاع این مجسمه نزدیک به دومتر و بیست و پنج سانتیمتر بود و شفافیتی داشت که آن را از بقیه مجسمه های اکتشافی متمایز میکرد؛ این یک کشف خارق العاده بود و مبلغ پیشنهادی به چینا زیر ده میلیون دلار بود؛ موزه گتی با احتیاط وارد عمل شد؛ مجسمه کورس را به امانت گرفت و تحقیق دقیقی را شروع کرد؛ آیا مجسمه با بقیه مجسمه های کورسی همخوانی داشت؟ جواب به ظاهر آری بود؛ شیوه ی ساخت آن به نظر مشابه مجسمه کورس آناویسوس در موزه ملی باستان شناسی آتن بود، و معنایش این بود که با زمان و مکان خاصی مطابقت داشت؛ این مجسمه از کجا و چه زمانی پیدا شده بود؟ هیچکس به طور دقیق نمیدانست؛ اما به چینا مدارکی به اداره حقوقی موزه گتی ارائه داد که حاوی تاریخچه اخیر آن بود؛ طبق مدارک موجود، کورس از سال 1930میلادی در کلکسیون خصوصی یک پزشک سوییسی به نام لوفن برگر نگهداری میشد، که خود او نیز آن را از دلال معروف آثار هنری یونانی به نام روسس خریده بود؛ برای بررسیهای دقیق، زمین شناسی به نام استنلی مارگولیس از دانشگاه کالیفرنیا به موزه آمد و به مدت دو روز سطح مجسمه را با یک استریو میکروسکوپ بسیار حساس مورد آزمایش قرار داد و بعد از زیر زانوی راست مجسمه تکه ای به قطر یک سانتیمتر و طول دو سانتیمتر جدا کرد و با استفاده از میکروسکوپ الکترونی، اشعه انکساری ایکس و اشعه فلورسنسی ایکس به تجزیه آن پرداختمارگولیس به این نتیجه رسید که مجسمه از سنگ مرمر دُلومیت معدن قدیمی کیپ وتی در جزیره تاسوس ساخته شده، و سطح مجسمه با لایه نازکی از کربنات آهک پوشیده شده است ــ که به گفته وی از اهمیت خاصی برخوردار بود ــ زیرا دُلومیت تنها در طول قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند تبدیل به کربنات آهک شود؛ به عبارت دیگر مجسمه شیئی قدیمی بود و تقلبی نبودموزه گتی از این مسئله خشنود بود، و چهارده ماه پس از شروع تحقیقات با خریدن مجسمه موافقت شد؛ در پاییز 1986میلادی مجسمه برای اولین بار به نمایش گذاشته شد؛ نیویورک تایمز حکایت آنرا در صفحه ی اول خود آورد؛ چند ماه بعد متصدی اموال عتیقه ی موزه، ماریون ترو، گزارشی پرشور و بلندبالا از دستیابی موزه به مجسمه، برای مجله برلینگتون نوشت: «اکنون کورس با قامتی برافراشته و دستانی مشت شده حیات مطمئن خویش را که برترین خصلت او و برادرانش است ابراز میکند.» و سپس پیروزمندانه نتیجه گیری کرد: «او چه خدا باشد و چه انسان تجسم کامل نیروی تابناک بلوغ هنری غرب است.»؛ با تمام این احوال مشکلی وجود داشت؛ مجسمه به نظر اصل نمیآمد، اولین کسیکه به این مشکل اشاره کرد، فردی بود به نام فدریکو زِری، مورخ هنرشناس ایتالیایی، که عضو هیئت امنای موزه نیز بود؛ وقتی «زِری» در دسامبر 1983میلادی به محل نگهداری مجسمه رفت، تا آن را ببیند، بی اختیار به ناخنهای آن خیره شد؛ البته نمیخواست توضیحی برای این مسئله بدهد، اما به نظرش یک جای کار ایراد داشت؛ نفر بعدی «اِوِلین هریسون»، یکی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی بود، که هنگام معامله نهایی، در «لس آنجلس» بود؛ او چنین به خاطر میآورد: آن زمان آرتور هافتن متصدی موزه بود، و ما را برای بازدید برد؛ او با یک حرکت پارچه روی مجسمه را پس زد و گفت، «خُب، این هنوز مال ما نیست اما تا چند هفته دیگر خواهد شد.»؛ و من گفتم: «خیلی متاسفم که این را میشنوم.»، هریسون چه دیده بود؟ خودش نمیداند؛ در همان لحظه اول، وقتی «هافتن» پارچه را کنار زده بود، آنچه «هریسون» حس کرده بود، یک الهام بود، یک احساس غریزی از اینکه چیزی آن وسط اشکال داشت؛چند ماه بعد «هافتن»، «تامس هاوینگ» مدیر سابق موزه «متروپولتین» را برای بازدید از مجسمه، به کارگاه مرمّت موزه برد؛ «هاوینگ» همیشه اولین کلمه ای را که با دیدن چیزی از ذهنش میگذرد یادداشت میکند؛ و هرگز فراموش نمیکند اولین کلمه ای که با دیدن «کورس» از ذهنش گذشت چه بود؛هاوینگ میگوید: «آن کلمه «تازه» بود ــ «تازه»، و «تازه» برای مجسمه ای که دوهزار سال قدمت دارد کلمه مناسبی نیست.»؛ «هاوینگ» بعدها که راجع به آن لحظه فکر کرد، فهمید چرا چنین کلمه ای به ذهنش خطور کرده بود: «من در سیسیلی حفاری کرده بودم، جاییکه تکه ها و قطعاتی از این دست پیدا میشوند، اما این یکی به هیچ کدام شبیه نبود؛ به نظر میرسید این مجسمه کورس از توی یکی از همین قوطیهای قهوه مرغوب استارباکس بیرون آمده باشد!» «هاوینگ» رو به «هافتن» پرسید، «آیا برای آن پولی هم پرداخته اید؟» و وقتی با چهره متعجب هافتن مواجه شد، گفت، «اگر پرداخته اید سعی کنید پس بگیرید و معامله را فسخ کنید.»؛ مسئولان موزه «گتی» کم کم داشتند نگران میشدند، بنابراین سمپوزیوم ویژه ای در مورد کورس در یونان برپا کردند؛ مجسمه را بسته بندی کردند و به یونان فرستادند، و از متخصصان ارشد مجسمه شناسی دعوت کردند؛ اینبار زمزمه یاس و دلهره بلندتر به گوش میرسید؛ «هریسون» در کنار مردی ایستاده بود که نامش «جرج دِس پینیس» بود، و رئیس موزه «آرکوپولیس آتن»؛ «جرج دس پینیس» نگاهی به کورس انداخت و رنگش پرید؛ او رو به هریسون گفت: «هر کس یکبار در عمرش مجسمه ای را که از دل خاک بیرون کشیده شده، دیده باشد میتواند تشخیص دهد، این یکی زیرزمین نبوده است.» «جورجیوس دانتاس»، رئیس جمعیت باستانشناسی آتن، به محض اینکه مجسمه را دید تنش یخ کرد؛ او گفت: «وقتی برای اولین بار کورس را دیدم احساس کردم انگار شیشه ای بین من و مجسمه کشیده شده است.»؛در سمپوزیوم، «آنجلوس دِلی وریاس» مدیر موزه «بناکی آتن» نیز گفته های «دانتاس» را تایید کرد؛ او به تفصیل از تناقض بین سبک ساخت مجسمه، و این واقعیت که مرمر آن از معادن تاسوس استخراج شده است، صحبت کرد، و سپس به اصل مطلب رسید؛ چرا او فکر میکرد که مجسمه تقلبی است؟ زیرا وقتی برای اولین بار به آن نگاه انداخته بود موجی از ادراک و دافعه ی حسی در او برانگیخته شده بود؛ زمانیکه سمپوزیوم به پایان رسید در بین اکثر مدعوین این اتفاق نظر وجود داشت، که کورس ابدا آن چیزی نیست که تصور میشدموزه گتی با تمامی متخصصان و وکلای خود و ماهها بررسی دقیق به یک نتیجه رسیده بود، و برخی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی ــ تنها با یک نگاه و احساس دافعه حسی ــ به نتیجه ای دیگر؛ حق با کدام یک بود؟ برای مدتی هیچ چیز مشخص نبود؛ کورس تبدیل به مسئله ای شده بود که متخصصان هنری در کنفرانسهای مختلف بر سر آن بحث و جدل میکردند؛ اما بعد، اندک اندک، ابهامات ماجرای گتی شروع به روشن شدن نمود؛ برای مثال نامه هایی که وکلای گتی به دقت پیگیری کرده بودند و مشخص میکرد که کورس متعلق به یک پزشک سوییسی بوده، جعلی از آب درآمد؛ یکی از نامه هایی که به تاریخ 1952میلادی بود دارای یک کدپستی بود، که تا بیست سال پس از آن تاریخ هنوز وجود خارجی نداشت؛ نامه دیگری که تاریخ 1955میلادی را داشت، به یک حساب بانکی اشاره داشت، که تا تاریخ 1963میلادی هنوز افتتاح نشده بود؛ در اصل نتیجه ی ماهها تحقیق فقط این شد که کورس موزه گتی همان سبک مجسمه آناویسوس را داشت، اما این نتیجه گیری نیز مورد شک بود؛هرچه متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی دقیقتر به آن نگاه میکردند بیشتر به التقاطی بودن آن پی میبردند؛ هر قسمت از اندام مجسمه مربوط به زمان و مکان متفاوتی بود؛ اندام باریک مرد جوان بیشتر شبیه کورس تنه آ بود که در موزه مونیخ نگهداری میشد، و موهای خوش حالتش شبیه کورس موزه متروپولتین نیویورک؛ و در این بین پاهایش چیزی نبودند جز هنر مدرن، از قضا این مجسمه از همه بیشتر شبیه مجسمه شکسته و کوچکتری بود که در سال 1990میلادی، توسط یک هنرشناس بریتانیایی در سوییس پیدا شده بود؛ هر دو مجسمه از یک سنگ مرمر مشابه و با یک سبک تراشیده شده بود؛ اما کورس سوییسی متعلق به گذشته نبود، بلکه در اوایل دهه هشتاد در کارگاهی در رم ساخته شده بود؛ پس تحقیقات علمی که مشخص میکرد سطح مجسمه کورس تنها پس از قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند به چنین شکلی درآید چه؟ خوب آن نتایج همچندان قطعی نبودند؛ طبق آزمایشها و بررسیهای بعدی زمینشناس دیگری به این نتیجه رسید، که با استفاده از کپک سیب زمینی، میتوان در عرض چند ماه سطح مجسمه مرمر دلومیتی را به شکل کهنه و قدیمی درآورد؛ در کاتالوگ موزه گتی تصویری از مجسمه کورس چاپ شده که زیر آن نوشته شده «حدود ۵۳۰سال قبل از میلاد، یا، مدرن جعلی.»؛ زمانیکه «فدریکو زری» و «اِوِلین هریسون» و «تامس هاوینگ» و «جورجیوس دانتاس» ــ و خیلیهای دیگر ــ با یک نگاه به مجسمه دچار دافعه حسی شدند مطمئنا حق داشتند؛ آنها در همان دو ثانیه اول ـ در یک نگاه ـ به شناختی از ماهیت مجسمه دست یافتند که تیم تخصصی موزه گتی پس از چهارده ماه تحقیق هنوز به آن نرسیده بود؛ یک نگاه کتابی است درباره ی همان دو ثانیه نخست.»؛ پایان نقلا. شربیانی"
66,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"O, to have the writing career of Malcolm Gladwell. The man pulls interesting case studies from academic research and news headlines, spins it into a book under a general theme, and blammo! He has a bestseller. This formula worked for him with The Tipping Point and then Blink. Blink is a compelling read, despite its weak overall theme, which is that sometimes split-second decisions are good and sometimes they're bad, and we need to learn when to trust our first impressions and when to discount them (except there's no real way to make that distinction). The book is a pleasure to read simply because of its case studies. Gladwell throws in so many topics — art, politics, marriage, consumer testing, athletes, war, police shootings, music — that there is bound to be something engaging for everyone. (After reading another one of Gladwell's peppy articles in The New Yorker, my husband joked, ""Gladwell thinks he can make ANYTHING seem interesting."")After finishing Blink, I feel like I've learned something important, but I'm not sure exactly what, other than that Gladwell has a very charmed career.My rating: 3.5 stars rounded up to 4"
67,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,3,"This was a big best-seller for Gladwell. He posits that much of the time we make decisions, reach conclusions in a sort of pre-conscious manner that he calls “thin-slicing.” That means taking a very small sample, a thin slice, and making a decision immediately based on that information. However, it is the case that the ability to evaluate that slice is fed by a lifetime of experience. It is not simply, as some, including President Bush the second, might believe, that using one’s gut, in the absence of years and years of preparation, is as valid a way of reaching decisions as taking the longer route of careful analysis of available data. No, no, no."
68,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"I generally distrust anyone who says that they ‘go-with-their-gut’. But when the company I work for announced a major decision a few years back, I instantly said, “This is going to be a huge mistake.” Smart people had examined the deal backwards and forwards for months and thought it was a great idea. I had a bad feeling about it that I could only later explain, and I was far from the only one. And we were right. The entire thing turned out to be a huge disaster. I kept thinking about that incident when I read Blink. The book has a pretty obvious point. People make snap decisions that they can’t consciously explain. Sometimes these decisions are correct and amazing based on the limited amount of information available. Art experts who instantly know a statue is fake despite scientific tests indicating otherwise. A fireman who appears to be fighting a routine small fire suddenly orders his men out without really knowing why and the floor collapses a second later. And sometimes these decisions can be wrong and have tragic consequences. Four cops think a guy has a gun when he’s pulling his wallet out and shoot him multiple times.We’ve all made quick decisions and later been amazed at how good or bad they turned out, but what makes Blink interesting is that Gladwell does some examination of the science behind how we arrive at these conclusions, and his thoughts on how the data we’re processing can either give us incredible insight or lead us horribly wrong.Thankfully, Gladwell is not making an argument against logical thinking or analyzing a problem. What he is doing is pointing out that instinct or intuition can be a powerful tool IF the people involved have trained themselves to make good decisions, and if we know when to trust it. He’s got a lot of great examples of doctors, military officers and police officers who often have to make life-or-death decisions in a matter of seconds with limited information. They have to trust their instincts, and Gladwell makes some common sense points that the right kind of training and education can make a huge difference. He contrasts the story of the four New York cops who killed the guy with a wallet versus a patrolman who did not fire on someone who actually had a gun but was attempting to surrender it.What made this book fun to read was the variety of examples that Gladwell uses and the scientific research done with them. Art dealers, doctors, marriage counselors, cops, military officers, car salesmen, a tennis coach, and classical musicians are all used as examples of the strengths and weaknesses of snap decisions. There’s also some simple experiments included that let you play along at home. This is a book that will make you think about the way you think."

70,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak,4,"Much like the reason behind my majoring in Economics, I like Gladwell because he opens my mind to new ideas and new ways to think. Much like Economics, I believe he's far from perfect, but I really enjoy viewing the world through his lens. In just about anything, when people start acting as if there is only one way to do something, I stop listening to them. This goes for many things, but especially politics. If you DO, however, find someone who is omniscient and knows exactly how every policy will turn out in the end, please let me know. I may listen to their one way of seeing the world. Otherwise ...What I got from Blink is that there is a lot to our instant thoughts and feelings and many times much more than we give them credit. The traditional wisdom is to plan and make huge weighty decisions based on every single bit of information that we have at our fingertips (which is just about everything, google!). This is actually a big reason my wife and I get into ... disagreements (we'll go with that). She likes to plan everything down to the last detail and I like to be a bit more relaxed.So it would seem that this book is a big proponent of my way of doing things, but it turns out it's not so much.We should trust our gut-instinct, says Blink, if we have many hours of experience in said realm of understanding because we have developed the skills to make sense of those small details and because we have the ability to ""thin slice."" Gladwell also makes the point that not always can we trust our gut-intinct, however, because our gut-instinct tends to be racist, even when we are not in fact consciously racist. Also, our instincts can get overwhelmed by heightened arousal, such as when people can't even dial 911 in an emergency because their senses are overloaded.But then again, you can practice and have these types of unconscious reactions mitigated.The interesting story-telling style of introducing these topics is, of course, what really gets me. It's the stories that are often unbelievable that have me clamoring for more, just like in Outliers (although I think Outliers was a little better written) and I would assume his other books. He goes into why The Getty art museum spent millions on a fake kouros (Greek statue) and why cops probably aren't racial profiling when they beat people like Rodney King, but because of a few key mistakes such as allowing their unconscious to get overwhelmed and also because they were a group of officers instead of just one.He talks about people who can listen to a couple and tell when they should start talking to their lawyers and people who have developed the actual abilities that are shown in the TV show ""Lie to Me."" How looking at a person's room for 5 minutes may give a complete stranger a better picture of a person than a good friend. I've always loved these types of explanations for things. There's the old wisdom we have and the wisdom we assume when we don't have any other way to describe a particular event and which is completely wrong. I love thinking new ideas, even when it's old news and that's why I'll keep coming back to Gladwell."
71,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"Elsewhere, in one of my other recent reviews, a GoodReads friend (Richard) told me that he had become less infatuated with this book after reading a review by a specialist in the field who gave it a drubbing. I was worried that knowing this might ruin this book for me – but it has not. I really enjoyed this one too. This is the third of Gladwell’s books I’ve read in quick succession and this contained lots of information about things that have made me think and sparked my interest to learn more. It may well be that Gladwell’s style does not appeal to an expert in the field – and that is quite likely to be true, but I’ve found that it is often the case that I’ve been introduced to themes by popularisers and later went on to read more deeply on a subject. I rarely condemn those who introduce me to fascinating topics – and this is a fascinating topic.I’m not going to do a full review, but rather quickly talk about wine. While he was talking about coke and about taste tests I was thinking about wine. He makes the point that when asked to judge jam people do nearly as well as the experts if they are just asked which jam they liked the most, but do much worse than experts if asked to explain why they graded them in the order that they did. That is, if they have to talk about texture and sweetness and citrus flavours – people change how they judge jam and end up picking the worst jam rather than the best. This is because we don’t really know what ‘texture’ is and so trying to slot jams into categories that we don’t really understand means we are most likely to stuff up and confuse ourselves. Now, wine. I wonder if anyone has ever done a test at cellar doors to see what people end up buying and if they pick the nicest wine for the price, or do they buy vinegar instead? I wouldn’t mind betting that there would be something similar happening here – and if you are with someone who says things like, “Oh yes, fruity, but with a back-taste of coal tar” you might end up buying something that is quite disgusting. You know, unless you actually have some idea of what you are talking about, it might be best to shut up and drink the wine.That is the point of this book – learning when to trust your “immediate reactions” and when to question them. I think there is much in this book that is worth knowing and much that is fascinatingly interesting. (The stuff about unconscious racism is so important that everyone should be forced to read this for that alone). But with Richard, I am a little concerned that an expert in the field didn't like this book. All the same, the expert does recommend Made to Stick so I guess that can be the next book I read.There is – as is proven by Dylan Moran – only one way to pick wine:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2gGf..."
72,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,4,"I reread this after realizing I couldn't remember enough to compare with Kahneman`s book. They are mostly aligning, only Kahneman suggests against making snap judgements and relying more on evidence whereas Gladwell gives views from both sides and stays impartial.Blink is about unconscious decision making. Our unconscious side is fascinating, because it seems to be the one that holds the strings most of the time; making very fast decisions, watching out for any threat to our existence. However when our drives (the motivators of unconscious) are in conflict, ourrational mind is quick to get in. The rational mind is also there to make corrections, and making plans. So it seems that mostly we are on autopilot for unimportant things, and also when we have to do something at lightening speed. But at other times even if there is an urge to act instinctively, one should act relying on data rather than on instinct."
73,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,"Probably the best among Gladwell's books. He still stands true to his success mantra - ""Gladwell - The Power of Inductive Reasoning."" But, it was still a well researched and informative book. Blink."

While I enjoyed The Tipping Point more, I have to say that I am happy to have read this after that particular chapter. This is not to say it's the only one I found interesting, because at least one other one was quite fascinating for me.I do plan to read more books by Gladwell in the future."
75,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1090620-ed,2,"I didn't learn much from this book that I did not already know. I am beginning to suspect that Malcolm Gladwell is not writing books that uncover valuable facts that we should know, but rather is writing books that restate facts we already know but in an interesting way.I like his anecdotal stories very much which is why I finished the book - hoping for more stories. When he lays out the facts, though, his writing is no more interesting than any other scientific author. So, in summary, what we have is a talented writer making certain scientific findings available to a much wider audience than usual. Bravo! However if you want to learn something new, this book or his previous effort, The Tipping Point, is not where to go to find it. I imagine, if I read it, I will find The Outliers, his latest effort, to be similarly constructed.Blink's content is easily summarized. First impressions are often more accurate than conclusions arrived at after much study and analysis. Be careful, though, because first impressions can be troublesome because of people's prejudices. Got it in 254 pages. He does come up with an interesting term, ""thin slicing"", to describe the process of taking in a first impression. Maybe learning that term made reading the whole book worthwhile. Maybe."
76,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"A really great study on how important the first few seconds of anything can be, in any particular situation. Be it that you're an art expert who instantly knows an object is fake, or a police man who thinks that the victim is pulling a gun out of their pocket rather than a wallet, it's very clear that human beings do have this constant auto-pilot running, an unconscious ""survival mode"" that gives us most of the clues we might need in the ""blink"" of an eye, and sometimes those clues might be wrong."
77,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"Gladwell continues his exploration of counter-intuitive ideas about decision-making in BLINK! He opens with a 1983 incident at the J. Paul Getty Museum. The Museum acquired a rare statue from the Greek archaic period. To this day, the Museum maintains that the authenticity of the statue is uncertain. At the time, however, the Museum was certain enough to acquire the piece for just under $10 million. Documentation, and scientific analysis had been relied on as support. However, numerous experts including Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas Hoving pronounced it a fake. It was an intuitive pronouncement which presaged problems later uncovered with both the documentation and scientific analysis. This is the first of many stories Gladwell uses to illustrate how an intuitive reaction can trump logic and analysis.Among the factors that cloud logic is something he calls the adaptive unconscious. It's an unrecognized emotional bias. In the Getty example, the officials wanted the piece to be authentic. It would have been a spectacular acquisition for a newly established museum. This desire diverted critical scrutiny of the supporting evidence. Such an adaptation need not even be emotion based. In an explanation of priming, Gladwell cites psychological studies that illustrate the subconscious effect of pre-conditioning through word lists. Extrapolating from these examples, one might conclude that the casual reader will be highly influenced when reviewing a book by his mood or even surroundings at the time of reading.Gladwell explores other impediments to logical thinking, logic being a type of perceptual filter. Face recognition, he points out, occurs in a completely different part of the brain, and is an integrated reaction as opposed to the kind of multi-step processing that occurs in dealing with language. Athletic and musical achievement rely on these non-verbal neural processes. His own example cites Paul Van Ripper's success against a team backed by the Pentagon's most sophisticated computers in a war games exercise. The Pentagon team was actually hampered in their decision making by information overload. Initial reaction, Gladwell points out is not always accurate. He tries to explore this downside as well by citing studies on bias. Gladwell is an entertaining storyteller as well as an energetic researcher. He draws examples from market research, Chancellorsville in the Civil War, the assessment of heart attacks at Cook County Hospital, speed dating, fire fighting, the auditioning of professional musicians, and the Diallo Incident in the Bronx to illustrate his points. By drawing from such a wide variety of experience, he insures the interest of a broad audience in this book. NOTE: It's always fun to re-encounter characters from other books. I knew of Thomas Hoving from his book, KING OF THE CONFESSORS. The idea of thin-slice thinking was also explored in HOW WE DECIDE, by Jonah Lehrer. The deconstruction of flavor is discussed from a neurophysiological standpoint in Gordon Shepherd's NEUROGASTRONOMY. "

79,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,2,"I was really expecting more from this book. I've heard mostly good things about Gladwell, and he had a pretty interesting TED talk, and I enjoy almost anything to do with the brain, so...why not?The book certainly brought up a lot of interesting ideas and did a good job of discussing the different elements that go into the snap decisions that we make every day. And it's probably worth a read for many of the stories and experiments related. But for the most part this book really failed to impress. More than that though, it failed at being a coherent analysis of what goes on in the human brain when we make snap judgments. Gladwell alternates between telling us to trust and accept this ""mysterious phenomena"" that allows us to make these unconscious snap judgments and warning us against the use of these snap judgments. One moment he advises against the idea that we need to slowly collect data and weigh options to make the most informed opinion and provides examples where too much thinking and information leads us astray, and in the next moment gives us examples of how snap judgments sometimes go horribly wrong. And he leaves us with no clear sense of how to use this new found information to make better decisions and judgments in our own lives. Do I trust my insights because my rational brain will fool me, or do I mistrust my instincts because of the inherent bias contained within them? If Gladwell knows he sure didn't tell me.One example of somewhere where I think he didn't analyze the situation enough was when he talked about the Wisconsin Card Sorting task (pick cards from one of two decks, one deck tends towards bad and the other towards good outcomes). He focused solely on how the unconscious mind was aware of the pattern (which deck was bad and which was good) long before the conscious mind was aware of it when making decisions. And this was shown by the fact that sweating occurred when choosing from the ""bad"" deck before the subject knew why (or was even aware of it). What he fails to mention about all this is that the reason for this is because we are designed to be ""risk averse"". It is not because we are making brilliant snap judgments, or that our brains have ""learned"" the rules before we are aware of it. From an evolutionary perspective it pays off more to learn from our mistakes than learn from our victories. Mistakes are costly. This is why bad memories are more salient than happy ones. The sweating that occurs is a physiological indicator of and means of prompting the organism to stay away. It's not even that this explanation is in contradiction to Gladwell's; it is that it IS an explanation for the phenomena Gladwell describes, one easily at Gladwells' disposal. Two other aspects of this book stuck out as major frustrations for me:1) Gladwell spends a lot of time early on talking about the mysterious nature of our ability to thin slice (make accurate snap judgments based on very little information) and urges us to accept this. To his credit, he does attempt to demystify this somewhat later on, but not enough in my opinion. His first example is of a museum that purchased an expensive sculpture which all the data and scientists evaluated as legitimate, but which experts in the field immediately saw as a fake without being able to put into words why. It's purposefully misleading to label this as some sort of mysterious phenomena. For instance, it's important to remember that these people were experts. An amateur would not and could not make this same snap judgment because they don't have the training to. This ability didn't magically appear, it came from learning and training and synaptic change. These experts learned over time. They studied types of stone, and different styles, and everything else that goes into understanding their field. And this process created memories...synaptic change within their brains. And there exists a system (or systems) in the brain that can make decisions based on that neuronal structure without conscious awareness. Shortcuts so to speak. But these shortcuts are a product of that neuronal structure, which is a product of that synaptic change, which is a product of the learning the individual did over time. It's misleading to call this mysterious. What's important, and more interesting in my opinion, is figuring out the underlying processes that allow this to happen. 2) Towards the end of the book Gladwell discusses how our stress response leads us to make all sorts of bad decisions. He talks about autism and how autistic people can't mind read (don't have theories of other minds) and how this affects their interpretation of events around them and of the world in general. He compares what happens to people in stressful situations to this, that during these situations, because the fight or flight response has taken over, people have tunnel vision and can no longer ""read minds"" and thus make all sorts of mistakes and bad decisions because they are focusing on the wrong things. My issue is that he, incomprehensibly, makes a literal, as opposed to metaphorical, connection with autism. He argues that during these times we become ""temporarily autistic"". While it's true that one aspect of our behavior becomes similar to an aspect of an autistic individuals behavior during these times, it seems like a pretty ridiculous statement to make as a broad generalization. He spends quite a bit of time talking about this and I don't think it does anyone any good.In the end I think I was most disappointed by the fact that all the elements to create a good book WERE present here, and the failure is due in large part to how he puts it all together and his ability to analyze all the disparate ideas properly (insert irony here). Evolution has built into us shortcuts to react quickly to stimuli in our environment. Our experience, whether broadly cultural or personal, prunes, enhances, changes those built in shortcuts as we go through life. Some develop as unfair biases towards people of different races. Some develop as we become experts in a subject. Thus some can be trusted and some can't. Our brains can't tell the difference between fact and fiction, only between experience and non experience, and so it's important to be aware of what kind of decision making goes on under the surface and what factors are involved in those decisions so we can be more aware of whether to trust them or not. Other factors can affect decision making, such as our emotional state due to the physiological changes that take place during those times, and this too is important to understand because it radically alters our perception during those times. The most important thing to remember is that experience translates into instinct through synaptic change, and through work and training we can increase the effectiveness of our gut reactions and snap decisions, but due to biases and our altered states during emotional situations those instincts should not always be trusted outright. There you go Malcolm Gladwell, please feel free to use this in the next printing. No citation necessary. "
80,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Malcolm Gladwell engagingly writes about how decisions made in a blink--snap judgments--can be very good. A series of entertaining anecdotes and psychological studies show that first impressions can be good in some cases, especially in areas where people have experience. He also writes about experts who analyze facial expressions, and how autistic people have trouble making certain types of judgment calls.But then he goes on to show how our unconscious mind can also be very prejudiced. Tall men are more likely to become CEOs than short men. Using Warren Harding as an example, he shows that people may vote for a political candidate because they look presidential. Women are less likely to be offered positions in some orchestras unless the auditions are held with the competitors behind a screen, so they are just evaluated on their playing ability. He also includes stories about police officers making snap judgments, and the judicial system handing out longer sentences to minorities. There were some examples that supported decisions made quickly by the subconscious level, and other examples that showed certain decisions were better when we slowed down and consciously gave things a little more thought. Experience played a big part in having good judgment making quick decisions. Gladwell does not get into how the brain works in making decisions. The book is interesting and entertaining, but it raises as many questions as it answers. 3.5 stars."

Even as a general reader, I find this book says a lot of things but does not actually tell you what it actually wants to address. But I love this book for totally different reasons. Firstly, I love case studies with interesting results written by someone who can write in a way you will find the whole experience exhilarating. Secondly, this guy deserves a five star because he is making less known but thought-provoking scientific studies to a much wider audience. Thirdly, nowhere it is mentioned in the title it is a book which teaches you how to think without thinking so it is completely understandable why it shows us both the advantages and disadvantages of snap decision making and it completely leaves to the reader to decide when to do what. Finally, I love non-fiction which uses a lot of anecdotes to state a fact rather just directly stating the fact it wants to address. I recommend it to anyone who loves to read about interesting psychological studies. "

83,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/337591-zinta,5,"Where does it all go, after you are done experiencing the experience, thinking the thought, feeling the feeling? Nothing is ever lost. The subconscious is like a vast warehouse, limitless, in fact, and as Malcolm Gladwell illustrates in Blink, we access all that is stored in that warehouse with every blinking and waking moment.Usually, we call this instant access - gut instinct. Or, the inner voice of wisdom. Instinct, however, is nothing magical or mysterious. It is simply our accumulated and stored knowledge over a lifetime. If there was ever an argument for listening to those who have some serious and well-lived years under their belts, this is it. Blink illustrates with numerous and widely varied examples how life experience, the more the better, contributes to our ability to make quick, yet sound decisions. In fact, the quicker, the better.Blink is about what the author calls ""thin slicing."" He defines this process as the moment of time in which we all make snap judgments. Two seconds, two minutes ... and we make an assessment of a situation or a person or a circumstance. The fascinating thing is - these snap judgments are, more often than not, precise ones. It is when we begin to over analyze and rationalize that we tend to go awry. The trick is to allow the accumulated wisdom rise up and do its magic, trust in it.Then again ...Gladwell never does make a concluding statement in his book, and perhaps it is up to the reader to decide (do it quickly?), but his many fascinating examples and his reports on various studies can lead one to think these snap judgments are the way to go - or, then again, thinker beware. For all the many situations in which that moment of initial wisdom is uncannily precise, there are other times that our deeply ingrained biases muck up the clarity of that process. Gladwell cites data to illustrate how stereotypes, for instance, persist - no matter how gallant our conscious efforts to overcome them. Telling yourself you don't really think what you think simply won't work. Only exposure to experiences, or positive visualizations, will change the false ideas and images our subconscious has absorbed over time. All of which is a strong argument for ""garbage in, garbage out."" That is, be careful of what entertainment you choose (e.g. pornographic images, violent movies or games, etc.), because no matter how hard your conscious mind tries to guide you toward decisions and behavior that is more appropriate, your subconscious will always, but always win out.The idea of what you present to your eye is what you will later project out to the world is a convincing one, as the author finds himself unable to beat the test on stereotypes when he has to react quickly. Only exposure to more positive images over time can change his test results and dislodge his prejudices.Gladwell discusses this phenomena of instant response-true response in a manner of ways. How patients respond to their doctors (we sue the physician who has a lousy bedside manner, even if more skilled, but remain loyal to the physician who spends as little as three extra minutes talking with us); how facial expressions, when viewed on slowed down video, will without fail, always reveal deceit (there are facial movements that arise from our subconscious that we cannot control, and no matter how quickly we think we have our facial mask in place, there is always that instant that our faces tell the truth); the intricacies of marketing and advertisement and why the obvious ad, even when based on feedback of focus groups, may not be the effective choice; how military decisions by experienced military leaders are successful, but fail miserably when they are constrained by strategic analysis; how micro-managing in workplaces can only lead to mediocrity while suppressing creativity and innovation; how speed dating may be most effective in finding potential lifelong connections (we read about research that can pick out successful, longterm relationships in observing as little as two minutes of interaction between a couple - and no, it isn't the couple that argues that breaks apart); how our societal subconscious biases for certain physical characteristics, such as height or gender, often mislead us to make dangerously faulty snap judgments (Gladwell observes that most of our leaders are tall and male, and that our corporate world pays tall men higher salaries, factoring dollars down to the inch, regardless of intelligence or ability). On and on, in one fascinating example and study after another, Gladwell intrigues with his findings.And you know he's right. You know it ... in your gut. But if the author doesn't make any overall conclusion from all of this fascinating data, then the reader is left to her own wiles. Experience counts more than credentials. What we expose ourselves to on a regular basis molds who we are, how we view others, what choices we make and how we behave. Biases and prejudices are far stronger than our conscious will to overcome them; we must align our environment to align our subconscious. Our deepest self forgets nothing. All we have ever done and been and seen and observed leads to who we are today and tomorrow.All of which gives one pause. But don't pause too long. It is that initial millisecond that may matter most of all."

Quotes:But in the end it comes down to a matter of respect, and the simplest way that respect is communicated is through tone of voice.Of the tens of millions of American men below five foot six, a grand total of ten in my sample have reached the level of CEO, which says that being short is probably as much of a handicap to corporate success as being a woman or an African American.Most of us, in ways that we are not entirely aware of, automatically associate leadership ability with imposing physical stature....when corrected for such variables as age and gender and weight, an inch of height is worth $789 a year in salary. That means that a person who is six feet tall but otherwise identical to someone who is five foot five will make on average $5,525 more per year.Prejudging is the kiss of death...because sometimes the most unlikely person is flush.The truth is that improv isn't random and chaotic at all...it's an art form governed by a series of rules, and they want to make sure that when they're up on stage, everyone abides by those rules. One of the most important of the rules that make improv possible, for examples is the idea of agreement, the notion that a very simple way to create a story—or humor—is to have characters accept everything that happens to them. Good improvisors seem telepathic; everything looks pre-arranged. This is because they accept all offers made—which is something no normal person would do.Neither Masten nor Rhea believes that clever packaging allows a company to put out a bad-tasting product. The taste of the product itself matters a great deal. Their point is simply that when we put something in our mouth and in that blink of an eye decide whether it tastes good or not, we are reacting not only to the evidence from our taste buds and salivary glands but also to the evidence of our eyes and memories and imaginations, and it is foolish of company to service one dimension and ignore the other.Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process. Silvan Tomkins one began a lecture by bellowing, ""The face is like a penis!"" What he meant was that the face has, to a large extent, a mind of its own.Imagine if there were a switch that all of us had, to turn off the expressions on our face at will. If babies had that switch, we wouldn't know what they were feeling. They'd be in trouble. You could make an argument, if you wanted to, that the system evolved so that parents would be able to take care of kids.People with autism...have difficulty interpreting non-verbal cues, such as gestures and facial expressions...in anything less than a perfectly literal environment, the autistic person is lost.In the interviews with police officers who have been involved with shootings, these same details appear again and again: extreme visual clarity, tunnel vision, diminished sound, and the sense that time is slowing down. This is how the human body reacts to extreme stress, and it makes sense. Our mind, faced with a life-threatening situation, drastically limits the range and amount of information that we have to deal with. Sound and memory and broader social understanding are sacrificed in favor of heightened awareness of the threat directly in front of us."
85,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,2,"I find this book to say very little in the end, at least, little that is useful or that I can apply. We make split-second judgements. Some people more accurately than others. This does not always mean what we think it means.Okay....I guess when the subtitle of a book has the words ""power"" and ""thinking"" in it (""The Power of Thinking Without Thinking""), I expect to gain something from it. Instead I feel like the author explains all the reasons why we should not be relying on snap judgements, despite the fact that some of the time, they are right. I don't find ""some"" to be very useful. If a person can't rely on first impressions, or what the author refers to as ""thin slice"" representations of performance or taste, what good is there in talking about it at all?Then I started thinking about why I read this book in the first place. When the new president of the university where I work started, he talked extensively about Malcolm Gladwell. He referenced this book as well as Outliers. I felt like if I read them, I would understand where he was coming from, and some of the changes he has been making. I have to admit that knowing how much of a decision people make in that first moment could have an impact on how a place is marketed. Even if first impressions don't necessarily become our opinions later on, they still have the power to make a decision in a person's mind, for better or for worse. Still, I'm not sure how you can make that work for you. Is it better to be super-sweet Pepsi that people prefer at the first sip, or more popular Coca-Cola which people are more likely to drink an entire bottle/can of, and make a repeat purchase of? I'd rather be Coke. Can you manufacture enough of a Pepsi experience and then also be Coke? That sounds dangerous to me, because I'm not sure you can be both.""People are ignorant of the things that affect their actions, yet they rarely feel ignorant. We need to accept our ignorance and say 'I don't know' more often.""""How good people's decisions are under the fast-moving, high-stress conditions of rapid cognition is a function of training and rules and rehearsal.""Gladwell does seem to be saying that if you understand the limitations of snap-judgments, you can train yourself to try to lessen bias, prejudice, and incorrect assumptions. It seems to me that the bigger trick is understanding when and how you are doing this to begin with. Write me a book about how to do that, Mr. Gladwell."
86,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/622323-snezan,4,"This work is worth a read, if not more than one. I hesitate to say too much, since I believe the conclusions it reaches are explored in the very beginning and will immediately inform the reader of its relevance. I don't know why that came out so long winded, the reader will find out how interested they are by the first or second chapter.I found the book fascinating for its close look into social interactions, particularly between two people, and for explaining why i sometimes I think the way that I do. The intuitive process of understanding is one that has made a lot of sense to me, and I am glad this book takes a microscope to that underpinning of society's operation. The examples in the book are relevant, timely and buttress the argument well. Especially the story about the psychologist that has a 90 percent success rate of whether a relationship would last past 7 years. The author's decision to skip a little exposition on detractors from the intuitive system of problem solving was a little disappointing, although I do understand that Blink is not, nor pretends to be a scholarly work. Instead it purports to be a lighthouse for a part of our decision-making that is often ignored in society and stays hidden from our conscious understanding. We often don't know why we like or dislike someone the way we do, and yet we allow that judgment to affect our interaction extremely or waffle endlessly over trying to deny or prove our first impression. How many times do you remember saying "" really wanted to like that,"" that being a dress or a person or a book and how much time has it wasted. Or why it sometimes take only a moment for a person to decide whether or not an idea has merit. Gladwell explores those snap judgments in details, and writes in a readable, approachable way. He is not afraid to tackle some controversial topics."
87,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6940509-hannah,1,"1 Star - Horrible book.Against my better judgement I gave another one of Malcolm Gladwell's books a try. Oh, what precious reading time I wasted on this book! My feelings on this book are quite similar to how I felt about The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (my review) so I'll keep this review short. My first thought after finishing this was: did I really just read 200+ pages on what is essentially the good and bad of gut reactions? There was nothing new for me here and that may not entirely be Gladwell's fault but nevertheless I could not enjoy this book. In addition to my lack of interest in the subject matter, I cannot enjoy the author's writing style. I feel he meanders and that there are so many unfinished thoughts and ideas. It drove me crazy!By the end of the book I was frustrated and upset. I recommend this book to no one. "
88,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15355957-rohit-enghakat,3,"Blink is an interesting read. The book is about making decisions in the blink of an eye, to be precise. The author says that decisions which are made instantly are far more fruitful than those made with long drawn research and logical thinking. He cites many examples which are also interesting to read. For example, the description of the Amadou Diallo incident where police officers shot an unarmed black immigrant in New York with forty-one bullets was stunning. Equally interesting was the last example of Abbie Connant playing the trombone traditionally played by a male in the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra.However, somehow the theory did not appeal to me. It is almost akin to relying on sixth sense, although the author tries to prove this scientifically. The book might appeal more to psychologists or psychiatrists. "

90,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174974-matt-kosinski,2,"Here's Blink in a nutshell:Split decisions can be good; better than decisions where we take a lot of time to carefully weigh our options and use scientific evidence. Except when they're not.Rapid cognition is an exciting and powerful way to use your brain's quick, intuitive capabilities to make stunningly accurate decisions, and can even lead you to have better success in sports, business and politics. Except when it won't.We should learn to trust our snap judgments, even in seemingly complex situations where we don't have a lot of information.Except not really.Basically the book gives scientific and anecdotal evidence on why rapid cognition can be both a good and bad thing, without offering us much advise on how to tell the difference between situations where we should or shouldn't trust our instincts. There are many times when I felt that Gladwell contradicted himself. To support his ""rapid cognition is good"" section of the book, he uses an example of a psychological test where students were able to tell whether or not a professor was good at their job by simply watching a 5 second clip of them lecturing with the sound turned off. The results basically corresponded with impressions given by other students who spent an entire class with those professors - thus proving that there is some mysterious and powerful part of our subconscious that can make accurate snap judgments.But then later on in the book, in the ""rapid cognition is bad"" section, Gladwell warns us that, in general, people instantly like tall, attractive white people better than short, unattractive minorities.WELL DUH! OBVIOUSLY THE STUDENTS RATING THE PROFESSORS WERE BIASED BY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE TALL, WHITE, OR ATTRACTIVE! Mystery solved!While Gladwell brings up some interesting concepts, his book never gels into a coherent whole. I read most of it in under a day and already my rapid cognition is telling me it's not worth finishing."
91,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72368-doc-opp,1,"As an empirical psychologist by training, I get very annoyed at journalists who simplify things to the point that its no longer even remotely accurate. Such is the case for Blink. This is especially annoying to me, because the book describes my area of research specialization. If you're interested in a fun read, Gladwell is certainly an engaging author. If you're looking for something that accurately describes the research, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. For example, Scott Plous's ""the psychology of judgment and decision making"" (which, despite the title, is not textbook like), or the Heath brothers' ""Made to stick"". "

Blink
 is- what all the stories, case studies, and arguments add up to- an attempt to understand the magical and mysterious thing called Judgement. Its basic premise is: split second decisions (snap judgements); how they can be good and bad. Gladwell suggests split-seconds decisions are better than the decisions where we take considerable time to weigh our choices and options. He points out that our mind figure things, people, et al. in a blink of an eye. And it is often that these snap judgements are much more trustworthy than judgements arrived at rationally. But he does not stop here and goes on further: snap judgements can be misleading, too; he termed it Warren Harding error. He suggested that there are some instinctive processes that prevent us to see clearly; and hence cloud our judgements. Blink is an interesting read. It is very well written, and at the same time engages your attention from the start. And writing is reader friendly, perfectly suitable for a layman..................................................I bought this book because I was intrigued by the subtitle of the book: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking. This subtitle was something Zen like, I felt. And when I read it initially, three years ago, I found it resembling with Zen teachings (and koans). Following are two quotes that mainly convey the spirit: ""They were so focused on the mechanics and the process that they never looked at the problem holistically. In the act of tearing something apart, you lose its meaning.""""When making a decision of minor importance its advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital matters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the decision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life , we should be governed by the deep inner needs of our nature."""
93,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/546634-ashley,5,"I would put this book in the category of ""Freakonomics"" and ""The Tipping Point."" By the same author as the latter title, Malcolm Gladwell, the purpose of this book is to weigh the advantages as well as the disadvantages of the power of the mind's ability to unconsciously leap to conclusions based on what is seen in the proverbial blink of an eye. While I have read some negative reviews of Gladwell's book, mostly citing that he fails to inform the reader how to know when to go with your gut and when not to, as well as arguments that he urges readers not to follow their gut when the gut instincts are politically incorrect, I have to disagree with many of them. I think that Gladwell's objective in ""Blink"" is to make the reader simply aware of their gut instincts and to urge them to consider trusting it more frequently than we do. People tend to make decisions that are supported by a litany of rationalizations and explanations, but do we always really have reasons for why we do or think what we do? Gladwell is arguing that we don’t, and that sometimes it takes the unconscious mind to make those decisions for us. On the flip side, he also argues that sometimes we unconsciously make negative decisions based on that same quick judgment and our predetermined stereotypes, such as with people of other sexes or other races than ourselves. “Blink” was a very complicated book with many facets and it’s hard to explain all of them or review them all without writing an essay. In the end, I think the main goal isn’t perfect knowledge of the subject of thinking without thinking, but rather consideration of it and how it can benefit us or hinder us both individually and as a society."
94,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186516-margaret-ross,3,"I think this book wins my prize for Most Easily Misinterpreted to Serve Personal Agendas. Gladwell gets so into the interesting details of the case he's building, he really doesn't emphasize the final conclusions of the book at all, leaving people to think that the interesting details are the whole point, which is unfortunate. But then again, I'm not 100% sure I got the whole point.Most of the folks I know think that this book is about how a person's gut instincts can be a better read of a situation than a read based on thorough study. Which is an idea that most people love, since they don't want to have to do all that boring study anyhow. What's missing from that analysis is that Gladwell later insists (but only at the very end of the book, and almost in passing) that it's the thorough active training and study of a subject that allow a person to have ""true"" or ""correct"" gut reads. The guy who can tell who's getting divorced after 60 seconds of hearing them talk spent years coding verbal and physical cues in couples, studying them intensely for years before he was able to give his 60 second analysis. The art historians were drawing on a vast body of knowledge when they made their judgment about the statue. The cop who read fear instead of aggression and didn't shoot couldn't name what he was seeing, but he'd seen it before. Then he also says that our gut reactions can be easily colored by training we don't even know is there- our prejudices, whether unknown or unacknowledged- influence or reads of a situation as well.Ultimately, I saw this book as a reaction to and analysis of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, with some tips for how to avoid such future tragedies. In that light, I thought it was interesting and even constructive, but only if you pay close attention to the last chapter. "

Paul Getty Museum in California. It was thought by many experts to be legitimate, but when others first looked at it, their initial responses were skeptical.

1983میلادی، یک دلال آثار هنری به نام جیان فرانکو به چینا به موزه پاول گتی کالیفرنیا مراجعه کرد؛ او ادعا میکرد مجسمه مرمرینی در اختیار دارد که متعلق به شش قرن پیش از میلاد است؛ این مجسمه معروف به کورس بود ـ مجسمه ای از یک مرد جوان برهنه ایستاده با دستانی از دوطرف آویخته و پای چپ جلو نهاده؛ تا آن زمان در حدود دویست مجسمه کورسی از حفاریهای باستانشناسی یا گورهای قدیمی به دست آمده بود که اغلب آنها در هنگام اکتشاف یا متلاشی شده بودند و یا بدجوری آسیب دیده بودند، اما این یکی تقریبا سالم مانده بود؛ ارتفاع این مجسمه نزدیک به دومتر و بیست و پنج سانتیمتر بود و شفافیتی داشت که آن را از بقیه مجسمه های اکتشافی متمایز میکرد؛ این یک کشف خارق العاده بود و مبلغ پیشنهادی به چینا زیر ده میلیون دلار بود؛ موزه گتی با احتیاط وارد عمل شد؛ مجسمه کورس را به امانت گرفت و تحقیق دقیقی را شروع کرد؛ آیا مجسمه با بقیه مجسمه های کورسی همخوانی داشت؟ جواب به ظاهر آری بود؛ شیوه ی ساخت آن به نظر مشابه مجسمه کورس آناویسوس در موزه ملی باستان شناسی آتن بود، و معنایش این بود که با زمان و مکان خاصی مطابقت داشت؛ این مجسمه از کجا و چه زمانی پیدا شده بود؟ هیچکس به طور دقیق نمیدانست؛ اما به چینا مدارکی به اداره حقوقی موزه گتی ارائه داد که حاوی تاریخچه اخیر آن بود؛ طبق مدارک موجود، کورس از سال 1930میلادی در کلکسیون خصوصی یک پزشک سوییسی به نام لوفن برگر نگهداری میشد، که خود او نیز آن را از دلال معروف آثار هنری یونانی به نام روسس خریده بود؛ برای بررسیهای دقیق، زمین شناسی به نام استنلی مارگولیس از دانشگاه کالیفرنیا به موزه آمد و به مدت دو روز سطح مجسمه را با یک استریو میکروسکوپ بسیار حساس مورد آزمایش قرار داد و بعد از زیر زانوی راست مجسمه تکه ای به قطر یک سانتیمتر و طول دو سانتیمتر جدا کرد و با استفاده از میکروسکوپ الکترونی، اشعه انکساری ایکس و اشعه فلورسنسی ایکس به تجزیه آن پرداختمارگولیس به این نتیجه رسید که مجسمه از سنگ مرمر دُلومیت معدن قدیمی کیپ وتی در جزیره تاسوس ساخته شده، و سطح مجسمه با لایه نازکی از کربنات آهک پوشیده شده است ــ که به گفته وی از اهمیت خاصی برخوردار بود ــ زیرا دُلومیت تنها در طول قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند تبدیل به کربنات آهک شود؛ به عبارت دیگر مجسمه شیئی قدیمی بود و تقلبی نبودموزه گتی از این مسئله خشنود بود، و چهارده ماه پس از شروع تحقیقات با خریدن مجسمه موافقت شد؛ در پاییز 1986میلادی مجسمه برای اولین بار به نمایش گذاشته شد؛ نیویورک تایمز حکایت آنرا در صفحه ی اول خود آورد؛ چند ماه بعد متصدی اموال عتیقه ی موزه، ماریون ترو، گزارشی پرشور و بلندبالا از دستیابی موزه به مجسمه، برای مجله برلینگتون نوشت: «اکنون کورس با قامتی برافراشته و دستانی مشت شده حیات مطمئن خویش را که برترین خصلت او و برادرانش است ابراز میکند.» و سپس پیروزمندانه نتیجه گیری کرد: «او چه خدا باشد و چه انسان تجسم کامل نیروی تابناک بلوغ هنری غرب است.»؛ با تمام این احوال مشکلی وجود داشت؛ مجسمه به نظر اصل نمیآمد، اولین کسیکه به این مشکل اشاره کرد، فردی بود به نام فدریکو زِری، مورخ هنرشناس ایتالیایی، که عضو هیئت امنای موزه نیز بود؛ وقتی «زِری» در دسامبر 1983میلادی به محل نگهداری مجسمه رفت، تا آن را ببیند، بی اختیار به ناخنهای آن خیره شد؛ البته نمیخواست توضیحی برای این مسئله بدهد، اما به نظرش یک جای کار ایراد داشت؛ نفر بعدی «اِوِلین هریسون»، یکی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی بود، که هنگام معامله نهایی، در «لس آنجلس» بود؛ او چنین به خاطر میآورد: آن زمان آرتور هافتن متصدی موزه بود، و ما را برای بازدید برد؛ او با یک حرکت پارچه روی مجسمه را پس زد و گفت، «خُب، این هنوز مال ما نیست اما تا چند هفته دیگر خواهد شد.»؛ و من گفتم: «خیلی متاسفم که این را میشنوم.»، هریسون چه دیده بود؟ خودش نمیداند؛ در همان لحظه اول، وقتی «هافتن» پارچه را کنار زده بود، آنچه «هریسون» حس کرده بود، یک الهام بود، یک احساس غریزی از اینکه چیزی آن وسط اشکال داشت؛چند ماه بعد «هافتن»، «تامس هاوینگ» مدیر سابق موزه «متروپولتین» را برای بازدید از مجسمه، به کارگاه مرمّت موزه برد؛ «هاوینگ» همیشه اولین کلمه ای را که با دیدن چیزی از ذهنش میگذرد یادداشت میکند؛ و هرگز فراموش نمیکند اولین کلمه ای که با دیدن «کورس» از ذهنش گذشت چه بود؛هاوینگ میگوید: «آن کلمه «تازه» بود ــ «تازه»، و «تازه» برای مجسمه ای که دوهزار سال قدمت دارد کلمه مناسبی نیست.»؛ «هاوینگ» بعدها که راجع به آن لحظه فکر کرد، فهمید چرا چنین کلمه ای به ذهنش خطور کرده بود: «من در سیسیلی حفاری کرده بودم، جاییکه تکه ها و قطعاتی از این دست پیدا میشوند، اما این یکی به هیچ کدام شبیه نبود؛ به نظر میرسید این مجسمه کورس از توی یکی از همین قوطیهای قهوه مرغوب استارباکس بیرون آمده باشد!» «هاوینگ» رو به «هافتن» پرسید، «آیا برای آن پولی هم پرداخته اید؟» و وقتی با چهره متعجب هافتن مواجه شد، گفت، «اگر پرداخته اید سعی کنید پس بگیرید و معامله را فسخ کنید.»؛ مسئولان موزه «گتی» کم کم داشتند نگران میشدند، بنابراین سمپوزیوم ویژه ای در مورد کورس در یونان برپا کردند؛ مجسمه را بسته بندی کردند و به یونان فرستادند، و از متخصصان ارشد مجسمه شناسی دعوت کردند؛ اینبار زمزمه یاس و دلهره بلندتر به گوش میرسید؛ «هریسون» در کنار مردی ایستاده بود که نامش «جرج دِس پینیس» بود، و رئیس موزه «آرکوپولیس آتن»؛ «جرج دس پینیس» نگاهی به کورس انداخت و رنگش پرید؛ او رو به هریسون گفت: «هر کس یکبار در عمرش مجسمه ای را که از دل خاک بیرون کشیده شده، دیده باشد میتواند تشخیص دهد، این یکی زیرزمین نبوده است.» «جورجیوس دانتاس»، رئیس جمعیت باستانشناسی آتن، به محض اینکه مجسمه را دید تنش یخ کرد؛ او گفت: «وقتی برای اولین بار کورس را دیدم احساس کردم انگار شیشه ای بین من و مجسمه کشیده شده است.»؛در سمپوزیوم، «آنجلوس دِلی وریاس» مدیر موزه «بناکی آتن» نیز گفته های «دانتاس» را تایید کرد؛ او به تفصیل از تناقض بین سبک ساخت مجسمه، و این واقعیت که مرمر آن از معادن تاسوس استخراج شده است، صحبت کرد، و سپس به اصل مطلب رسید؛ چرا او فکر میکرد که مجسمه تقلبی است؟ زیرا وقتی برای اولین بار به آن نگاه انداخته بود موجی از ادراک و دافعه ی حسی در او برانگیخته شده بود؛ زمانیکه سمپوزیوم به پایان رسید در بین اکثر مدعوین این اتفاق نظر وجود داشت، که کورس ابدا آن چیزی نیست که تصور میشدموزه گتی با تمامی متخصصان و وکلای خود و ماهها بررسی دقیق به یک نتیجه رسیده بود، و برخی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی ــ تنها با یک نگاه و احساس دافعه حسی ــ به نتیجه ای دیگر؛ حق با کدام یک بود؟ برای مدتی هیچ چیز مشخص نبود؛ کورس تبدیل به مسئله ای شده بود که متخصصان هنری در کنفرانسهای مختلف بر سر آن بحث و جدل میکردند؛ اما بعد، اندک اندک، ابهامات ماجرای گتی شروع به روشن شدن نمود؛ برای مثال نامه هایی که وکلای گتی به دقت پیگیری کرده بودند و مشخص میکرد که کورس متعلق به یک پزشک سوییسی بوده، جعلی از آب درآمد؛ یکی از نامه هایی که به تاریخ 1952میلادی بود دارای یک کدپستی بود، که تا بیست سال پس از آن تاریخ هنوز وجود خارجی نداشت؛ نامه دیگری که تاریخ 1955میلادی را داشت، به یک حساب بانکی اشاره داشت، که تا تاریخ 1963میلادی هنوز افتتاح نشده بود؛ در اصل نتیجه ی ماهها تحقیق فقط این شد که کورس موزه گتی همان سبک مجسمه آناویسوس را داشت، اما این نتیجه گیری نیز مورد شک بود؛هرچه متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی دقیقتر به آن نگاه میکردند بیشتر به التقاطی بودن آن پی میبردند؛ هر قسمت از اندام مجسمه مربوط به زمان و مکان متفاوتی بود؛ اندام باریک مرد جوان بیشتر شبیه کورس تنه آ بود که در موزه مونیخ نگهداری میشد، و موهای خوش حالتش شبیه کورس موزه متروپولتین نیویورک؛ و در این بین پاهایش چیزی نبودند جز هنر مدرن، از قضا این مجسمه از همه بیشتر شبیه مجسمه شکسته و کوچکتری بود که در سال 1990میلادی، توسط یک هنرشناس بریتانیایی در سوییس پیدا شده بود؛ هر دو مجسمه از یک سنگ مرمر مشابه و با یک سبک تراشیده شده بود؛ اما کورس سوییسی متعلق به گذشته نبود، بلکه در اوایل دهه هشتاد در کارگاهی در رم ساخته شده بود؛ پس تحقیقات علمی که مشخص میکرد سطح مجسمه کورس تنها پس از قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند به چنین شکلی درآید چه؟ خوب آن نتایج همچندان قطعی نبودند؛ طبق آزمایشها و بررسیهای بعدی زمینشناس دیگری به این نتیجه رسید، که با استفاده از کپک سیب زمینی، میتوان در عرض چند ماه سطح مجسمه مرمر دلومیتی را به شکل کهنه و قدیمی درآورد؛ در کاتالوگ موزه گتی تصویری از مجسمه کورس چاپ شده که زیر آن نوشته شده «حدود ۵۳۰سال قبل از میلاد، یا، مدرن جعلی.»؛ زمانیکه «فدریکو زری» و «اِوِلین هریسون» و «تامس هاوینگ» و «جورجیوس دانتاس» ــ و خیلیهای دیگر ــ با یک نگاه به مجسمه دچار دافعه حسی شدند مطمئنا حق داشتند؛ آنها در همان دو ثانیه اول ـ در یک نگاه ـ به شناختی از ماهیت مجسمه دست یافتند که تیم تخصصی موزه گتی پس از چهارده ماه تحقیق هنوز به آن نرسیده بود؛ یک نگاه کتابی است درباره ی همان دو ثانیه نخست.»؛ پایان نقلا. شربیانی"
96,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"O, to have the writing career of Malcolm Gladwell. The man pulls interesting case studies from academic research and news headlines, spins it into a book under a general theme, and blammo! He has a bestseller. This formula worked for him with The Tipping Point and then Blink. Blink is a compelling read, despite its weak overall theme, which is that sometimes split-second decisions are good and sometimes they're bad, and we need to learn when to trust our first impressions and when to discount them (except there's no real way to make that distinction). The book is a pleasure to read simply because of its case studies. Gladwell throws in so many topics — art, politics, marriage, consumer testing, athletes, war, police shootings, music — that there is bound to be something engaging for everyone. (After reading another one of Gladwell's peppy articles in The New Yorker, my husband joked, ""Gladwell thinks he can make ANYTHING seem interesting."")After finishing Blink, I feel like I've learned something important, but I'm not sure exactly what, other than that Gladwell has a very charmed career.My rating: 3.5 stars rounded up to 4"
97,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,3,"This was a big best-seller for Gladwell. He posits that much of the time we make decisions, reach conclusions in a sort of pre-conscious manner that he calls “thin-slicing.” That means taking a very small sample, a thin slice, and making a decision immediately based on that information. However, it is the case that the ability to evaluate that slice is fed by a lifetime of experience. It is not simply, as some, including President Bush the second, might believe, that using one’s gut, in the absence of years and years of preparation, is as valid a way of reaching decisions as taking the longer route of careful analysis of available data. No, no, no."
98,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"I generally distrust anyone who says that they ‘go-with-their-gut’. But when the company I work for announced a major decision a few years back, I instantly said, “This is going to be a huge mistake.” Smart people had examined the deal backwards and forwards for months and thought it was a great idea. I had a bad feeling about it that I could only later explain, and I was far from the only one. And we were right. The entire thing turned out to be a huge disaster. I kept thinking about that incident when I read Blink. The book has a pretty obvious point. People make snap decisions that they can’t consciously explain. Sometimes these decisions are correct and amazing based on the limited amount of information available. Art experts who instantly know a statue is fake despite scientific tests indicating otherwise. A fireman who appears to be fighting a routine small fire suddenly orders his men out without really knowing why and the floor collapses a second later. And sometimes these decisions can be wrong and have tragic consequences. Four cops think a guy has a gun when he’s pulling his wallet out and shoot him multiple times.We’ve all made quick decisions and later been amazed at how good or bad they turned out, but what makes Blink interesting is that Gladwell does some examination of the science behind how we arrive at these conclusions, and his thoughts on how the data we’re processing can either give us incredible insight or lead us horribly wrong.Thankfully, Gladwell is not making an argument against logical thinking or analyzing a problem. What he is doing is pointing out that instinct or intuition can be a powerful tool IF the people involved have trained themselves to make good decisions, and if we know when to trust it. He’s got a lot of great examples of doctors, military officers and police officers who often have to make life-or-death decisions in a matter of seconds with limited information. They have to trust their instincts, and Gladwell makes some common sense points that the right kind of training and education can make a huge difference. He contrasts the story of the four New York cops who killed the guy with a wallet versus a patrolman who did not fire on someone who actually had a gun but was attempting to surrender it.What made this book fun to read was the variety of examples that Gladwell uses and the scientific research done with them. Art dealers, doctors, marriage counselors, cops, military officers, car salesmen, a tennis coach, and classical musicians are all used as examples of the strengths and weaknesses of snap decisions. There’s also some simple experiments included that let you play along at home. This is a book that will make you think about the way you think."
99,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/344817-mackenzie,2,"so i bought this book in boston's logan airport about 10 minutes before i had to board a flight to seattle. the bookstore was limited; i didn't want to have to work to get interested. and the first 100 pages or so did the trick... until i realized that gladwell wasn't so much building an argument as telling stories about a certain topic. don't get me wrong, i finished the book. later. back in boston, on the T. and it did cover some interesting studies, or i wouldn't have done so. but i suspect the author might've lacked the attention span necessary to lend this book any coherence. meh. it was basically a series of loosely related tidbits about snap-judgments, none of which led me to conclude that instinct or intuition is significantly more or less reliable than rational deliberation. if a point could be gleaned and summarized, i guess it would be that with the right thin-slice of information, under the right conditions, instantaneous judgements can be spot-on. shrug. the best i can say about this book is that there were a couple of well-set-up digs at the bush administration and i discovered the music of kenna, who's pretty cool. i also learned that when my girlfriend's eyes get even a little wider, it means she's angry."
100,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak,4,"Much like the reason behind my majoring in Economics, I like Gladwell because he opens my mind to new ideas and new ways to think. Much like Economics, I believe he's far from perfect, but I really enjoy viewing the world through his lens. In just about anything, when people start acting as if there is only one way to do something, I stop listening to them. This goes for many things, but especially politics. If you DO, however, find someone who is omniscient and knows exactly how every policy will turn out in the end, please let me know. I may listen to their one way of seeing the world. Otherwise ...What I got from Blink is that there is a lot to our instant thoughts and feelings and many times much more than we give them credit. The traditional wisdom is to plan and make huge weighty decisions based on every single bit of information that we have at our fingertips (which is just about everything, google!). This is actually a big reason my wife and I get into ... disagreements (we'll go with that). She likes to plan everything down to the last detail and I like to be a bit more relaxed.So it would seem that this book is a big proponent of my way of doing things, but it turns out it's not so much.We should trust our gut-instinct, says Blink, if we have many hours of experience in said realm of understanding because we have developed the skills to make sense of those small details and because we have the ability to ""thin slice."" Gladwell also makes the point that not always can we trust our gut-intinct, however, because our gut-instinct tends to be racist, even when we are not in fact consciously racist. Also, our instincts can get overwhelmed by heightened arousal, such as when people can't even dial 911 in an emergency because their senses are overloaded.But then again, you can practice and have these types of unconscious reactions mitigated.The interesting story-telling style of introducing these topics is, of course, what really gets me. It's the stories that are often unbelievable that have me clamoring for more, just like in Outliers (although I think Outliers was a little better written) and I would assume his other books. He goes into why The Getty art museum spent millions on a fake kouros (Greek statue) and why cops probably aren't racial profiling when they beat people like Rodney King, but because of a few key mistakes such as allowing their unconscious to get overwhelmed and also because they were a group of officers instead of just one.He talks about people who can listen to a couple and tell when they should start talking to their lawyers and people who have developed the actual abilities that are shown in the TV show ""Lie to Me."" How looking at a person's room for 5 minutes may give a complete stranger a better picture of a person than a good friend. I've always loved these types of explanations for things. There's the old wisdom we have and the wisdom we assume when we don't have any other way to describe a particular event and which is completely wrong. I love thinking new ideas, even when it's old news and that's why I'll keep coming back to Gladwell."
101,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"Elsewhere, in one of my other recent reviews, a GoodReads friend (Richard) told me that he had become less infatuated with this book after reading a review by a specialist in the field who gave it a drubbing. I was worried that knowing this might ruin this book for me – but it has not. I really enjoyed this one too. This is the third of Gladwell’s books I’ve read in quick succession and this contained lots of information about things that have made me think and sparked my interest to learn more. It may well be that Gladwell’s style does not appeal to an expert in the field – and that is quite likely to be true, but I’ve found that it is often the case that I’ve been introduced to themes by popularisers and later went on to read more deeply on a subject. I rarely condemn those who introduce me to fascinating topics – and this is a fascinating topic.I’m not going to do a full review, but rather quickly talk about wine. While he was talking about coke and about taste tests I was thinking about wine. He makes the point that when asked to judge jam people do nearly as well as the experts if they are just asked which jam they liked the most, but do much worse than experts if asked to explain why they graded them in the order that they did. That is, if they have to talk about texture and sweetness and citrus flavours – people change how they judge jam and end up picking the worst jam rather than the best. This is because we don’t really know what ‘texture’ is and so trying to slot jams into categories that we don’t really understand means we are most likely to stuff up and confuse ourselves. Now, wine. I wonder if anyone has ever done a test at cellar doors to see what people end up buying and if they pick the nicest wine for the price, or do they buy vinegar instead? I wouldn’t mind betting that there would be something similar happening here – and if you are with someone who says things like, “Oh yes, fruity, but with a back-taste of coal tar” you might end up buying something that is quite disgusting. You know, unless you actually have some idea of what you are talking about, it might be best to shut up and drink the wine.That is the point of this book – learning when to trust your “immediate reactions” and when to question them. I think there is much in this book that is worth knowing and much that is fascinatingly interesting. (The stuff about unconscious racism is so important that everyone should be forced to read this for that alone). But with Richard, I am a little concerned that an expert in the field didn't like this book. All the same, the expert does recommend Made to Stick so I guess that can be the next book I read.There is – as is proven by Dylan Moran – only one way to pick wine:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2gGf..."
102,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,4,"I reread this after realizing I couldn't remember enough to compare with Kahneman`s book. They are mostly aligning, only Kahneman suggests against making snap judgements and relying more on evidence whereas Gladwell gives views from both sides and stays impartial.Blink is about unconscious decision making. Our unconscious side is fascinating, because it seems to be the one that holds the strings most of the time; making very fast decisions, watching out for any threat to our existence. However when our drives (the motivators of unconscious) are in conflict, ourrational mind is quick to get in. The rational mind is also there to make corrections, and making plans. So it seems that mostly we are on autopilot for unimportant things, and also when we have to do something at lightening speed. But at other times even if there is an urge to act instinctively, one should act relying on data rather than on instinct."
103,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,"Probably the best among Gladwell's books. He still stands true to his success mantra - ""Gladwell - The Power of Inductive Reasoning."" But, it was still a well researched and informative book. Blink."
104,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048682-karin,3,"3.4 starsMy interest in this book varied by chapter--by far the best one for me was ""Seven Seconds in the Bronx"" in part because I have a child with a diagnosis on the ""spectrum"" and in part because it answered my question as to why I now see police officers cruising by themselves (this is for an excellent reason, it turns out, but no spoilers as to why!) While I enjoyed The Tipping Point more, I have to say that I am happy to have read this after that particular chapter. This is not to say it's the only one I found interesting, because at least one other one was quite fascinating for me.I do plan to read more books by Gladwell in the future."
105,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1090620-ed,2,"I didn't learn much from this book that I did not already know. I am beginning to suspect that Malcolm Gladwell is not writing books that uncover valuable facts that we should know, but rather is writing books that restate facts we already know but in an interesting way.I like his anecdotal stories very much which is why I finished the book - hoping for more stories. When he lays out the facts, though, his writing is no more interesting than any other scientific author. So, in summary, what we have is a talented writer making certain scientific findings available to a much wider audience than usual. Bravo! However if you want to learn something new, this book or his previous effort, The Tipping Point, is not where to go to find it. I imagine, if I read it, I will find The Outliers, his latest effort, to be similarly constructed.Blink's content is easily summarized. First impressions are often more accurate than conclusions arrived at after much study and analysis. Be careful, though, because first impressions can be troublesome because of people's prejudices. Got it in 254 pages. He does come up with an interesting term, ""thin slicing"", to describe the process of taking in a first impression. Maybe learning that term made reading the whole book worthwhile. Maybe."
106,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"A really great study on how important the first few seconds of anything can be, in any particular situation. Be it that you're an art expert who instantly knows an object is fake, or a police man who thinks that the victim is pulling a gun out of their pocket rather than a wallet, it's very clear that human beings do have this constant auto-pilot running, an unconscious ""survival mode"" that gives us most of the clues we might need in the ""blink"" of an eye, and sometimes those clues might be wrong."
107,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"Gladwell continues his exploration of counter-intuitive ideas about decision-making in BLINK! He opens with a 1983 incident at the J. Paul Getty Museum. The Museum acquired a rare statue from the Greek archaic period. To this day, the Museum maintains that the authenticity of the statue is uncertain. At the time, however, the Museum was certain enough to acquire the piece for just under $10 million. Documentation, and scientific analysis had been relied on as support. However, numerous experts including Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas Hoving pronounced it a fake. It was an intuitive pronouncement which presaged problems later uncovered with both the documentation and scientific analysis. This is the first of many stories Gladwell uses to illustrate how an intuitive reaction can trump logic and analysis.Among the factors that cloud logic is something he calls the adaptive unconscious. It's an unrecognized emotional bias. In the Getty example, the officials wanted the piece to be authentic. It would have been a spectacular acquisition for a newly established museum. This desire diverted critical scrutiny of the supporting evidence. Such an adaptation need not even be emotion based. In an explanation of priming, Gladwell cites psychological studies that illustrate the subconscious effect of pre-conditioning through word lists. Extrapolating from these examples, one might conclude that the casual reader will be highly influenced when reviewing a book by his mood or even surroundings at the time of reading.Gladwell explores other impediments to logical thinking, logic being a type of perceptual filter. Face recognition, he points out, occurs in a completely different part of the brain, and is an integrated reaction as opposed to the kind of multi-step processing that occurs in dealing with language. Athletic and musical achievement rely on these non-verbal neural processes. His own example cites Paul Van Ripper's success against a team backed by the Pentagon's most sophisticated computers in a war games exercise. The Pentagon team was actually hampered in their decision making by information overload. Initial reaction, Gladwell points out is not always accurate. He tries to explore this downside as well by citing studies on bias. Gladwell is an entertaining storyteller as well as an energetic researcher. He draws examples from market research, Chancellorsville in the Civil War, the assessment of heart attacks at Cook County Hospital, speed dating, fire fighting, the auditioning of professional musicians, and the Diallo Incident in the Bronx to illustrate his points. By drawing from such a wide variety of experience, he insures the interest of a broad audience in this book. NOTE: It's always fun to re-encounter characters from other books. I knew of Thomas Hoving from his book, KING OF THE CONFESSORS. The idea of thin-slice thinking was also explored in HOW WE DECIDE, by Jonah Lehrer. The deconstruction of flavor is discussed from a neurophysiological standpoint in Gordon Shepherd's NEUROGASTRONOMY. "

It also said 48% of test-takers have a ""Strong automatic preference for White people"" - crazy! - I loved the bit about President Warren Harding (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_H...), who - according to the author, basically got elected because he ""looked presidential"". I firmly believe looks matter - hey after all I do live in CA where we have the Governator..."
109,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,2,"I was really expecting more from this book. I've heard mostly good things about Gladwell, and he had a pretty interesting TED talk, and I enjoy almost anything to do with the brain, so...why not?The book certainly brought up a lot of interesting ideas and did a good job of discussing the different elements that go into the snap decisions that we make every day. And it's probably worth a read for many of the stories and experiments related. But for the most part this book really failed to impress. More than that though, it failed at being a coherent analysis of what goes on in the human brain when we make snap judgments. Gladwell alternates between telling us to trust and accept this ""mysterious phenomena"" that allows us to make these unconscious snap judgments and warning us against the use of these snap judgments. One moment he advises against the idea that we need to slowly collect data and weigh options to make the most informed opinion and provides examples where too much thinking and information leads us astray, and in the next moment gives us examples of how snap judgments sometimes go horribly wrong. And he leaves us with no clear sense of how to use this new found information to make better decisions and judgments in our own lives. Do I trust my insights because my rational brain will fool me, or do I mistrust my instincts because of the inherent bias contained within them? If Gladwell knows he sure didn't tell me.One example of somewhere where I think he didn't analyze the situation enough was when he talked about the Wisconsin Card Sorting task (pick cards from one of two decks, one deck tends towards bad and the other towards good outcomes). He focused solely on how the unconscious mind was aware of the pattern (which deck was bad and which was good) long before the conscious mind was aware of it when making decisions. And this was shown by the fact that sweating occurred when choosing from the ""bad"" deck before the subject knew why (or was even aware of it). What he fails to mention about all this is that the reason for this is because we are designed to be ""risk averse"". It is not because we are making brilliant snap judgments, or that our brains have ""learned"" the rules before we are aware of it. From an evolutionary perspective it pays off more to learn from our mistakes than learn from our victories. Mistakes are costly. This is why bad memories are more salient than happy ones. The sweating that occurs is a physiological indicator of and means of prompting the organism to stay away. It's not even that this explanation is in contradiction to Gladwell's; it is that it IS an explanation for the phenomena Gladwell describes, one easily at Gladwells' disposal. Two other aspects of this book stuck out as major frustrations for me:1) Gladwell spends a lot of time early on talking about the mysterious nature of our ability to thin slice (make accurate snap judgments based on very little information) and urges us to accept this. To his credit, he does attempt to demystify this somewhat later on, but not enough in my opinion. His first example is of a museum that purchased an expensive sculpture which all the data and scientists evaluated as legitimate, but which experts in the field immediately saw as a fake without being able to put into words why. It's purposefully misleading to label this as some sort of mysterious phenomena. For instance, it's important to remember that these people were experts. An amateur would not and could not make this same snap judgment because they don't have the training to. This ability didn't magically appear, it came from learning and training and synaptic change. These experts learned over time. They studied types of stone, and different styles, and everything else that goes into understanding their field. And this process created memories...synaptic change within their brains. And there exists a system (or systems) in the brain that can make decisions based on that neuronal structure without conscious awareness. Shortcuts so to speak. But these shortcuts are a product of that neuronal structure, which is a product of that synaptic change, which is a product of the learning the individual did over time. It's misleading to call this mysterious. What's important, and more interesting in my opinion, is figuring out the underlying processes that allow this to happen. 2) Towards the end of the book Gladwell discusses how our stress response leads us to make all sorts of bad decisions. He talks about autism and how autistic people can't mind read (don't have theories of other minds) and how this affects their interpretation of events around them and of the world in general. He compares what happens to people in stressful situations to this, that during these situations, because the fight or flight response has taken over, people have tunnel vision and can no longer ""read minds"" and thus make all sorts of mistakes and bad decisions because they are focusing on the wrong things. My issue is that he, incomprehensibly, makes a literal, as opposed to metaphorical, connection with autism. He argues that during these times we become ""temporarily autistic"". While it's true that one aspect of our behavior becomes similar to an aspect of an autistic individuals behavior during these times, it seems like a pretty ridiculous statement to make as a broad generalization. He spends quite a bit of time talking about this and I don't think it does anyone any good.In the end I think I was most disappointed by the fact that all the elements to create a good book WERE present here, and the failure is due in large part to how he puts it all together and his ability to analyze all the disparate ideas properly (insert irony here). Evolution has built into us shortcuts to react quickly to stimuli in our environment. Our experience, whether broadly cultural or personal, prunes, enhances, changes those built in shortcuts as we go through life. Some develop as unfair biases towards people of different races. Some develop as we become experts in a subject. Thus some can be trusted and some can't. Our brains can't tell the difference between fact and fiction, only between experience and non experience, and so it's important to be aware of what kind of decision making goes on under the surface and what factors are involved in those decisions so we can be more aware of whether to trust them or not. Other factors can affect decision making, such as our emotional state due to the physiological changes that take place during those times, and this too is important to understand because it radically alters our perception during those times. The most important thing to remember is that experience translates into instinct through synaptic change, and through work and training we can increase the effectiveness of our gut reactions and snap decisions, but due to biases and our altered states during emotional situations those instincts should not always be trusted outright. There you go Malcolm Gladwell, please feel free to use this in the next printing. No citation necessary. "
110,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Malcolm Gladwell engagingly writes about how decisions made in a blink--snap judgments--can be very good. A series of entertaining anecdotes and psychological studies show that first impressions can be good in some cases, especially in areas where people have experience. He also writes about experts who analyze facial expressions, and how autistic people have trouble making certain types of judgment calls.But then he goes on to show how our unconscious mind can also be very prejudiced. Tall men are more likely to become CEOs than short men. Using Warren Harding as an example, he shows that people may vote for a political candidate because they look presidential. Women are less likely to be offered positions in some orchestras unless the auditions are held with the competitors behind a screen, so they are just evaluated on their playing ability. He also includes stories about police officers making snap judgments, and the judicial system handing out longer sentences to minorities. There were some examples that supported decisions made quickly by the subconscious level, and other examples that showed certain decisions were better when we slowed down and consciously gave things a little more thought. Experience played a big part in having good judgment making quick decisions. Gladwell does not get into how the brain works in making decisions. The book is interesting and entertaining, but it raises as many questions as it answers. 3.5 stars."

Even as a general reader, I find this book says a lot of things but does not actually tell you what it actually wants to address. But I love this book for totally different reasons. Firstly, I love case studies with interesting results written by someone who can write in a way you will find the whole experience exhilarating. Secondly, this guy deserves a five star because he is making less known but thought-provoking scientific studies to a much wider audience. Thirdly, nowhere it is mentioned in the title it is a book which teaches you how to think without thinking so it is completely understandable why it shows us both the advantages and disadvantages of snap decision making and it completely leaves to the reader to decide when to do what. Finally, I love non-fiction which uses a lot of anecdotes to state a fact rather just directly stating the fact it wants to address. I recommend it to anyone who loves to read about interesting psychological studies. "

113,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/337591-zinta,5,"Where does it all go, after you are done experiencing the experience, thinking the thought, feeling the feeling? Nothing is ever lost. The subconscious is like a vast warehouse, limitless, in fact, and as Malcolm Gladwell illustrates in Blink, we access all that is stored in that warehouse with every blinking and waking moment.Usually, we call this instant access - gut instinct. Or, the inner voice of wisdom. Instinct, however, is nothing magical or mysterious. It is simply our accumulated and stored knowledge over a lifetime. If there was ever an argument for listening to those who have some serious and well-lived years under their belts, this is it. Blink illustrates with numerous and widely varied examples how life experience, the more the better, contributes to our ability to make quick, yet sound decisions. In fact, the quicker, the better.Blink is about what the author calls ""thin slicing."" He defines this process as the moment of time in which we all make snap judgments. Two seconds, two minutes ... and we make an assessment of a situation or a person or a circumstance. The fascinating thing is - these snap judgments are, more often than not, precise ones. It is when we begin to over analyze and rationalize that we tend to go awry. The trick is to allow the accumulated wisdom rise up and do its magic, trust in it.Then again ...Gladwell never does make a concluding statement in his book, and perhaps it is up to the reader to decide (do it quickly?), but his many fascinating examples and his reports on various studies can lead one to think these snap judgments are the way to go - or, then again, thinker beware. For all the many situations in which that moment of initial wisdom is uncannily precise, there are other times that our deeply ingrained biases muck up the clarity of that process. Gladwell cites data to illustrate how stereotypes, for instance, persist - no matter how gallant our conscious efforts to overcome them. Telling yourself you don't really think what you think simply won't work. Only exposure to experiences, or positive visualizations, will change the false ideas and images our subconscious has absorbed over time. All of which is a strong argument for ""garbage in, garbage out."" That is, be careful of what entertainment you choose (e.g. pornographic images, violent movies or games, etc.), because no matter how hard your conscious mind tries to guide you toward decisions and behavior that is more appropriate, your subconscious will always, but always win out.The idea of what you present to your eye is what you will later project out to the world is a convincing one, as the author finds himself unable to beat the test on stereotypes when he has to react quickly. Only exposure to more positive images over time can change his test results and dislodge his prejudices.Gladwell discusses this phenomena of instant response-true response in a manner of ways. How patients respond to their doctors (we sue the physician who has a lousy bedside manner, even if more skilled, but remain loyal to the physician who spends as little as three extra minutes talking with us); how facial expressions, when viewed on slowed down video, will without fail, always reveal deceit (there are facial movements that arise from our subconscious that we cannot control, and no matter how quickly we think we have our facial mask in place, there is always that instant that our faces tell the truth); the intricacies of marketing and advertisement and why the obvious ad, even when based on feedback of focus groups, may not be the effective choice; how military decisions by experienced military leaders are successful, but fail miserably when they are constrained by strategic analysis; how micro-managing in workplaces can only lead to mediocrity while suppressing creativity and innovation; how speed dating may be most effective in finding potential lifelong connections (we read about research that can pick out successful, longterm relationships in observing as little as two minutes of interaction between a couple - and no, it isn't the couple that argues that breaks apart); how our societal subconscious biases for certain physical characteristics, such as height or gender, often mislead us to make dangerously faulty snap judgments (Gladwell observes that most of our leaders are tall and male, and that our corporate world pays tall men higher salaries, factoring dollars down to the inch, regardless of intelligence or ability). On and on, in one fascinating example and study after another, Gladwell intrigues with his findings.And you know he's right. You know it ... in your gut. But if the author doesn't make any overall conclusion from all of this fascinating data, then the reader is left to her own wiles. Experience counts more than credentials. What we expose ourselves to on a regular basis molds who we are, how we view others, what choices we make and how we behave. Biases and prejudices are far stronger than our conscious will to overcome them; we must align our environment to align our subconscious. Our deepest self forgets nothing. All we have ever done and been and seen and observed leads to who we are today and tomorrow.All of which gives one pause. But don't pause too long. It is that initial millisecond that may matter most of all."

One of the most important of the rules that make improv possible, for examples is the idea of agreement, the notion that a very simple way to create a story—or humor—is to have characters accept everything that happens to them. Good improvisors seem telepathic; everything looks pre-arranged. This is because they accept all offers made—which is something no normal person would do.Neither Masten nor Rhea believes that clever packaging allows a company to put out a bad-tasting product. The taste of the product itself matters a great deal. Their point is simply that when we put something in our mouth and in that blink of an eye decide whether it tastes good or not, we are reacting not only to the evidence from our taste buds and salivary glands but also to the evidence of our eyes and memories and imaginations, and it is foolish of company to service one dimension and ignore the other.Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process. Silvan Tomkins one began a lecture by bellowing, ""The face is like a penis!"" What he meant was that the face has, to a large extent, a mind of its own.Imagine if there were a switch that all of us had, to turn off the expressions on our face at will. If babies had that switch, we wouldn't know what they were feeling. They'd be in trouble. You could make an argument, if you wanted to, that the system evolved so that parents would be able to take care of kids.People with autism...have difficulty interpreting non-verbal cues, such as gestures and facial expressions...in anything less than a perfectly literal environment, the autistic person is lost.In the interviews with police officers who have been involved with shootings, these same details appear again and again: extreme visual clarity, tunnel vision, diminished sound, and the sense that time is slowing down. This is how the human body reacts to extreme stress, and it makes sense. Our mind, faced with a life-threatening situation, drastically limits the range and amount of information that we have to deal with. Sound and memory and broader social understanding are sacrificed in favor of heightened awareness of the threat directly in front of us."

We make split-second judgements. Some people more accurately than others. This does not always mean what we think it means.Okay....I guess when the subtitle of a book has the words ""power"" and ""thinking"" in it (""The Power of Thinking Without Thinking""), I expect to gain something from it. Instead I feel like the author explains all the reasons why we should not be relying on snap judgements, despite the fact that some of the time, they are right. I don't find ""some"" to be very useful. If a person can't rely on first impressions, or what the author refers to as ""thin slice"" representations of performance or taste, what good is there in talking about it at all?Then I started thinking about why I read this book in the first place. When the new president of the university where I work started, he talked extensively about Malcolm Gladwell. He referenced this book as well as Outliers. I felt like if I read them, I would understand where he was coming from, and some of the changes he has been making. I have to admit that knowing how much of a decision people make in that first moment could have an impact on how a place is marketed. Even if first impressions don't necessarily become our opinions later on, they still have the power to make a decision in a person's mind, for better or for worse. Still, I'm not sure how you can make that work for you. Is it better to be super-sweet Pepsi that people prefer at the first sip, or more popular Coca-Cola which people are more likely to drink an entire bottle/can of, and make a repeat purchase of? I'd rather be Coke. Can you manufacture enough of a Pepsi experience and then also be Coke? That sounds dangerous to me, because I'm not sure you can be both.""People are ignorant of the things that affect their actions, yet they rarely feel ignorant. We need to accept our ignorance and say 'I don't know' more often.""""How good people's decisions are under the fast-moving, high-stress conditions of rapid cognition is a function of training and rules and rehearsal.""Gladwell does seem to be saying that if you understand the limitations of snap-judgments, you can train yourself to try to lessen bias, prejudice, and incorrect assumptions. It seems to me that the bigger trick is understanding when and how you are doing this to begin with. Write me a book about how to do that, Mr. Gladwell."
116,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/622323-snezan,4,"This work is worth a read, if not more than one. I hesitate to say too much, since I believe the conclusions it reaches are explored in the very beginning and will immediately inform the reader of its relevance. I don't know why that came out so long winded, the reader will find out how interested they are by the first or second chapter.I found the book fascinating for its close look into social interactions, particularly between two people, and for explaining why i sometimes I think the way that I do. The intuitive process of understanding is one that has made a lot of sense to me, and I am glad this book takes a microscope to that underpinning of society's operation. The examples in the book are relevant, timely and buttress the argument well. Especially the story about the psychologist that has a 90 percent success rate of whether a relationship would last past 7 years. The author's decision to skip a little exposition on detractors from the intuitive system of problem solving was a little disappointing, although I do understand that Blink is not, nor pretends to be a scholarly work. Instead it purports to be a lighthouse for a part of our decision-making that is often ignored in society and stays hidden from our conscious understanding. We often don't know why we like or dislike someone the way we do, and yet we allow that judgment to affect our interaction extremely or waffle endlessly over trying to deny or prove our first impression. How many times do you remember saying "" really wanted to like that,"" that being a dress or a person or a book and how much time has it wasted. Or why it sometimes take only a moment for a person to decide whether or not an idea has merit. Gladwell explores those snap judgments in details, and writes in a readable, approachable way. He is not afraid to tackle some controversial topics."
117,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6940509-hannah,1,"1 Star - Horrible book.Against my better judgement I gave another one of Malcolm Gladwell's books a try. Oh, what precious reading time I wasted on this book! My feelings on this book are quite similar to how I felt about The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (my review) so I'll keep this review short. My first thought after finishing this was: did I really just read 200+ pages on what is essentially the good and bad of gut reactions? There was nothing new for me here and that may not entirely be Gladwell's fault but nevertheless I could not enjoy this book. In addition to my lack of interest in the subject matter, I cannot enjoy the author's writing style. I feel he meanders and that there are so many unfinished thoughts and ideas. It drove me crazy!By the end of the book I was frustrated and upset. I recommend this book to no one. "
118,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15355957-rohit-enghakat,3,"Blink is an interesting read. The book is about making decisions in the blink of an eye, to be precise. The author says that decisions which are made instantly are far more fruitful than those made with long drawn research and logical thinking. He cites many examples which are also interesting to read. For example, the description of the Amadou Diallo incident where police officers shot an unarmed black immigrant in New York with forty-one bullets was stunning. Equally interesting was the last example of Abbie Connant playing the trombone traditionally played by a male in the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra.However, somehow the theory did not appeal to me. It is almost akin to relying on sixth sense, although the author tries to prove this scientifically. The book might appeal more to psychologists or psychiatrists. "

120,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174974-matt-kosinski,2,"Here's Blink in a nutshell:Split decisions can be good; better than decisions where we take a lot of time to carefully weigh our options and use scientific evidence. Except when they're not.Rapid cognition is an exciting and powerful way to use your brain's quick, intuitive capabilities to make stunningly accurate decisions, and can even lead you to have better success in sports, business and politics. Except when it won't.We should learn to trust our snap judgments, even in seemingly complex situations where we don't have a lot of information.Except not really.Basically the book gives scientific and anecdotal evidence on why rapid cognition can be both a good and bad thing, without offering us much advise on how to tell the difference between situations where we should or shouldn't trust our instincts. There are many times when I felt that Gladwell contradicted himself. To support his ""rapid cognition is good"" section of the book, he uses an example of a psychological test where students were able to tell whether or not a professor was good at their job by simply watching a 5 second clip of them lecturing with the sound turned off. The results basically corresponded with impressions given by other students who spent an entire class with those professors - thus proving that there is some mysterious and powerful part of our subconscious that can make accurate snap judgments.But then later on in the book, in the ""rapid cognition is bad"" section, Gladwell warns us that, in general, people instantly like tall, attractive white people better than short, unattractive minorities.WELL DUH! OBVIOUSLY THE STUDENTS RATING THE PROFESSORS WERE BIASED BY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE TALL, WHITE, OR ATTRACTIVE! Mystery solved!While Gladwell brings up some interesting concepts, his book never gels into a coherent whole. I read most of it in under a day and already my rapid cognition is telling me it's not worth finishing."
121,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72368-doc-opp,1,"As an empirical psychologist by training, I get very annoyed at journalists who simplify things to the point that its no longer even remotely accurate. Such is the case for Blink. This is especially annoying to me, because the book describes my area of research specialization. If you're interested in a fun read, Gladwell is certainly an engaging author. If you're looking for something that accurately describes the research, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. For example, Scott Plous's ""the psychology of judgment and decision making"" (which, despite the title, is not textbook like), or the Heath brothers' ""Made to stick"". "

Blink
 is- what all the stories, case studies, and arguments add up to- an attempt to understand the magical and mysterious thing called Judgement. Its basic premise is: split second decisions (snap judgements); how they can be good and bad. Gladwell suggests split-seconds decisions are better than the decisions where we take considerable time to weigh our choices and options. He points out that our mind figure things, people, et al. in a blink of an eye. And it is often that these snap judgements are much more trustworthy than judgements arrived at rationally. But he does not stop here and goes on further: snap judgements can be misleading, too; he termed it Warren Harding error. He suggested that there are some instinctive processes that prevent us to see clearly; and hence cloud our judgements. Blink is an interesting read. It is very well written, and at the same time engages your attention from the start. And writing is reader friendly, perfectly suitable for a layman..................................................I bought this book because I was intrigued by the subtitle of the book: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking. This subtitle was something Zen like, I felt. And when I read it initially, three years ago, I found it resembling with Zen teachings (and koans). Following are two quotes that mainly convey the spirit: ""They were so focused on the mechanics and the process that they never looked at the problem holistically. In the act of tearing something apart, you lose its meaning.""""When making a decision of minor importance its advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital matters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the decision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life , we should be governed by the deep inner needs of our nature."""
123,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/546634-ashley,5,"I would put this book in the category of ""Freakonomics"" and ""The Tipping Point."" By the same author as the latter title, Malcolm Gladwell, the purpose of this book is to weigh the advantages as well as the disadvantages of the power of the mind's ability to unconsciously leap to conclusions based on what is seen in the proverbial blink of an eye. While I have read some negative reviews of Gladwell's book, mostly citing that he fails to inform the reader how to know when to go with your gut and when not to, as well as arguments that he urges readers not to follow their gut when the gut instincts are politically incorrect, I have to disagree with many of them. I think that Gladwell's objective in ""Blink"" is to make the reader simply aware of their gut instincts and to urge them to consider trusting it more frequently than we do. People tend to make decisions that are supported by a litany of rationalizations and explanations, but do we always really have reasons for why we do or think what we do? Gladwell is arguing that we don’t, and that sometimes it takes the unconscious mind to make those decisions for us. On the flip side, he also argues that sometimes we unconsciously make negative decisions based on that same quick judgment and our predetermined stereotypes, such as with people of other sexes or other races than ourselves. “Blink” was a very complicated book with many facets and it’s hard to explain all of them or review them all without writing an essay. In the end, I think the main goal isn’t perfect knowledge of the subject of thinking without thinking, but rather consideration of it and how it can benefit us or hinder us both individually and as a society."
124,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186516-margaret-ross,3,"I think this book wins my prize for Most Easily Misinterpreted to Serve Personal Agendas. Gladwell gets so into the interesting details of the case he's building, he really doesn't emphasize the final conclusions of the book at all, leaving people to think that the interesting details are the whole point, which is unfortunate. But then again, I'm not 100% sure I got the whole point.Most of the folks I know think that this book is about how a person's gut instincts can be a better read of a situation than a read based on thorough study. Which is an idea that most people love, since they don't want to have to do all that boring study anyhow. What's missing from that analysis is that Gladwell later insists (but only at the very end of the book, and almost in passing) that it's the thorough active training and study of a subject that allow a person to have ""true"" or ""correct"" gut reads. The guy who can tell who's getting divorced after 60 seconds of hearing them talk spent years coding verbal and physical cues in couples, studying them intensely for years before he was able to give his 60 second analysis. The art historians were drawing on a vast body of knowledge when they made their judgment about the statue. The cop who read fear instead of aggression and didn't shoot couldn't name what he was seeing, but he'd seen it before. Then he also says that our gut reactions can be easily colored by training we don't even know is there- our prejudices, whether unknown or unacknowledged- influence or reads of a situation as well.Ultimately, I saw this book as a reaction to and analysis of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, with some tips for how to avoid such future tragedies. In that light, I thought it was interesting and even constructive, but only if you pay close attention to the last chapter. "

The book begins with the story of the Getty Kouros (Archaic Greek sculptors reduced human anatomy and musculature in these statues to decorative patterning on the surface of the marble.), which was a statue brought to the J. Paul Getty Museum in California. It was thought by many experts to be legitimate, but when others first looked at it, their initial responses were skeptical. For example, George Despinis, head of the Acropolis Museum in Athens, said ""Anyone who has ever seen a sculpture coming out of the ground could tell that thing has never been in the ground"".عنوانها:

در حالی‌که عده‌ ای دیگر، در اشتباه، دست‌ و پا می‌زنند؟ مغز ما واقعا در اداره، در کلاس، در آشپزخانه، و در خانه، چگونه کار می‌کند؟ و چرا اغلب بهترین تصمیمات، آن‌هایی هستند که توضیحشان برای دیگران،

1983میلادی، یک دلال آثار هنری به نام جیان فرانکو به چینا به موزه پاول گتی کالیفرنیا مراجعه کرد؛ او ادعا میکرد مجسمه مرمرینی در اختیار دارد که متعلق به شش قرن پیش از میلاد است؛ این مجسمه معروف به کورس بود ـ مجسمه ای از یک مرد جوان برهنه ایستاده با دستانی از دوطرف آویخته و پای چپ جلو نهاده؛ تا آن زمان در حدود دویست مجسمه کورسی از حفاریهای باستانشناسی یا گورهای قدیمی به دست آمده بود که اغلب آنها در هنگام اکتشاف یا متلاشی شده بودند و یا بدجوری آسیب دیده بودند، اما این یکی تقریبا سالم مانده بود؛ ارتفاع این مجسمه نزدیک به دومتر و بیست و پنج سانتیمتر بود و شفافیتی داشت که آن را از بقیه مجسمه های اکتشافی متمایز میکرد؛ این یک کشف خارق العاده بود و مبلغ پیشنهادی به چینا زیر ده میلیون دلار بود؛ موزه گتی با احتیاط وارد عمل شد؛ مجسمه کورس را به امانت گرفت و تحقیق دقیقی را شروع کرد؛ آیا مجسمه با بقیه مجسمه های کورسی همخوانی داشت؟ جواب به ظاهر آری بود؛ شیوه ی ساخت آن به نظر مشابه مجسمه کورس آناویسوس در موزه ملی باستان شناسی آتن بود، و معنایش این بود که با زمان و مکان خاصی مطابقت داشت؛ این مجسمه از کجا و چه زمانی پیدا شده بود؟ هیچکس به طور دقیق نمیدانست؛ اما به چینا مدارکی به اداره حقوقی موزه گتی ارائه داد که حاوی تاریخچه اخیر آن بود؛ طبق مدارک موجود، کورس از سال 1930میلادی در کلکسیون خصوصی یک پزشک سوییسی به نام لوفن برگر نگهداری میشد، که خود او نیز آن را از دلال معروف آثار هنری یونانی به نام روسس خریده بود؛ برای بررسیهای دقیق، زمین شناسی به نام استنلی مارگولیس از دانشگاه کالیفرنیا به موزه آمد و به مدت دو روز سطح مجسمه را با یک استریو میکروسکوپ بسیار حساس مورد آزمایش قرار داد و بعد از زیر زانوی راست مجسمه تکه ای به قطر یک سانتیمتر و طول دو سانتیمتر جدا کرد و با استفاده از میکروسکوپ الکترونی، اشعه انکساری ایکس و اشعه فلورسنسی ایکس به تجزیه آن پرداختمارگولیس به این نتیجه رسید که مجسمه از سنگ مرمر دُلومیت معدن قدیمی کیپ وتی در جزیره تاسوس ساخته شده، و سطح مجسمه با لایه نازکی از کربنات آهک پوشیده شده است ــ که به گفته وی از اهمیت خاصی برخوردار بود ــ زیرا دُلومیت تنها در طول قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند تبدیل به کربنات آهک شود؛ به عبارت دیگر مجسمه شیئی قدیمی بود و تقلبی نبودموزه گتی از این مسئله خشنود بود، و چهارده ماه پس از شروع تحقیقات با خریدن مجسمه موافقت شد؛ در پاییز 1986میلادی مجسمه برای اولین بار به نمایش گذاشته شد؛ نیویورک تایمز حکایت آنرا در صفحه ی اول خود آورد؛ چند ماه بعد متصدی اموال عتیقه ی موزه، ماریون ترو، گزارشی پرشور و بلندبالا از دستیابی موزه به مجسمه، برای مجله برلینگتون نوشت: «اکنون کورس با قامتی برافراشته و دستانی مشت شده حیات مطمئن خویش را که برترین خصلت او و برادرانش است ابراز میکند.» و سپس پیروزمندانه نتیجه گیری کرد: «او چه خدا باشد و چه انسان تجسم کامل نیروی تابناک بلوغ هنری غرب است.»؛ با تمام این احوال مشکلی وجود داشت؛ مجسمه به نظر اصل نمیآمد، اولین کسیکه به این مشکل اشاره کرد، فردی بود به نام فدریکو زِری، مورخ هنرشناس ایتالیایی، که عضو هیئت امنای موزه نیز بود؛ وقتی «زِری» در دسامبر 1983میلادی به محل نگهداری مجسمه رفت، تا آن را ببیند، بی اختیار به ناخنهای آن خیره شد؛ البته نمیخواست توضیحی برای این مسئله بدهد، اما به نظرش یک جای کار ایراد داشت؛ نفر بعدی «اِوِلین هریسون»، یکی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی بود، که هنگام معامله نهایی، در «لس آنجلس» بود؛ او چنین به خاطر میآورد: آن زمان آرتور هافتن متصدی موزه بود، و ما را برای بازدید برد؛ او با یک حرکت پارچه روی مجسمه را پس زد و گفت، «خُب، این هنوز مال ما نیست اما تا چند هفته دیگر خواهد شد.»؛ و من گفتم: «خیلی متاسفم که این را میشنوم.»، هریسون چه دیده بود؟ خودش نمیداند؛ در همان لحظه اول، وقتی «هافتن» پارچه را کنار زده بود، آنچه «هریسون» حس کرده بود، یک الهام بود، یک احساس غریزی از اینکه چیزی آن وسط اشکال داشت؛چند ماه بعد «هافتن»، «تامس هاوینگ» مدیر سابق موزه «متروپولتین» را برای بازدید از مجسمه، به کارگاه مرمّت موزه برد؛ «هاوینگ» همیشه اولین کلمه ای را که با دیدن چیزی از ذهنش میگذرد یادداشت میکند؛ و هرگز فراموش نمیکند اولین کلمه ای که با دیدن «کورس» از ذهنش گذشت چه بود؛هاوینگ میگوید: «آن کلمه «تازه» بود ــ «تازه»، و «تازه» برای مجسمه ای که دوهزار سال قدمت دارد کلمه مناسبی نیست.»؛ «هاوینگ» بعدها که راجع به آن لحظه فکر کرد، فهمید چرا چنین کلمه ای به ذهنش خطور کرده بود: «من در سیسیلی حفاری کرده بودم، جاییکه تکه ها و قطعاتی از این دست پیدا میشوند، اما این یکی به هیچ کدام شبیه نبود؛ به نظر میرسید این مجسمه کورس از توی یکی از همین قوطیهای قهوه مرغوب استارباکس بیرون آمده باشد!» «هاوینگ» رو به «هافتن» پرسید، «آیا برای آن پولی هم پرداخته اید؟» و وقتی با چهره متعجب هافتن مواجه شد، گفت، «اگر پرداخته اید سعی کنید پس بگیرید و معامله را فسخ کنید.»؛ مسئولان موزه «گتی» کم کم داشتند نگران میشدند، بنابراین سمپوزیوم ویژه ای در مورد کورس در یونان برپا کردند؛ مجسمه را بسته بندی کردند و به یونان فرستادند، و از متخصصان ارشد مجسمه شناسی دعوت کردند؛ اینبار زمزمه یاس و دلهره بلندتر به گوش میرسید؛ «هریسون» در کنار مردی ایستاده بود که نامش «جرج دِس پینیس» بود، و رئیس موزه «آرکوپولیس آتن»؛ «جرج دس پینیس» نگاهی به کورس انداخت و رنگش پرید؛ او رو به هریسون گفت: «هر کس یکبار در عمرش مجسمه ای را که از دل خاک بیرون کشیده شده، دیده باشد میتواند تشخیص دهد، این یکی زیرزمین نبوده است.» «جورجیوس دانتاس»، رئیس جمعیت باستانشناسی آتن، به محض اینکه مجسمه را دید تنش یخ کرد؛ او گفت: «وقتی برای اولین بار کورس را دیدم احساس کردم انگار شیشه ای بین من و مجسمه کشیده شده است.»؛در سمپوزیوم، «آنجلوس دِلی وریاس» مدیر موزه «بناکی آتن» نیز گفته های «دانتاس» را تایید کرد؛ او به تفصیل از تناقض بین سبک ساخت مجسمه، و این واقعیت که مرمر آن از معادن تاسوس استخراج شده است، صحبت کرد، و سپس به اصل مطلب رسید؛ چرا او فکر میکرد که مجسمه تقلبی است؟ زیرا وقتی برای اولین بار به آن نگاه انداخته بود موجی از ادراک و دافعه ی حسی در او برانگیخته شده بود؛ زمانیکه سمپوزیوم به پایان رسید در بین اکثر مدعوین این اتفاق نظر وجود داشت، که کورس ابدا آن چیزی نیست که تصور میشدموزه گتی با تمامی متخصصان و وکلای خود و ماهها بررسی دقیق به یک نتیجه رسیده بود، و برخی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی ــ تنها با یک نگاه و احساس دافعه حسی ــ به نتیجه ای دیگر؛ حق با کدام یک بود؟ برای مدتی هیچ چیز مشخص نبود؛ کورس تبدیل به مسئله ای شده بود که متخصصان هنری در کنفرانسهای مختلف بر سر آن بحث و جدل میکردند؛ اما بعد، اندک اندک، ابهامات ماجرای گتی شروع به روشن شدن نمود؛ برای مثال نامه هایی که وکلای گتی به دقت پیگیری کرده بودند و مشخص میکرد که کورس متعلق به یک پزشک سوییسی بوده، جعلی از آب درآمد؛ یکی از نامه هایی که به تاریخ 1952میلادی بود دارای یک کدپستی بود، که تا بیست سال پس از آن تاریخ هنوز وجود خارجی نداشت؛ نامه دیگری که تاریخ 1955میلادی را داشت، به یک حساب بانکی اشاره داشت، که تا تاریخ

نگاه میکردند بیشتر به التقاطی بودن آن پی میبردند؛ هر قسمت از اندام مجسمه مربوط به زمان و مکان متفاوتی بود؛ اندام باریک مرد جوان بیشتر شبیه کورس تنه آ بود که در موزه مونیخ نگهداری میشد، و موهای خوش

سوییس پیدا شده بود؛ هر دو مجسمه از یک سنگ مرمر مشابه و با یک سبک تراشیده شده بود؛ اما کورس سوییسی متعلق به گذشته نبود، بلکه در اوایل دهه هشتاد در کارگاهی در رم ساخته شده بود؛ پس تحقیقات علمی که مشخص میکرد سطح مجسمه کورس تنها پس از قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند به چنین شکلی درآید چه؟ خوب آن نتایج همچندان قطعی نبودند؛ طبق آزمایشها و بررسیهای بعدی زمینشناس دیگری به این نتیجه رسید، که با استفاده از

The man pulls interesting case studies from academic research and news headlines, spins it into a book under a general theme, and blammo! He has a bestseller. This formula worked for him with The Tipping Point and then Blink. Blink is a compelling read, despite its weak overall theme, which is that sometimes split-second decisions are good and sometimes they're bad, and we need to learn when to trust our first impressions and when to discount them (except there's no real way to make that distinction). The book is a pleasure to read simply because of its case studies. Gladwell throws in so many topics — art, politics, marriage, consumer testing, athletes, war, police shootings, music — that there is bound to be something engaging for everyone. (After reading another one of Gladwell's peppy articles in The New Yorker, my husband joked, ""Gladwell thinks he can make ANYTHING seem interesting."")After finishing Blink, I feel like I've learned something important, but I'm not sure exactly what, other than that Gladwell has a very charmed career.My rating: 3.5 stars rounded up to 4"
127,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,3,"This was a big best-seller for Gladwell. He posits that much of the time we make decisions, reach conclusions in a sort of pre-conscious manner that he calls “thin-slicing.” That means taking a very small sample, a thin slice, and making a decision immediately based on that information. However, it is the case that the ability to evaluate that slice is fed by a lifetime of experience. It is not simply, as some, including President Bush the second, might believe, that using one’s gut, in the absence of years and years of preparation, is as valid a way of reaching decisions as taking the longer route of careful analysis of available data. No, no, no."
128,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"I generally distrust anyone who says that they ‘go-with-their-gut’. But when the company I work for announced a major decision a few years back, I instantly said, “This is going to be a huge mistake.” Smart people had examined the deal backwards and forwards for months and thought it was a great idea. I had a bad feeling about it that I could only later explain, and I was far from the only one. And we were right. The entire thing turned out to be a huge disaster. I kept thinking about that incident when I read Blink. The book has a pretty obvious point. People make snap decisions that they can’t consciously explain. Sometimes these decisions are correct and amazing based on the limited amount of information available. Art experts who instantly know a statue is fake despite scientific tests indicating otherwise. A fireman who appears to be fighting a routine small fire suddenly orders his men out without really knowing why and the floor collapses a second later. And sometimes these decisions can be wrong and have tragic consequences. Four cops think a guy has a gun when he’s pulling his wallet out and shoot him multiple times.We’ve all made quick decisions and later been amazed at how good or bad they turned out, but what makes Blink interesting is that Gladwell does some examination of the science behind how we arrive at these conclusions, and his thoughts on how the data we’re processing can either give us incredible insight or lead us horribly wrong.Thankfully, Gladwell is not making an argument against logical thinking or analyzing a problem. What he is doing is pointing out that instinct or intuition can be a powerful tool IF the people involved have trained themselves to make good decisions, and if we know when to trust it. He’s got a lot of great examples of doctors, military officers and police officers who often have to make life-or-death decisions in a matter of seconds with limited information. They have to trust their instincts, and Gladwell makes some common sense points that the right kind of training and education can make a huge difference. He contrasts the story of the four New York cops who killed the guy with a wallet versus a patrolman who did not fire on someone who actually had a gun but was attempting to surrender it.What made this book fun to read was the variety of examples that Gladwell uses and the scientific research done with them. Art dealers, doctors, marriage counselors, cops, military officers, car salesmen, a tennis coach, and classical musicians are all used as examples of the strengths and weaknesses of snap decisions. There’s also some simple experiments included that let you play along at home. This is a book that will make you think about the way you think."
129,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/344817-mackenzie,2,"so i bought this book in boston's logan airport about 10 minutes before i had to board a flight to seattle. the bookstore was limited; i didn't want to have to work to get interested. and the first 100 pages or so did the trick... until i realized that gladwell wasn't so much building an argument as telling stories about a certain topic. don't get me wrong, i finished the book. later. back in boston, on the T. and it did cover some interesting studies, or i wouldn't have done so. but i suspect the author might've lacked the attention span necessary to lend this book any coherence. meh. it was basically a series of loosely related tidbits about snap-judgments, none of which led me to conclude that instinct or intuition is significantly more or less reliable than rational deliberation. if a point could be gleaned and summarized, i guess it would be that with the right thin-slice of information, under the right conditions, instantaneous judgements can be spot-on. shrug. the best i can say about this book is that there were a couple of well-set-up digs at the bush administration and i discovered the music of kenna, who's pretty cool. i also learned that when my girlfriend's eyes get even a little wider, it means she's angry."
130,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak,4,"Much like the reason behind my majoring in Economics, I like Gladwell because he opens my mind to new ideas and new ways to think. Much like Economics, I believe he's far from perfect, but I really enjoy viewing the world through his lens. In just about anything, when people start acting as if there is only one way to do something, I stop listening to them. This goes for many things, but especially politics. If you DO, however, find someone who is omniscient and knows exactly how every policy will turn out in the end, please let me know. I may listen to their one way of seeing the world. Otherwise ...What I got from Blink is that there is a lot to our instant thoughts and feelings and many times much more than we give them credit. The traditional wisdom is to plan and make huge weighty decisions based on every single bit of information that we have at our fingertips (which is just about everything, google!). This is actually a big reason my wife and I get into ... disagreements (we'll go with that). She likes to plan everything down to the last detail and I like to be a bit more relaxed.So it would seem that this book is a big proponent of my way of doing things, but it turns out it's not so much.We should trust our gut-instinct, says Blink, if we have many hours of experience in said realm of understanding because we have developed the skills to make sense of those small details and because we have the ability to ""thin slice."" Gladwell also makes the point that not always can we trust our gut-intinct, however, because our gut-instinct tends to be racist, even when we are not in fact consciously racist. Also, our instincts can get overwhelmed by heightened arousal, such as when people can't even dial 911 in an emergency because their senses are overloaded.But then again, you can practice and have these types of unconscious reactions mitigated.The interesting story-telling style of introducing these topics is, of course, what really gets me. It's the stories that are often unbelievable that have me clamoring for more, just like in Outliers (although I think Outliers was a little better written) and I would assume his other books. He goes into why The Getty art museum spent millions on a fake kouros (Greek statue) and why cops probably aren't racial profiling when they beat people like Rodney King, but because of a few key mistakes such as allowing their unconscious to get overwhelmed and also because they were a group of officers instead of just one.He talks about people who can listen to a couple and tell when they should start talking to their lawyers and people who have developed the actual abilities that are shown in the TV show ""Lie to Me."" How looking at a person's room for 5 minutes may give a complete stranger a better picture of a person than a good friend. I've always loved these types of explanations for things. There's the old wisdom we have and the wisdom we assume when we don't have any other way to describe a particular event and which is completely wrong. I love thinking new ideas, even when it's old news and that's why I'll keep coming back to Gladwell."
131,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"Elsewhere, in one of my other recent reviews, a GoodReads friend (Richard) told me that he had become less infatuated with this book after reading a review by a specialist in the field who gave it a drubbing. I was worried that knowing this might ruin this book for me – but it has not. I really enjoyed this one too. This is the third of Gladwell’s books I’ve read in quick succession and this contained lots of information about things that have made me think and sparked my interest to learn more. It may well be that Gladwell’s style does not appeal to an expert in the field – and that is quite likely to be true, but I’ve found that it is often the case that I’ve been introduced to themes by popularisers and later went on to read more deeply on a subject. I rarely condemn those who introduce me to fascinating topics – and this is a fascinating topic.I’m not going to do a full review, but rather quickly talk about wine. While he was talking about coke and about taste tests I was thinking about wine. He makes the point that when asked to judge jam people do nearly as well as the experts if they are just asked which jam they liked the most, but do much worse than experts if asked to explain why they graded them in the order that they did. That is, if they have to talk about texture and sweetness and citrus flavours – people change how they judge jam and end up picking the worst jam rather than the best. This is because we don’t really know what ‘texture’ is and so trying to slot jams into categories that we don’t really understand means we are most likely to stuff up and confuse ourselves. Now, wine. I wonder if anyone has ever done a test at cellar doors to see what people end up buying and if they pick the nicest wine for the price, or do they buy vinegar instead? I wouldn’t mind betting that there would be something similar happening here – and if you are with someone who says things like, “Oh yes, fruity, but with a back-taste of coal tar” you might end up buying something that is quite disgusting. You know, unless you actually have some idea of what you are talking about, it might be best to shut up and drink the wine.That is the point of this book – learning when to trust your “immediate reactions” and when to question them. I think there is much in this book that is worth knowing and much that is fascinatingly interesting. (The stuff about unconscious racism is so important that everyone should be forced to read this for that alone). But with Richard, I am a little concerned that an expert in the field didn't like this book. All the same, the expert does recommend Made to Stick so I guess that can be the next book I read.There is – as is proven by Dylan Moran – only one way to pick wine:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2gGf..."
132,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,4,"I reread this after realizing I couldn't remember enough to compare with Kahneman`s book. They are mostly aligning, only Kahneman suggests against making snap judgements and relying more on evidence whereas Gladwell gives views from both sides and stays impartial.Blink is about unconscious decision making. Our unconscious side is fascinating, because it seems to be the one that holds the strings most of the time; making very fast decisions, watching out for any threat to our existence. However when our drives (the motivators of unconscious) are in conflict, ourrational mind is quick to get in. The rational mind is also there to make corrections, and making plans. So it seems that mostly we are on autopilot for unimportant things, and also when we have to do something at lightening speed. But at other times even if there is an urge to act instinctively, one should act relying on data rather than on instinct."
133,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,"Probably the best among Gladwell's books. He still stands true to his success mantra - ""Gladwell - The Power of Inductive Reasoning."" But, it was still a well researched and informative book. Blink."
134,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048682-karin,3,"3.4 starsMy interest in this book varied by chapter--by far the best one for me was ""Seven Seconds in the Bronx"" in part because I have a child with a diagnosis on the ""spectrum"" and in part because it answered my question as to why I now see police officers cruising by themselves (this is for an excellent reason, it turns out, but no spoilers as to why!) While I enjoyed The Tipping Point more, I have to say that I am happy to have read this after that particular chapter. This is not to say it's the only one I found interesting, because at least one other one was quite fascinating for me.I do plan to read more books by Gladwell in the future."
135,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1090620-ed,2,"I didn't learn much from this book that I did not already know. I am beginning to suspect that Malcolm Gladwell is not writing books that uncover valuable facts that we should know, but rather is writing books that restate facts we already know but in an interesting way.I like his anecdotal stories very much which is why I finished the book - hoping for more stories. When he lays out the facts, though, his writing is no more interesting than any other scientific author. So, in summary, what we have is a talented writer making certain scientific findings available to a much wider audience than usual. Bravo! However if you want to learn something new, this book or his previous effort, The Tipping Point, is not where to go to find it. I imagine, if I read it, I will find The Outliers, his latest effort, to be similarly constructed.Blink's content is easily summarized. First impressions are often more accurate than conclusions arrived at after much study and analysis. Be careful, though, because first impressions can be troublesome because of people's prejudices. Got it in 254 pages. He does come up with an interesting term, ""thin slicing"", to describe the process of taking in a first impression. Maybe learning that term made reading the whole book worthwhile. Maybe."
136,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"A really great study on how important the first few seconds of anything can be, in any particular situation. Be it that you're an art expert who instantly knows an object is fake, or a police man who thinks that the victim is pulling a gun out of their pocket rather than a wallet, it's very clear that human beings do have this constant auto-pilot running, an unconscious ""survival mode"" that gives us most of the clues we might need in the ""blink"" of an eye, and sometimes those clues might be wrong."
137,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"Gladwell continues his exploration of counter-intuitive ideas about decision-making in BLINK! He opens with a 1983 incident at the J. Paul Getty Museum. The Museum acquired a rare statue from the Greek archaic period. To this day, the Museum maintains that the authenticity of the statue is uncertain. At the time, however, the Museum was certain enough to acquire the piece for just under $10 million. Documentation, and scientific analysis had been relied on as support. However, numerous experts including Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas Hoving pronounced it a fake. It was an intuitive pronouncement which presaged problems later uncovered with both the documentation and scientific analysis. This is the first of many stories Gladwell uses to illustrate how an intuitive reaction can trump logic and analysis.Among the factors that cloud logic is something he calls the adaptive unconscious. It's an unrecognized emotional bias. In the Getty example, the officials wanted the piece to be authentic. It would have been a spectacular acquisition for a newly established museum. This desire diverted critical scrutiny of the supporting evidence. Such an adaptation need not even be emotion based. In an explanation of priming, Gladwell cites psychological studies that illustrate the subconscious effect of pre-conditioning through word lists. Extrapolating from these examples, one might conclude that the casual reader will be highly influenced when reviewing a book by his mood or even surroundings at the time of reading.Gladwell explores other impediments to logical thinking, logic being a type of perceptual filter. Face recognition, he points out, occurs in a completely different part of the brain, and is an integrated reaction as opposed to the kind of multi-step processing that occurs in dealing with language. Athletic and musical achievement rely on these non-verbal neural processes. His own example cites Paul Van Ripper's success against a team backed by the Pentagon's most sophisticated computers in a war games exercise. The Pentagon team was actually hampered in their decision making by information overload. Initial reaction, Gladwell points out is not always accurate. He tries to explore this downside as well by citing studies on bias. Gladwell is an entertaining storyteller as well as an energetic researcher. He draws examples from market research, Chancellorsville in the Civil War, the assessment of heart attacks at Cook County Hospital, speed dating, fire fighting, the auditioning of professional musicians, and the Diallo Incident in the Bronx to illustrate his points. By drawing from such a wide variety of experience, he insures the interest of a broad audience in this book. NOTE: It's always fun to re-encounter characters from other books. I knew of Thomas Hoving from his book, KING OF THE CONFESSORS. The idea of thin-slice thinking was also explored in HOW WE DECIDE, by Jonah Lehrer. The deconstruction of flavor is discussed from a neurophysiological standpoint in Gordon Shepherd's NEUROGASTRONOMY. "

I firmly believe looks matter - hey after all I do live in CA where we have the Governator..."
139,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,2,"I was really expecting more from this book. I've heard mostly good things about Gladwell, and he had a pretty interesting TED talk, and I enjoy almost anything to do with the brain, so...why not?The book certainly brought up a lot of interesting ideas and did a good job of discussing the different elements that go into the snap decisions that we make every day. And it's probably worth a read for many of the stories and experiments related. But for the most part this book really failed to impress. More than that though, it failed at being a coherent analysis of what goes on in the human brain when we make snap judgments. Gladwell alternates between telling us to trust and accept this ""mysterious phenomena"" that allows us to make these unconscious snap judgments and warning us against the use of these snap judgments. One moment he advises against the idea that we need to slowly collect data and weigh options to make the most informed opinion and provides examples where too much thinking and information leads us astray, and in the next moment gives us examples of how snap judgments sometimes go horribly wrong. And he leaves us with no clear sense of how to use this new found information to make better decisions and judgments in our own lives. Do I trust my insights because my rational brain will fool me, or do I mistrust my instincts because of the inherent bias contained within them? If Gladwell knows he sure didn't tell me.One example of somewhere where I think he didn't analyze the situation enough was when he talked about the Wisconsin Card Sorting task (pick cards from one of two decks, one deck tends towards bad and the other towards good outcomes). He focused solely on how the unconscious mind was aware of the pattern (which deck was bad and which was good) long before the conscious mind was aware of it when making decisions. And this was shown by the fact that sweating occurred when choosing from the ""bad"" deck before the subject knew why (or was even aware of it). What he fails to mention about all this is that the reason for this is because we are designed to be ""risk averse"". It is not because we are making brilliant snap judgments, or that our brains have ""learned"" the rules before we are aware of it. From an evolutionary perspective it pays off more to learn from our mistakes than learn from our victories. Mistakes are costly. This is why bad memories are more salient than happy ones. The sweating that occurs is a physiological indicator of and means of prompting the organism to stay away. It's not even that this explanation is in contradiction to Gladwell's; it is that it IS an explanation for the phenomena Gladwell describes, one easily at Gladwells' disposal. Two other aspects of this book stuck out as major frustrations for me:1) Gladwell spends a lot of time early on talking about the mysterious nature of our ability to thin slice (make accurate snap judgments based on very little information) and urges us to accept this. To his credit, he does attempt to demystify this somewhat later on, but not enough in my opinion. His first example is of a museum that purchased an expensive sculpture which all the data and scientists evaluated as legitimate, but which experts in the field immediately saw as a fake without being able to put into words why. It's purposefully misleading to label this as some sort of mysterious phenomena. For instance, it's important to remember that these people were experts. An amateur would not and could not make this same snap judgment because they don't have the training to. This ability didn't magically appear, it came from learning and training and synaptic change. These experts learned over time. They studied types of stone, and different styles, and everything else that goes into understanding their field. And this process created memories...synaptic change within their brains. And there exists a system (or systems) in the brain that can make decisions based on that neuronal structure without conscious awareness. Shortcuts so to speak. But these shortcuts are a product of that neuronal structure, which is a product of that synaptic change, which is a product of the learning the individual did over time. It's misleading to call this mysterious. What's important, and more interesting in my opinion, is figuring out the underlying processes that allow this to happen. 2) Towards the end of the book Gladwell discusses how our stress response leads us to make all sorts of bad decisions. He talks about autism and how autistic people can't mind read (don't have theories of other minds) and how this affects their interpretation of events around them and of the world in general. He compares what happens to people in stressful situations to this, that during these situations, because the fight or flight response has taken over, people have tunnel vision and can no longer ""read minds"" and thus make all sorts of mistakes and bad decisions because they are focusing on the wrong things. My issue is that he, incomprehensibly, makes a literal, as opposed to metaphorical, connection with autism. He argues that during these times we become ""temporarily autistic"". While it's true that one aspect of our behavior becomes similar to an aspect of an autistic individuals behavior during these times, it seems like a pretty ridiculous statement to make as a broad generalization. He spends quite a bit of time talking about this and I don't think it does anyone any good.In the end I think I was most disappointed by the fact that all the elements to create a good book WERE present here, and the failure is due in large part to how he puts it all together and his ability to analyze all the disparate ideas properly (insert irony here). Evolution has built into us shortcuts to react quickly to stimuli in our environment. Our experience, whether broadly cultural or personal, prunes, enhances, changes those built in shortcuts as we go through life. Some develop as unfair biases towards people of different races. Some develop as we become experts in a subject. Thus some can be trusted and some can't. Our brains can't tell the difference between fact and fiction, only between experience and non experience, and so it's important to be aware of what kind of decision making goes on under the surface and what factors are involved in those decisions so we can be more aware of whether to trust them or not. Other factors can affect decision making, such as our emotional state due to the physiological changes that take place during those times, and this too is important to understand because it radically alters our perception during those times. The most important thing to remember is that experience translates into instinct through synaptic change, and through work and training we can increase the effectiveness of our gut reactions and snap decisions, but due to biases and our altered states during emotional situations those instincts should not always be trusted outright. There you go Malcolm Gladwell, please feel free to use this in the next printing. No citation necessary. "
140,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Malcolm Gladwell engagingly writes about how decisions made in a blink--snap judgments--can be very good. A series of entertaining anecdotes and psychological studies show that first impressions can be good in some cases, especially in areas where people have experience. He also writes about experts who analyze facial expressions, and how autistic people have trouble making certain types of judgment calls.But then he goes on to show how our unconscious mind can also be very prejudiced. Tall men are more likely to become CEOs than short men. Using Warren Harding as an example, he shows that people may vote for a political candidate because they look presidential. Women are less likely to be offered positions in some orchestras unless the auditions are held with the competitors behind a screen, so they are just evaluated on their playing ability. He also includes stories about police officers making snap judgments, and the judicial system handing out longer sentences to minorities. There were some examples that supported decisions made quickly by the subconscious level, and other examples that showed certain decisions were better when we slowed down and consciously gave things a little more thought. Experience played a big part in having good judgment making quick decisions. Gladwell does not get into how the brain works in making decisions. The book is interesting and entertaining, but it raises as many questions as it answers. 3.5 stars."

Even as a general reader, I find this book says a lot of things but does not actually tell you what it actually wants to address. But I love this book for totally different reasons. Firstly, I love case studies with interesting results written by someone who can write in a way you will find the whole experience exhilarating. Secondly, this guy deserves a five star because he is making less known but thought-provoking scientific studies to a much wider audience. Thirdly, nowhere it is mentioned in the title it is a book which teaches you how to think without thinking so it is completely understandable why it shows us both the advantages and disadvantages of snap decision making and it completely leaves to the reader to decide when to do what. Finally, I love non-fiction which uses a lot of anecdotes to state a fact rather just directly stating the fact it wants to address. I recommend it to anyone who loves to read about interesting psychological studies. "

143,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/337591-zinta,5,"Where does it all go, after you are done experiencing the experience, thinking the thought, feeling the feeling? Nothing is ever lost. The subconscious is like a vast warehouse, limitless, in fact, and as Malcolm Gladwell illustrates in Blink, we access all that is stored in that warehouse with every blinking and waking moment.Usually, we call this instant access - gut instinct. Or, the inner voice of wisdom. Instinct, however, is nothing magical or mysterious. It is simply our accumulated and stored knowledge over a lifetime. If there was ever an argument for listening to those who have some serious and well-lived years under their belts, this is it. Blink illustrates with numerous and widely varied examples how life experience, the more the better, contributes to our ability to make quick, yet sound decisions. In fact, the quicker, the better.Blink is about what the author calls ""thin slicing."" He defines this process as the moment of time in which we all make snap judgments. Two seconds, two minutes ... and we make an assessment of a situation or a person or a circumstance. The fascinating thing is - these snap judgments are, more often than not, precise ones. It is when we begin to over analyze and rationalize that we tend to go awry. The trick is to allow the accumulated wisdom rise up and do its magic, trust in it.Then again ...Gladwell never does make a concluding statement in his book, and perhaps it is up to the reader to decide (do it quickly?), but his many fascinating examples and his reports on various studies can lead one to think these snap judgments are the way to go - or, then again, thinker beware. For all the many situations in which that moment of initial wisdom is uncannily precise, there are other times that our deeply ingrained biases muck up the clarity of that process. Gladwell cites data to illustrate how stereotypes, for instance, persist - no matter how gallant our conscious efforts to overcome them. Telling yourself you don't really think what you think simply won't work. Only exposure to experiences, or positive visualizations, will change the false ideas and images our subconscious has absorbed over time. All of which is a strong argument for ""garbage in, garbage out."" That is, be careful of what entertainment you choose (e.g. pornographic images, violent movies or games, etc.), because no matter how hard your conscious mind tries to guide you toward decisions and behavior that is more appropriate, your subconscious will always, but always win out.The idea of what you present to your eye is what you will later project out to the world is a convincing one, as the author finds himself unable to beat the test on stereotypes when he has to react quickly. Only exposure to more positive images over time can change his test results and dislodge his prejudices.Gladwell discusses this phenomena of instant response-true response in a manner of ways. How patients respond to their doctors (we sue the physician who has a lousy bedside manner, even if more skilled, but remain loyal to the physician who spends as little as three extra minutes talking with us); how facial expressions, when viewed on slowed down video, will without fail, always reveal deceit (there are facial movements that arise from our subconscious that we cannot control, and no matter how quickly we think we have our facial mask in place, there is always that instant that our faces tell the truth); the intricacies of marketing and advertisement and why the obvious ad, even when based on feedback of focus groups, may not be the effective choice; how military decisions by experienced military leaders are successful, but fail miserably when they are constrained by strategic analysis; how micro-managing in workplaces can only lead to mediocrity while suppressing creativity and innovation; how speed dating may be most effective in finding potential lifelong connections (we read about research that can pick out successful, longterm relationships in observing as little as two minutes of interaction between a couple - and no, it isn't the couple that argues that breaks apart); how our societal subconscious biases for certain physical characteristics, such as height or gender, often mislead us to make dangerously faulty snap judgments (Gladwell observes that most of our leaders are tall and male, and that our corporate world pays tall men higher salaries, factoring dollars down to the inch, regardless of intelligence or ability). On and on, in one fascinating example and study after another, Gladwell intrigues with his findings.And you know he's right. You know it ... in your gut. But if the author doesn't make any overall conclusion from all of this fascinating data, then the reader is left to her own wiles. Experience counts more than credentials. What we expose ourselves to on a regular basis molds who we are, how we view others, what choices we make and how we behave. Biases and prejudices are far stronger than our conscious will to overcome them; we must align our environment to align our subconscious. Our deepest self forgets nothing. All we have ever done and been and seen and observed leads to who we are today and tomorrow.All of which gives one pause. But don't pause too long. It is that initial millisecond that may matter most of all."

Quotes:But in the end it comes down to a matter of respect, and the simplest way that respect is communicated is through tone of voice.Of the tens of millions of American men below five foot six, a grand total of ten in my sample have reached the level of CEO, which says that being short is probably as much of a handicap to corporate success as being a woman or an African American.Most of us, in ways that we are not entirely aware of, automatically associate leadership ability with imposing physical stature....when corrected for such variables as age and gender and weight, an inch of height is worth $789 a year in salary. That means that a person who is six feet tall but otherwise identical to someone who is five foot five will make on average $5,525 more per year.Prejudging is the kiss of death...because sometimes the most unlikely person is flush.The truth is that improv isn't random and chaotic at all...it's an art form governed by a series of rules, and they want to make sure that when they're up on stage, everyone abides by those rules. One of the most important of the rules that make improv possible, for examples is the idea of agreement, the notion that a very simple way to create a story—or humor—is to have characters accept everything that happens to them. Good improvisors seem telepathic; everything looks pre-arranged. This is because they accept all offers made—which is something no normal person would do.Neither Masten nor Rhea believes that clever packaging allows a company to put out a bad-tasting product. The taste of the product itself matters a great deal. Their point is simply that when we put something in our mouth and in that blink of an eye decide whether it tastes good or not, we are reacting not only to the evidence from our taste buds and salivary glands but also to the evidence of our eyes and memories and imaginations, and it is foolish of company to service one dimension and ignore the other.Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process. Silvan Tomkins one began a lecture by bellowing, ""The face is like a penis!"" What he meant was that the face has, to a large extent, a mind of its own.Imagine if there were a switch that all of us had, to turn off the expressions on our face at will. If babies had that switch, we wouldn't know what they were feeling. They'd be in trouble. You could make an argument, if you wanted to, that the system evolved so that parents would be able to take care of kids.People with autism...have difficulty interpreting non-verbal cues, such as gestures and facial expressions...in anything less than a perfectly literal environment, the autistic person is lost.In the interviews with police officers who have been involved with shootings, these same details appear again and again: extreme visual clarity, tunnel vision, diminished sound, and the sense that time is slowing down. This is how the human body reacts to extreme stress, and it makes sense. Our mind, faced with a life-threatening situation, drastically limits the range and amount of information that we have to deal with. Sound and memory and broader social understanding are sacrificed in favor of heightened awareness of the threat directly in front of us."
145,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,2,"I find this book to say very little in the end, at least, little that is useful or that I can apply. We make split-second judgements. Some people more accurately than others. This does not always mean what we think it means.Okay....I guess when the subtitle of a book has the words ""power"" and ""thinking"" in it (""The Power of Thinking Without Thinking""), I expect to gain something from it. Instead I feel like the author explains all the reasons why we should not be relying on snap judgements, despite the fact that some of the time, they are right. I don't find ""some"" to be very useful. If a person can't rely on first impressions, or what the author refers to as ""thin slice"" representations of performance or taste, what good is there in talking about it at all?Then I started thinking about why I read this book in the first place. When the new president of the university where I work started, he talked extensively about Malcolm Gladwell. He referenced this book as well as Outliers. I felt like if I read them, I would understand where he was coming from, and some of the changes he has been making. I have to admit that knowing how much of a decision people make in that first moment could have an impact on how a place is marketed. Even if first impressions don't necessarily become our opinions later on, they still have the power to make a decision in a person's mind, for better or for worse. Still, I'm not sure how you can make that work for you. Is it better to be super-sweet Pepsi that people prefer at the first sip, or more popular Coca-Cola which people are more likely to drink an entire bottle/can of, and make a repeat purchase of? I'd rather be Coke. Can you manufacture enough of a Pepsi experience and then also be Coke? That sounds dangerous to me, because I'm not sure you can be both.""People are ignorant of the things that affect their actions, yet they rarely feel ignorant. We need to accept our ignorance and say 'I don't know' more often.""""How good people's decisions are under the fast-moving, high-stress conditions of rapid cognition is a function of training and rules and rehearsal.""Gladwell does seem to be saying that if you understand the limitations of snap-judgments, you can train yourself to try to lessen bias, prejudice, and incorrect assumptions. It seems to me that the bigger trick is understanding when and how you are doing this to begin with. Write me a book about how to do that, Mr. Gladwell."
146,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/622323-snezan,4,"This work is worth a read, if not more than one. I hesitate to say too much, since I believe the conclusions it reaches are explored in the very beginning and will immediately inform the reader of its relevance. I don't know why that came out so long winded, the reader will find out how interested they are by the first or second chapter.I found the book fascinating for its close look into social interactions, particularly between two people, and for explaining why i sometimes I think the way that I do. The intuitive process of understanding is one that has made a lot of sense to me, and I am glad this book takes a microscope to that underpinning of society's operation. The examples in the book are relevant, timely and buttress the argument well. Especially the story about the psychologist that has a 90 percent success rate of whether a relationship would last past 7 years. The author's decision to skip a little exposition on detractors from the intuitive system of problem solving was a little disappointing, although I do understand that Blink is not, nor pretends to be a scholarly work. Instead it purports to be a lighthouse for a part of our decision-making that is often ignored in society and stays hidden from our conscious understanding. We often don't know why we like or dislike someone the way we do, and yet we allow that judgment to affect our interaction extremely or waffle endlessly over trying to deny or prove our first impression. How many times do you remember saying "" really wanted to like that,"" that being a dress or a person or a book and how much time has it wasted. Or why it sometimes take only a moment for a person to decide whether or not an idea has merit. Gladwell explores those snap judgments in details, and writes in a readable, approachable way. He is not afraid to tackle some controversial topics."
147,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6940509-hannah,1,"1 Star - Horrible book.Against my better judgement I gave another one of Malcolm Gladwell's books a try. Oh, what precious reading time I wasted on this book! My feelings on this book are quite similar to how I felt about The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (my review) so I'll keep this review short. My first thought after finishing this was: did I really just read 200+ pages on what is essentially the good and bad of gut reactions? There was nothing new for me here and that may not entirely be Gladwell's fault but nevertheless I could not enjoy this book. In addition to my lack of interest in the subject matter, I cannot enjoy the author's writing style. I feel he meanders and that there are so many unfinished thoughts and ideas. It drove me crazy!By the end of the book I was frustrated and upset. I recommend this book to no one. "
148,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15355957-rohit-enghakat,3,"Blink is an interesting read. The book is about making decisions in the blink of an eye, to be precise. The author says that decisions which are made instantly are far more fruitful than those made with long drawn research and logical thinking. He cites many examples which are also interesting to read. For example, the description of the Amadou Diallo incident where police officers shot an unarmed black immigrant in New York with forty-one bullets was stunning. Equally interesting was the last example of Abbie Connant playing the trombone traditionally played by a male in the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra.However, somehow the theory did not appeal to me. It is almost akin to relying on sixth sense, although the author tries to prove this scientifically. The book might appeal more to psychologists or psychiatrists. "

150,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174974-matt-kosinski,2,"Here's Blink in a nutshell:Split decisions can be good; better than decisions where we take a lot of time to carefully weigh our options and use scientific evidence. Except when they're not.Rapid cognition is an exciting and powerful way to use your brain's quick, intuitive capabilities to make stunningly accurate decisions, and can even lead you to have better success in sports, business and politics. Except when it won't.We should learn to trust our snap judgments, even in seemingly complex situations where we don't have a lot of information.Except not really.Basically the book gives scientific and anecdotal evidence on why rapid cognition can be both a good and bad thing, without offering us much advise on how to tell the difference between situations where we should or shouldn't trust our instincts. There are many times when I felt that Gladwell contradicted himself. To support his ""rapid cognition is good"" section of the book, he uses an example of a psychological test where students were able to tell whether or not a professor was good at their job by simply watching a 5 second clip of them lecturing with the sound turned off. The results basically corresponded with impressions given by other students who spent an entire class with those professors - thus proving that there is some mysterious and powerful part of our subconscious that can make accurate snap judgments.But then later on in the book, in the ""rapid cognition is bad"" section, Gladwell warns us that, in general, people instantly like tall, attractive white people better than short, unattractive minorities.WELL DUH! OBVIOUSLY THE STUDENTS RATING THE PROFESSORS WERE BIASED BY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE TALL, WHITE, OR ATTRACTIVE! Mystery solved!While Gladwell brings up some interesting concepts, his book never gels into a coherent whole. I read most of it in under a day and already my rapid cognition is telling me it's not worth finishing."
151,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72368-doc-opp,1,"As an empirical psychologist by training, I get very annoyed at journalists who simplify things to the point that its no longer even remotely accurate. Such is the case for Blink. This is especially annoying to me, because the book describes my area of research specialization. If you're interested in a fun read, Gladwell is certainly an engaging author. If you're looking for something that accurately describes the research, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. For example, Scott Plous's ""the psychology of judgment and decision making"" (which, despite the title, is not textbook like), or the Heath brothers' ""Made to stick"". "

Blink
 is- what all the stories, case studies, and arguments add up to- an attempt to understand the magical and mysterious thing called Judgement. Its basic premise is: split second decisions (snap judgements); how they can be good and bad. Gladwell suggests split-seconds decisions are better than the decisions where we take considerable time to weigh our choices and options. He points out that our mind figure things, people, et al. in a blink of an eye. And it is often that these snap judgements are much more trustworthy than judgements arrived at rationally. But he does not stop here and goes on further: snap judgements can be misleading, too; he termed it Warren Harding error. He suggested that there are some instinctive processes that prevent us to see clearly; and hence cloud our judgements. Blink is an interesting read. It is very well written, and at the same time engages your attention from the start. And writing is reader friendly, perfectly suitable for a layman..................................................I bought this book because I was intrigued by the subtitle of the book: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking. This subtitle was something Zen like, I felt. And when I read it initially, three years ago, I found it resembling with Zen teachings (and koans). Following are two quotes that mainly convey the spirit: ""They were so focused on the mechanics and the process that they never looked at the problem holistically. In the act of tearing something apart, you lose its meaning.""""When making a decision of minor importance its advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital matters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the decision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life , we should be governed by the deep inner needs of our nature."""
153,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/546634-ashley,5,"I would put this book in the category of ""Freakonomics"" and ""The Tipping Point."" By the same author as the latter title, Malcolm Gladwell, the purpose of this book is to weigh the advantages as well as the disadvantages of the power of the mind's ability to unconsciously leap to conclusions based on what is seen in the proverbial blink of an eye. While I have read some negative reviews of Gladwell's book, mostly citing that he fails to inform the reader how to know when to go with your gut and when not to, as well as arguments that he urges readers not to follow their gut when the gut instincts are politically incorrect, I have to disagree with many of them. I think that Gladwell's objective in ""Blink"" is to make the reader simply aware of their gut instincts and to urge them to consider trusting it more frequently than we do. People tend to make decisions that are supported by a litany of rationalizations and explanations, but do we always really have reasons for why we do or think what we do? Gladwell is arguing that we don’t, and that sometimes it takes the unconscious mind to make those decisions for us. On the flip side, he also argues that sometimes we unconsciously make negative decisions based on that same quick judgment and our predetermined stereotypes, such as with people of other sexes or other races than ourselves. “Blink” was a very complicated book with many facets and it’s hard to explain all of them or review them all without writing an essay. In the end, I think the main goal isn’t perfect knowledge of the subject of thinking without thinking, but rather consideration of it and how it can benefit us or hinder us both individually and as a society."
154,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186516-margaret-ross,3,"I think this book wins my prize for Most Easily Misinterpreted to Serve Personal Agendas. Gladwell gets so into the interesting details of the case he's building, he really doesn't emphasize the final conclusions of the book at all, leaving people to think that the interesting details are the whole point, which is unfortunate. But then again, I'm not 100% sure I got the whole point.Most of the folks I know think that this book is about how a person's gut instincts can be a better read of a situation than a read based on thorough study. Which is an idea that most people love, since they don't want to have to do all that boring study anyhow. What's missing from that analysis is that Gladwell later insists (but only at the very end of the book, and almost in passing) that it's the thorough active training and study of a subject that allow a person to have ""true"" or ""correct"" gut reads. The guy who can tell who's getting divorced after 60 seconds of hearing them talk spent years coding verbal and physical cues in couples, studying them intensely for years before he was able to give his 60 second analysis. The art historians were drawing on a vast body of knowledge when they made their judgment about the statue. The cop who read fear instead of aggression and didn't shoot couldn't name what he was seeing, but he'd seen it before. Then he also says that our gut reactions can be easily colored by training we don't even know is there- our prejudices, whether unknown or unacknowledged- influence or reads of a situation as well.Ultimately, I saw this book as a reaction to and analysis of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, with some tips for how to avoid such future tragedies. In that light, I thought it was interesting and even constructive, but only if you pay close attention to the last chapter. "

The book begins with the story of the Getty Kouros (Archaic Greek sculptors reduced human anatomy and musculature in these statues to decorative patterning on the surface of the marble.), which was a statue brought to the J. Paul Getty Museum in California. It was thought by many experts to be legitimate, but when others first looked at it, their initial responses were skeptical. For example, George Despinis, head of the Acropolis Museum in Athens, said ""Anyone who has ever seen a sculpture coming out of the ground could tell that thing has never been in the ground"".عنوانها:

1983میلادی، یک دلال آثار هنری به نام جیان فرانکو به چینا به موزه پاول گتی کالیفرنیا مراجعه کرد؛ او ادعا میکرد مجسمه مرمرینی در اختیار دارد که متعلق به شش قرن پیش از میلاد است؛ این مجسمه معروف به کورس بود ـ مجسمه ای از یک مرد جوان برهنه ایستاده با دستانی از دوطرف آویخته و پای چپ جلو نهاده؛ تا آن زمان در حدود دویست مجسمه کورسی از حفاریهای باستانشناسی یا گورهای قدیمی به دست آمده بود که اغلب آنها در هنگام اکتشاف یا متلاشی شده بودند و یا بدجوری آسیب دیده بودند، اما این یکی تقریبا سالم مانده بود؛ ارتفاع این مجسمه نزدیک به دومتر و بیست و پنج سانتیمتر بود و شفافیتی داشت که آن را از بقیه مجسمه های اکتشافی متمایز میکرد؛ این یک کشف خارق العاده بود و مبلغ پیشنهادی به چینا زیر ده میلیون دلار بود؛ موزه گتی با احتیاط وارد عمل شد؛ مجسمه کورس را به امانت گرفت و تحقیق دقیقی را شروع کرد؛ آیا مجسمه با بقیه مجسمه های کورسی همخوانی داشت؟ جواب به ظاهر آری بود؛ شیوه ی ساخت آن به نظر مشابه مجسمه کورس آناویسوس در موزه ملی باستان شناسی آتن بود، و معنایش این بود که با زمان و مکان خاصی مطابقت داشت؛ این مجسمه از کجا و چه زمانی پیدا شده بود؟ هیچکس به طور دقیق نمیدانست؛ اما به چینا مدارکی به اداره حقوقی موزه گتی ارائه داد که حاوی تاریخچه اخیر آن بود؛ طبق مدارک موجود، کورس از سال 1930میلادی در کلکسیون خصوصی یک پزشک سوییسی به نام لوفن برگر نگهداری میشد، که خود او نیز آن را از دلال معروف آثار هنری یونانی به نام روسس خریده بود؛ برای بررسیهای دقیق، زمین شناسی به نام استنلی مارگولیس از دانشگاه کالیفرنیا به موزه آمد و به مدت دو روز سطح مجسمه را با یک استریو میکروسکوپ بسیار حساس مورد آزمایش قرار داد و بعد از زیر زانوی راست مجسمه تکه ای به قطر یک سانتیمتر و طول دو سانتیمتر جدا کرد و با استفاده از میکروسکوپ الکترونی، اشعه انکساری ایکس و اشعه فلورسنسی ایکس به تجزیه آن پرداختمارگولیس به این نتیجه رسید که مجسمه از سنگ مرمر دُلومیت معدن قدیمی کیپ وتی در جزیره تاسوس ساخته شده، و سطح مجسمه با لایه نازکی از کربنات آهک پوشیده شده است ــ که به گفته وی از اهمیت خاصی برخوردار بود ــ زیرا دُلومیت تنها در طول قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند تبدیل به کربنات آهک شود؛ به عبارت دیگر مجسمه شیئی قدیمی بود و تقلبی نبودموزه گتی از این مسئله خشنود بود، و چهارده ماه پس از شروع تحقیقات با خریدن مجسمه موافقت شد؛ در پاییز 1986میلادی مجسمه برای اولین بار به نمایش گذاشته شد؛ نیویورک تایمز حکایت آنرا در صفحه ی اول خود آورد؛ چند ماه بعد متصدی اموال عتیقه ی موزه، ماریون ترو، گزارشی پرشور و بلندبالا از دستیابی موزه به مجسمه، برای مجله برلینگتون نوشت: «اکنون کورس با قامتی برافراشته و دستانی مشت شده حیات مطمئن خویش را که برترین خصلت او و برادرانش است ابراز میکند.» و سپس پیروزمندانه نتیجه گیری کرد: «او چه خدا باشد و چه انسان تجسم کامل نیروی تابناک بلوغ هنری غرب است.»؛ با تمام این احوال مشکلی وجود داشت؛ مجسمه به نظر اصل نمیآمد، اولین کسیکه به این مشکل اشاره کرد، فردی بود به نام فدریکو زِری، مورخ هنرشناس ایتالیایی، که عضو هیئت امنای موزه نیز بود؛ وقتی «زِری» در دسامبر 1983میلادی به محل نگهداری مجسمه رفت، تا آن را ببیند، بی اختیار به ناخنهای آن خیره شد؛ البته نمیخواست توضیحی برای این مسئله بدهد، اما به نظرش یک جای کار ایراد داشت؛ نفر بعدی «اِوِلین هریسون»، یکی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی بود، که هنگام معامله نهایی، در «لس آنجلس» بود؛ او چنین به خاطر میآورد: آن زمان آرتور هافتن متصدی موزه بود، و ما را برای بازدید برد؛ او با یک حرکت پارچه روی مجسمه را پس زد و گفت، «خُب، این هنوز مال ما نیست اما تا چند هفته دیگر خواهد شد.»؛ و من گفتم: «خیلی متاسفم که این را میشنوم.»، هریسون چه دیده بود؟ خودش نمیداند؛ در همان لحظه اول، وقتی «هافتن» پارچه را کنار زده بود، آنچه «هریسون» حس کرده بود، یک الهام بود، یک احساس غریزی از اینکه چیزی آن وسط اشکال داشت؛چند ماه بعد «هافتن»، «تامس هاوینگ» مدیر سابق موزه «متروپولتین» را برای بازدید از مجسمه، به کارگاه مرمّت موزه برد؛ «هاوینگ» همیشه اولین کلمه ای را که با دیدن چیزی از ذهنش میگذرد یادداشت میکند؛ و هرگز فراموش نمیکند اولین کلمه ای که با دیدن «کورس» از ذهنش گذشت چه بود؛هاوینگ میگوید: «آن کلمه «تازه» بود ــ «تازه»، و «تازه» برای مجسمه ای که دوهزار سال قدمت دارد کلمه مناسبی نیست.»؛ «هاوینگ» بعدها که راجع به آن لحظه فکر کرد، فهمید چرا چنین کلمه ای به ذهنش خطور کرده بود: «من در سیسیلی حفاری کرده بودم، جاییکه تکه ها و قطعاتی از این دست پیدا میشوند، اما این یکی به هیچ کدام شبیه نبود؛ به نظر میرسید این مجسمه کورس از توی یکی از همین قوطیهای قهوه مرغوب استارباکس بیرون آمده باشد!» «هاوینگ» رو به «هافتن» پرسید، «آیا برای آن پولی هم پرداخته اید؟» و وقتی با چهره متعجب هافتن مواجه شد، گفت، «اگر پرداخته اید سعی کنید پس بگیرید و معامله را فسخ کنید.»؛ مسئولان موزه «گتی» کم کم داشتند نگران میشدند، بنابراین سمپوزیوم ویژه ای در مورد کورس در یونان برپا کردند؛ مجسمه را بسته بندی کردند و به یونان فرستادند، و از متخصصان ارشد مجسمه شناسی دعوت کردند؛ اینبار زمزمه یاس و دلهره بلندتر به گوش میرسید؛ «هریسون» در کنار مردی ایستاده بود که نامش «جرج دِس پینیس» بود، و رئیس موزه «آرکوپولیس آتن»؛ «جرج دس پینیس» نگاهی به کورس انداخت و رنگش پرید؛ او رو به هریسون گفت: «هر کس یکبار در عمرش مجسمه ای را که از دل خاک بیرون کشیده شده، دیده باشد میتواند تشخیص دهد، این یکی زیرزمین نبوده است.» «جورجیوس دانتاس»، رئیس جمعیت باستانشناسی آتن، به محض اینکه مجسمه را دید تنش یخ کرد؛ او گفت: «وقتی برای اولین بار کورس را دیدم احساس کردم انگار شیشه ای بین من و مجسمه کشیده شده است.»؛در سمپوزیوم، «آنجلوس دِلی وریاس» مدیر موزه «بناکی آتن» نیز گفته های «دانتاس» را تایید کرد؛ او به تفصیل از تناقض بین سبک ساخت مجسمه، و این واقعیت که مرمر آن از معادن تاسوس استخراج شده است، صحبت کرد، و سپس به اصل مطلب رسید؛ چرا او فکر میکرد که مجسمه تقلبی است؟ زیرا وقتی برای اولین بار به آن نگاه انداخته بود موجی از ادراک و دافعه ی حسی در او برانگیخته شده بود؛ زمانیکه سمپوزیوم به پایان رسید در بین اکثر مدعوین این اتفاق نظر وجود داشت، که کورس ابدا آن چیزی نیست که تصور میشدموزه گتی با تمامی متخصصان و وکلای خود و ماهها بررسی دقیق به یک نتیجه رسیده بود، و برخی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی ــ تنها با یک نگاه و احساس دافعه حسی ــ به نتیجه ای دیگر؛ حق با کدام یک بود؟ برای مدتی هیچ چیز مشخص نبود؛ کورس تبدیل به مسئله ای شده بود که متخصصان هنری در کنفرانسهای مختلف بر سر آن بحث و جدل میکردند؛ اما بعد، اندک اندک، ابهامات ماجرای گتی شروع به روشن شدن نمود؛ برای مثال نامه هایی که وکلای گتی به دقت پیگیری کرده بودند و مشخص میکرد که کورس متعلق به یک پزشک سوییسی بوده، جعلی از آب درآمد؛ یکی از نامه هایی که به تاریخ 1952میلادی بود دارای یک کدپستی بود، که تا بیست سال پس از آن تاریخ هنوز وجود خارجی نداشت؛ نامه دیگری که تاریخ 1955میلادی را داشت، به یک حساب بانکی اشاره داشت، که تا تاریخ 1963میلادی هنوز افتتاح نشده بود؛ در اصل نتیجه ی ماهها تحقیق فقط این شد که کورس موزه گتی همان سبک مجسمه آناویسوس را داشت، اما این نتیجه گیری نیز مورد شک بود؛هرچه متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی دقیقتر به آن نگاه میکردند بیشتر به التقاطی بودن آن پی میبردند؛ هر قسمت از اندام مجسمه مربوط به زمان و مکان متفاوتی بود؛ اندام باریک مرد جوان بیشتر شبیه کورس تنه آ بود که در موزه مونیخ نگهداری میشد، و موهای خوش حالتش شبیه کورس موزه متروپولتین نیویورک؛ و در این بین پاهایش چیزی نبودند جز هنر مدرن، از قضا این مجسمه از همه بیشتر شبیه مجسمه شکسته و کوچکتری بود که در سال 1990میلادی، توسط یک هنرشناس بریتانیایی در سوییس پیدا شده بود؛ هر دو مجسمه از یک سنگ مرمر مشابه و با یک سبک تراشیده شده بود؛ اما کورس سوییسی متعلق به گذشته نبود، بلکه در اوایل دهه هشتاد در کارگاهی در رم ساخته شده بود؛ پس تحقیقات علمی که مشخص میکرد سطح مجسمه کورس تنها پس از قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند به چنین شکلی درآید چه؟ خوب آن نتایج همچندان قطعی نبودند؛ طبق آزمایشها و بررسیهای بعدی زمینشناس دیگری به این نتیجه رسید، که با استفاده از کپک سیب زمینی، میتوان در عرض چند ماه سطح مجسمه مرمر دلومیتی را به شکل کهنه و قدیمی درآورد؛ در کاتالوگ موزه گتی تصویری از مجسمه کورس چاپ شده که زیر آن نوشته شده «حدود ۵۳۰سال قبل از میلاد، یا، مدرن جعلی.»؛ زمانیکه «فدریکو زری» و «اِوِلین هریسون» و «تامس هاوینگ» و «جورجیوس دانتاس» ــ و خیلیهای دیگر ــ با یک نگاه به مجسمه دچار دافعه حسی شدند مطمئنا حق داشتند؛ آنها در همان دو ثانیه اول ـ در یک نگاه ـ به شناختی از ماهیت مجسمه دست یافتند که تیم تخصصی موزه گتی پس از چهارده ماه تحقیق هنوز به آن نرسیده بود؛ یک نگاه کتابی است درباره ی همان دو ثانیه نخست.»؛ پایان نقلا. شربیانی"
156,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"O, to have the writing career of Malcolm Gladwell. The man pulls interesting case studies from academic research and news headlines, spins it into a book under a general theme, and blammo! He has a bestseller. This formula worked for him with The Tipping Point and then Blink. Blink is a compelling read, despite its weak overall theme, which is that sometimes split-second decisions are good and sometimes they're bad, and we need to learn when to trust our first impressions and when to discount them (except there's no real way to make that distinction). The book is a pleasure to read simply because of its case studies. Gladwell throws in so many topics — art, politics, marriage, consumer testing, athletes, war, police shootings, music — that there is bound to be something engaging for everyone. (After reading another one of Gladwell's peppy articles in The New Yorker, my husband joked, ""Gladwell thinks he can make ANYTHING seem interesting."")After finishing Blink, I feel like I've learned something important, but I'm not sure exactly what, other than that Gladwell has a very charmed career.My rating: 3.5 stars rounded up to 4"
157,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,3,"This was a big best-seller for Gladwell. He posits that much of the time we make decisions, reach conclusions in a sort of pre-conscious manner that he calls “thin-slicing.” That means taking a very small sample, a thin slice, and making a decision immediately based on that information. However, it is the case that the ability to evaluate that slice is fed by a lifetime of experience. It is not simply, as some, including President Bush the second, might believe, that using one’s gut, in the absence of years and years of preparation, is as valid a way of reaching decisions as taking the longer route of careful analysis of available data. No, no, no."
158,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"I generally distrust anyone who says that they ‘go-with-their-gut’. But when the company I work for announced a major decision a few years back, I instantly said, “This is going to be a huge mistake.” Smart people had examined the deal backwards and forwards for months and thought it was a great idea. I had a bad feeling about it that I could only later explain, and I was far from the only one. And we were right. The entire thing turned out to be a huge disaster. I kept thinking about that incident when I read Blink. The book has a pretty obvious point. People make snap decisions that they can’t consciously explain. Sometimes these decisions are correct and amazing based on the limited amount of information available. Art experts who instantly know a statue is fake despite scientific tests indicating otherwise. A fireman who appears to be fighting a routine small fire suddenly orders his men out without really knowing why and the floor collapses a second later. And sometimes these decisions can be wrong and have tragic consequences. Four cops think a guy has a gun when he’s pulling his wallet out and shoot him multiple times.We’ve all made quick decisions and later been amazed at how good or bad they turned out, but what makes Blink interesting is that Gladwell does some examination of the science behind how we arrive at these conclusions, and his thoughts on how the data we’re processing can either give us incredible insight or lead us horribly wrong.Thankfully, Gladwell is not making an argument against logical thinking or analyzing a problem. What he is doing is pointing out that instinct or intuition can be a powerful tool IF the people involved have trained themselves to make good decisions, and if we know when to trust it. He’s got a lot of great examples of doctors, military officers and police officers who often have to make life-or-death decisions in a matter of seconds with limited information. They have to trust their instincts, and Gladwell makes some common sense points that the right kind of training and education can make a huge difference. He contrasts the story of the four New York cops who killed the guy with a wallet versus a patrolman who did not fire on someone who actually had a gun but was attempting to surrender it.What made this book fun to read was the variety of examples that Gladwell uses and the scientific research done with them. Art dealers, doctors, marriage counselors, cops, military officers, car salesmen, a tennis coach, and classical musicians are all used as examples of the strengths and weaknesses of snap decisions. There’s also some simple experiments included that let you play along at home. This is a book that will make you think about the way you think."
159,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/344817-mackenzie,2,"so i bought this book in boston's logan airport about 10 minutes before i had to board a flight to seattle. the bookstore was limited; i didn't want to have to work to get interested. and the first 100 pages or so did the trick... until i realized that gladwell wasn't so much building an argument as telling stories about a certain topic. don't get me wrong, i finished the book. later. back in boston, on the T. and it did cover some interesting studies, or i wouldn't have done so. but i suspect the author might've lacked the attention span necessary to lend this book any coherence. meh. it was basically a series of loosely related tidbits about snap-judgments, none of which led me to conclude that instinct or intuition is significantly more or less reliable than rational deliberation. if a point could be gleaned and summarized, i guess it would be that with the right thin-slice of information, under the right conditions, instantaneous judgements can be spot-on. shrug. the best i can say about this book is that there were a couple of well-set-up digs at the bush administration and i discovered the music of kenna, who's pretty cool. i also learned that when my girlfriend's eyes get even a little wider, it means she's angry."
160,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak,4,"Much like the reason behind my majoring in Economics, I like Gladwell because he opens my mind to new ideas and new ways to think. Much like Economics, I believe he's far from perfect, but I really enjoy viewing the world through his lens. In just about anything, when people start acting as if there is only one way to do something, I stop listening to them. This goes for many things, but especially politics. If you DO, however, find someone who is omniscient and knows exactly how every policy will turn out in the end, please let me know. I may listen to their one way of seeing the world. Otherwise ...What I got from Blink is that there is a lot to our instant thoughts and feelings and many times much more than we give them credit. The traditional wisdom is to plan and make huge weighty decisions based on every single bit of information that we have at our fingertips (which is just about everything, google!). This is actually a big reason my wife and I get into ... disagreements (we'll go with that). She likes to plan everything down to the last detail and I like to be a bit more relaxed.So it would seem that this book is a big proponent of my way of doing things, but it turns out it's not so much.We should trust our gut-instinct, says Blink, if we have many hours of experience in said realm of understanding because we have developed the skills to make sense of those small details and because we have the ability to ""thin slice."" Gladwell also makes the point that not always can we trust our gut-intinct, however, because our gut-instinct tends to be racist, even when we are not in fact consciously racist. Also, our instincts can get overwhelmed by heightened arousal, such as when people can't even dial 911 in an emergency because their senses are overloaded.But then again, you can practice and have these types of unconscious reactions mitigated.The interesting story-telling style of introducing these topics is, of course, what really gets me. It's the stories that are often unbelievable that have me clamoring for more, just like in Outliers (although I think Outliers was a little better written) and I would assume his other books. He goes into why The Getty art museum spent millions on a fake kouros (Greek statue) and why cops probably aren't racial profiling when they beat people like Rodney King, but because of a few key mistakes such as allowing their unconscious to get overwhelmed and also because they were a group of officers instead of just one.He talks about people who can listen to a couple and tell when they should start talking to their lawyers and people who have developed the actual abilities that are shown in the TV show ""Lie to Me."" How looking at a person's room for 5 minutes may give a complete stranger a better picture of a person than a good friend. I've always loved these types of explanations for things. There's the old wisdom we have and the wisdom we assume when we don't have any other way to describe a particular event and which is completely wrong. I love thinking new ideas, even when it's old news and that's why I'll keep coming back to Gladwell."
161,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"Elsewhere, in one of my other recent reviews, a GoodReads friend (Richard) told me that he had become less infatuated with this book after reading a review by a specialist in the field who gave it a drubbing. I was worried that knowing this might ruin this book for me – but it has not. I really enjoyed this one too. This is the third of Gladwell’s books I’ve read in quick succession and this contained lots of information about things that have made me think and sparked my interest to learn more. It may well be that Gladwell’s style does not appeal to an expert in the field – and that is quite likely to be true, but I’ve found that it is often the case that I’ve been introduced to themes by popularisers and later went on to read more deeply on a subject. I rarely condemn those who introduce me to fascinating topics – and this is a fascinating topic.I’m not going to do a full review, but rather quickly talk about wine. While he was talking about coke and about taste tests I was thinking about wine. He makes the point that when asked to judge jam people do nearly as well as the experts if they are just asked which jam they liked the most, but do much worse than experts if asked to explain why they graded them in the order that they did. That is, if they have to talk about texture and sweetness and citrus flavours – people change how they judge jam and end up picking the worst jam rather than the best. This is because we don’t really know what ‘texture’ is and so trying to slot jams into categories that we don’t really understand means we are most likely to stuff up and confuse ourselves. Now, wine. I wonder if anyone has ever done a test at cellar doors to see what people end up buying and if they pick the nicest wine for the price, or do they buy vinegar instead? I wouldn’t mind betting that there would be something similar happening here – and if you are with someone who says things like, “Oh yes, fruity, but with a back-taste of coal tar” you might end up buying something that is quite disgusting. You know, unless you actually have some idea of what you are talking about, it might be best to shut up and drink the wine.That is the point of this book – learning when to trust your “immediate reactions” and when to question them. I think there is much in this book that is worth knowing and much that is fascinatingly interesting. (The stuff about unconscious racism is so important that everyone should be forced to read this for that alone). But with Richard, I am a little concerned that an expert in the field didn't like this book. All the same, the expert does recommend Made to Stick so I guess that can be the next book I read.There is – as is proven by Dylan Moran – only one way to pick wine:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2gGf..."
162,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,4,"I reread this after realizing I couldn't remember enough to compare with Kahneman`s book. They are mostly aligning, only Kahneman suggests against making snap judgements and relying more on evidence whereas Gladwell gives views from both sides and stays impartial.Blink is about unconscious decision making. Our unconscious side is fascinating, because it seems to be the one that holds the strings most of the time; making very fast decisions, watching out for any threat to our existence. However when our drives (the motivators of unconscious) are in conflict, ourrational mind is quick to get in. The rational mind is also there to make corrections, and making plans. So it seems that mostly we are on autopilot for unimportant things, and also when we have to do something at lightening speed. But at other times even if there is an urge to act instinctively, one should act relying on data rather than on instinct."
163,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,"Probably the best among Gladwell's books. He still stands true to his success mantra - ""Gladwell - The Power of Inductive Reasoning."" But, it was still a well researched and informative book. Blink."
164,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048682-karin,3,"3.4 starsMy interest in this book varied by chapter--by far the best one for me was ""Seven Seconds in the Bronx"" in part because I have a child with a diagnosis on the ""spectrum"" and in part because it answered my question as to why I now see police officers cruising by themselves (this is for an excellent reason, it turns out, but no spoilers as to why!) While I enjoyed The Tipping Point more, I have to say that I am happy to have read this after that particular chapter. This is not to say it's the only one I found interesting, because at least one other one was quite fascinating for me.I do plan to read more books by Gladwell in the future."
165,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1090620-ed,2,"I didn't learn much from this book that I did not already know. I am beginning to suspect that Malcolm Gladwell is not writing books that uncover valuable facts that we should know, but rather is writing books that restate facts we already know but in an interesting way.I like his anecdotal stories very much which is why I finished the book - hoping for more stories. When he lays out the facts, though, his writing is no more interesting than any other scientific author. So, in summary, what we have is a talented writer making certain scientific findings available to a much wider audience than usual. Bravo! However if you want to learn something new, this book or his previous effort, The Tipping Point, is not where to go to find it. I imagine, if I read it, I will find The Outliers, his latest effort, to be similarly constructed.Blink's content is easily summarized. First impressions are often more accurate than conclusions arrived at after much study and analysis. Be careful, though, because first impressions can be troublesome because of people's prejudices. Got it in 254 pages. He does come up with an interesting term, ""thin slicing"", to describe the process of taking in a first impression. Maybe learning that term made reading the whole book worthwhile. Maybe."
166,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"A really great study on how important the first few seconds of anything can be, in any particular situation. Be it that you're an art expert who instantly knows an object is fake, or a police man who thinks that the victim is pulling a gun out of their pocket rather than a wallet, it's very clear that human beings do have this constant auto-pilot running, an unconscious ""survival mode"" that gives us most of the clues we might need in the ""blink"" of an eye, and sometimes those clues might be wrong."
167,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"Gladwell continues his exploration of counter-intuitive ideas about decision-making in BLINK! He opens with a 1983 incident at the J. Paul Getty Museum. The Museum acquired a rare statue from the Greek archaic period. To this day, the Museum maintains that the authenticity of the statue is uncertain. At the time, however, the Museum was certain enough to acquire the piece for just under $10 million. Documentation, and scientific analysis had been relied on as support. However, numerous experts including Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas Hoving pronounced it a fake. It was an intuitive pronouncement which presaged problems later uncovered with both the documentation and scientific analysis. This is the first of many stories Gladwell uses to illustrate how an intuitive reaction can trump logic and analysis.Among the factors that cloud logic is something he calls the adaptive unconscious. It's an unrecognized emotional bias. In the Getty example, the officials wanted the piece to be authentic. It would have been a spectacular acquisition for a newly established museum. This desire diverted critical scrutiny of the supporting evidence. Such an adaptation need not even be emotion based. In an explanation of priming, Gladwell cites psychological studies that illustrate the subconscious effect of pre-conditioning through word lists. Extrapolating from these examples, one might conclude that the casual reader will be highly influenced when reviewing a book by his mood or even surroundings at the time of reading.Gladwell explores other impediments to logical thinking, logic being a type of perceptual filter. Face recognition, he points out, occurs in a completely different part of the brain, and is an integrated reaction as opposed to the kind of multi-step processing that occurs in dealing with language. Athletic and musical achievement rely on these non-verbal neural processes. His own example cites Paul Van Ripper's success against a team backed by the Pentagon's most sophisticated computers in a war games exercise. The Pentagon team was actually hampered in their decision making by information overload. Initial reaction, Gladwell points out is not always accurate. He tries to explore this downside as well by citing studies on bias. Gladwell is an entertaining storyteller as well as an energetic researcher. He draws examples from market research, Chancellorsville in the Civil War, the assessment of heart attacks at Cook County Hospital, speed dating, fire fighting, the auditioning of professional musicians, and the Diallo Incident in the Bronx to illustrate his points. By drawing from such a wide variety of experience, he insures the interest of a broad audience in this book. NOTE: It's always fun to re-encounter characters from other books. I knew of Thomas Hoving from his book, KING OF THE CONFESSORS. The idea of thin-slice thinking was also explored in HOW WE DECIDE, by Jonah Lehrer. The deconstruction of flavor is discussed from a neurophysiological standpoint in Gordon Shepherd's NEUROGASTRONOMY. "

I firmly believe looks matter - hey after all I do live in CA where we have the Governator..."
169,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,2,"I was really expecting more from this book. I've heard mostly good things about Gladwell, and he had a pretty interesting TED talk, and I enjoy almost anything to do with the brain, so...why not?The book certainly brought up a lot of interesting ideas and did a good job of discussing the different elements that go into the snap decisions that we make every day. And it's probably worth a read for many of the stories and experiments related. But for the most part this book really failed to impress. More than that though, it failed at being a coherent analysis of what goes on in the human brain when we make snap judgments. Gladwell alternates between telling us to trust and accept this ""mysterious phenomena"" that allows us to make these unconscious snap judgments and warning us against the use of these snap judgments. One moment he advises against the idea that we need to slowly collect data and weigh options to make the most informed opinion and provides examples where too much thinking and information leads us astray, and in the next moment gives us examples of how snap judgments sometimes go horribly wrong. And he leaves us with no clear sense of how to use this new found information to make better decisions and judgments in our own lives. Do I trust my insights because my rational brain will fool me, or do I mistrust my instincts because of the inherent bias contained within them? If Gladwell knows he sure didn't tell me.One example of somewhere where I think he didn't analyze the situation enough was when he talked about the Wisconsin Card Sorting task (pick cards from one of two decks, one deck tends towards bad and the other towards good outcomes). He focused solely on how the unconscious mind was aware of the pattern (which deck was bad and which was good) long before the conscious mind was aware of it when making decisions. And this was shown by the fact that sweating occurred when choosing from the ""bad"" deck before the subject knew why (or was even aware of it). What he fails to mention about all this is that the reason for this is because we are designed to be ""risk averse"". It is not because we are making brilliant snap judgments, or that our brains have ""learned"" the rules before we are aware of it. From an evolutionary perspective it pays off more to learn from our mistakes than learn from our victories. Mistakes are costly. This is why bad memories are more salient than happy ones. The sweating that occurs is a physiological indicator of and means of prompting the organism to stay away. It's not even that this explanation is in contradiction to Gladwell's; it is that it IS an explanation for the phenomena Gladwell describes, one easily at Gladwells' disposal. Two other aspects of this book stuck out as major frustrations for me:1) Gladwell spends a lot of time early on talking about the mysterious nature of our ability to thin slice (make accurate snap judgments based on very little information) and urges us to accept this. To his credit, he does attempt to demystify this somewhat later on, but not enough in my opinion. His first example is of a museum that purchased an expensive sculpture which all the data and scientists evaluated as legitimate, but which experts in the field immediately saw as a fake without being able to put into words why. It's purposefully misleading to label this as some sort of mysterious phenomena. For instance, it's important to remember that these people were experts. An amateur would not and could not make this same snap judgment because they don't have the training to. This ability didn't magically appear, it came from learning and training and synaptic change. These experts learned over time. They studied types of stone, and different styles, and everything else that goes into understanding their field. And this process created memories...synaptic change within their brains. And there exists a system (or systems) in the brain that can make decisions based on that neuronal structure without conscious awareness. Shortcuts so to speak. But these shortcuts are a product of that neuronal structure, which is a product of that synaptic change, which is a product of the learning the individual did over time. It's misleading to call this mysterious. What's important, and more interesting in my opinion, is figuring out the underlying processes that allow this to happen. 2) Towards the end of the book Gladwell discusses how our stress response leads us to make all sorts of bad decisions. He talks about autism and how autistic people can't mind read (don't have theories of other minds) and how this affects their interpretation of events around them and of the world in general. He compares what happens to people in stressful situations to this, that during these situations, because the fight or flight response has taken over, people have tunnel vision and can no longer ""read minds"" and thus make all sorts of mistakes and bad decisions because they are focusing on the wrong things. My issue is that he, incomprehensibly, makes a literal, as opposed to metaphorical, connection with autism. He argues that during these times we become ""temporarily autistic"". While it's true that one aspect of our behavior becomes similar to an aspect of an autistic individuals behavior during these times, it seems like a pretty ridiculous statement to make as a broad generalization. He spends quite a bit of time talking about this and I don't think it does anyone any good.In the end I think I was most disappointed by the fact that all the elements to create a good book WERE present here, and the failure is due in large part to how he puts it all together and his ability to analyze all the disparate ideas properly (insert irony here). Evolution has built into us shortcuts to react quickly to stimuli in our environment. Our experience, whether broadly cultural or personal, prunes, enhances, changes those built in shortcuts as we go through life. Some develop as unfair biases towards people of different races. Some develop as we become experts in a subject. Thus some can be trusted and some can't. Our brains can't tell the difference between fact and fiction, only between experience and non experience, and so it's important to be aware of what kind of decision making goes on under the surface and what factors are involved in those decisions so we can be more aware of whether to trust them or not. Other factors can affect decision making, such as our emotional state due to the physiological changes that take place during those times, and this too is important to understand because it radically alters our perception during those times. The most important thing to remember is that experience translates into instinct through synaptic change, and through work and training we can increase the effectiveness of our gut reactions and snap decisions, but due to biases and our altered states during emotional situations those instincts should not always be trusted outright. There you go Malcolm Gladwell, please feel free to use this in the next printing. No citation necessary. "
170,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Malcolm Gladwell engagingly writes about how decisions made in a blink--snap judgments--can be very good. A series of entertaining anecdotes and psychological studies show that first impressions can be good in some cases, especially in areas where people have experience. He also writes about experts who analyze facial expressions, and how autistic people have trouble making certain types of judgment calls.But then he goes on to show how our unconscious mind can also be very prejudiced. Tall men are more likely to become CEOs than short men. Using Warren Harding as an example, he shows that people may vote for a political candidate because they look presidential. Women are less likely to be offered positions in some orchestras unless the auditions are held with the competitors behind a screen, so they are just evaluated on their playing ability. He also includes stories about police officers making snap judgments, and the judicial system handing out longer sentences to minorities. There were some examples that supported decisions made quickly by the subconscious level, and other examples that showed certain decisions were better when we slowed down and consciously gave things a little more thought. Experience played a big part in having good judgment making quick decisions. Gladwell does not get into how the brain works in making decisions. The book is interesting and entertaining, but it raises as many questions as it answers. 3.5 stars."

Even as a general reader, I find this book says a lot of things but does not actually tell you what it actually wants to address. But I love this book for totally different reasons. Firstly, I love case studies with interesting results written by someone who can write in a way you will find the whole experience exhilarating. Secondly, this guy deserves a five star because he is making less known but thought-provoking scientific studies to a much wider audience. Thirdly, nowhere it is mentioned in the title it is a book which teaches you how to think without thinking so it is completely understandable why it shows us both the advantages and disadvantages of snap decision making and it completely leaves to the reader to decide when to do what. Finally, I love non-fiction which uses a lot of anecdotes to state a fact rather just directly stating the fact it wants to address.

173,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/337591-zinta,5,"Where does it all go, after you are done experiencing the experience, thinking the thought, feeling the feeling? Nothing is ever lost. The subconscious is like a vast warehouse, limitless, in fact, and as Malcolm Gladwell illustrates in Blink, we access all that is stored in that warehouse with every blinking and waking moment.Usually, we call this instant access - gut instinct. Or, the inner voice of wisdom. Instinct, however, is nothing magical or mysterious. It is simply our accumulated and stored knowledge over a lifetime. If there was ever an argument for listening to those who have some serious and well-lived years under their belts, this is it. Blink illustrates with numerous and widely varied examples how life experience, the more the better, contributes to our ability to make quick, yet sound decisions. In fact, the quicker, the better.Blink is about what the author calls ""thin slicing."" He defines this process as the moment of time in which we all make snap judgments. Two seconds, two minutes ... and we make an assessment of a situation or a person or a circumstance. The fascinating thing is - these snap judgments are, more often than not, precise ones. It is when we begin to over analyze and rationalize that we tend to go awry. The trick is to allow the accumulated wisdom rise up and do its magic, trust in it.Then again ...Gladwell never does make a concluding statement in his book, and perhaps it is up to the reader to decide (do it quickly?), but his many fascinating examples and his reports on various studies can lead one to think these snap judgments are the way to go - or, then again, thinker beware. For all the many situations in which that moment of initial wisdom is uncannily precise, there are other times that our deeply ingrained biases muck up the clarity of that process. Gladwell cites data to illustrate how stereotypes, for instance, persist - no matter how gallant our conscious efforts to overcome them. Telling yourself you don't really think what you think simply won't work. Only exposure to experiences, or positive visualizations, will change the false ideas and images our subconscious has absorbed over time. All of which is a strong argument for ""garbage in, garbage out."" That is, be careful of what entertainment you choose (e.g. pornographic images, violent movies or games, etc.), because no matter how hard your conscious mind tries to guide you toward decisions and behavior that is more appropriate, your subconscious will always, but always win out.The idea of what you present to your eye is what you will later project out to the world is a convincing one, as the author finds himself unable to beat the test on stereotypes when he has to react quickly. Only exposure to more positive images over time can change his test results and dislodge his prejudices.Gladwell discusses this phenomena of instant response-true response in a manner of ways. How patients respond to their doctors (we sue the physician who has a lousy bedside manner, even if more skilled, but remain loyal to the physician who spends as little as three extra minutes talking with us); how facial expressions, when viewed on slowed down video, will without fail, always reveal deceit (there are facial movements that arise from our subconscious that we cannot control, and no matter how quickly we think we have our facial mask in place, there is always that instant that our faces tell the truth); the intricacies of marketing and advertisement and why the obvious ad, even when based on feedback of focus groups, may not be the effective choice; how military decisions by experienced military leaders are successful, but fail miserably when they are constrained by strategic analysis; how micro-managing in workplaces can only lead to mediocrity while suppressing creativity and innovation; how speed dating may be most effective in finding potential lifelong connections (we read about research that can pick out successful, longterm relationships in observing as little as two minutes of interaction between a couple - and no, it isn't the couple that argues that breaks apart); how our societal subconscious biases for certain physical characteristics, such as height or gender, often mislead us to make dangerously faulty snap judgments (Gladwell observes that most of our leaders are tall and male, and that our corporate world pays tall men higher salaries, factoring dollars down to the inch, regardless of intelligence or ability). On and on, in one fascinating example and study after another, Gladwell intrigues with his findings.And you know he's right. You know it ... in your gut. But if the author doesn't make any overall conclusion from all of this fascinating data, then the reader is left to her own wiles. Experience counts more than credentials. What we expose ourselves to on a regular basis molds who we are, how we view others, what choices we make and how we behave. Biases and prejudices are far stronger than our conscious will to overcome them; we must align our environment to align our subconscious. Our deepest self forgets nothing. All we have ever done and been and seen and observed leads to who we are today and tomorrow.All of which gives one pause. But don't pause too long. It is that initial millisecond that may matter most of all."
174,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/159227-carolyn,3,"Equally as fascinating as Gladwell's other book The Tipping Point. Really makes you think, consider your decisions differently. Quotes:But in the end it comes down to a matter of respect, and the simplest way that respect is communicated is through tone of voice.Of the tens of millions of American men below five foot six, a grand total of ten in my sample have reached the level of CEO, which says that being short is probably as much of a handicap to corporate success as being a woman or an African American.Most of us, in ways that we are not entirely aware of, automatically associate leadership ability with imposing physical stature....when corrected for such variables as age and gender and weight, an inch of height is worth $789 a year in salary. That means that a person who is six feet tall but otherwise identical to someone who is five foot five will make on average $5,525 more per year.Prejudging is the kiss of death...because sometimes the most unlikely person is flush.The truth is that improv isn't random and chaotic at all...it's an art form governed by a series of rules, and they want to make sure that when they're up on stage, everyone abides by those rules. One of the most important of the rules that make improv possible, for examples is the idea of agreement, the notion that a very simple way to create a story—or humor—is to have characters accept everything that happens to them. Good improvisors seem telepathic; everything looks pre-arranged. This is because they accept all offers made—which is something no normal person would do.Neither Masten nor Rhea believes that clever packaging allows a company to put out a bad-tasting product. The taste of the product itself matters a great deal. Their point is simply that when we put something in our mouth and in that blink of an eye decide whether it tastes good or not, we are reacting not only to the evidence from our taste buds and salivary glands but also to the evidence of our eyes and memories and imaginations, and it is foolish of company to service one dimension and ignore the other.Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process. Silvan Tomkins one began a lecture by bellowing, ""The face is like a penis!"" What he meant was that the face has, to a large extent, a mind of its own.Imagine if there were a switch that all of us had, to turn off the expressions on our face at will. If babies had that switch, we wouldn't know what they were feeling. They'd be in trouble. You could make an argument, if you wanted to, that the system evolved so that parents would be able to take care of kids.People with autism...have difficulty interpreting non-verbal cues, such as gestures and facial expressions...in anything less than a perfectly literal environment, the autistic person is lost.In the interviews with police officers who have been involved with shootings, these same details appear again and again: extreme visual clarity, tunnel vision, diminished sound, and the sense that time is slowing down. This is how the human body reacts to extreme stress, and it makes sense. Our mind, faced with a life-threatening situation, drastically limits the range and amount of information that we have to deal with. Sound and memory and broader social understanding are sacrificed in favor of heightened awareness of the threat directly in front of us."
175,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,2,"I find this book to say very little in the end, at least, little that is useful or that I can apply. We make split-second judgements. Some people more accurately than others. This does not always mean what we think it means.Okay....I guess when the subtitle of a book has the words ""power"" and ""thinking"" in it (""The Power of Thinking Without Thinking""), I expect to gain something from it. Instead I feel like the author explains all the reasons why we should not be relying on snap judgements, despite the fact that some of the time, they are right. I don't find ""some"" to be very useful. If a person can't rely on first impressions, or what the author refers to as ""thin slice"" representations of performance or taste, what good is there in talking about it at all?Then I started thinking about why I read this book in the first place. When the new president of the university where I work started, he talked extensively about Malcolm Gladwell. He referenced this book as well as Outliers. I felt like if I read them, I would understand where he was coming from, and some of the changes he has been making. I have to admit that knowing how much of a decision people make in that first moment could have an impact on how a place is marketed. Even if first impressions don't necessarily become our opinions later on, they still have the power to make a decision in a person's mind, for better or for worse. Still, I'm not sure how you can make that work for you. Is it better to be super-sweet Pepsi that people prefer at the first sip, or more popular Coca-Cola which people are more likely to drink an entire bottle/can of, and make a repeat purchase of? I'd rather be Coke. Can you manufacture enough of a Pepsi experience and then also be Coke? That sounds dangerous to me, because I'm not sure you can be both.""People are ignorant of the things that affect their actions, yet they rarely feel ignorant. We need to accept our ignorance and say 'I don't know' more often.""""How good people's decisions are under the fast-moving, high-stress conditions of rapid cognition is a function of training and rules and rehearsal.""Gladwell does seem to be saying that if you understand the limitations of snap-judgments, you can train yourself to try to lessen bias, prejudice, and incorrect assumptions. It seems to me that the bigger trick is understanding when and how you are doing this to begin with. Write me a book about how to do that, Mr. Gladwell."
176,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/622323-snezan,4,"This work is worth a read, if not more than one. I hesitate to say too much, since I believe the conclusions it reaches are explored in the very beginning and will immediately inform the reader of its relevance. I don't know why that came out so long winded, the reader will find out how interested they are by the first or second chapter.I found the book fascinating for its close look into social interactions, particularly between two people, and for explaining why i sometimes I think the way that I do. The intuitive process of understanding is one that has made a lot of sense to me, and I am glad this book takes a microscope to that underpinning of society's operation. The examples in the book are relevant, timely and buttress the argument well. Especially the story about the psychologist that has a 90 percent success rate of whether a relationship would last past 7 years. The author's decision to skip a little exposition on detractors from the intuitive system of problem solving was a little disappointing, although I do understand that Blink is not, nor pretends to be a scholarly work. Instead it purports to be a lighthouse for a part of our decision-making that is often ignored in society and stays hidden from our conscious understanding. We often don't know why we like or dislike someone the way we do, and yet we allow that judgment to affect our interaction extremely or waffle endlessly over trying to deny or prove our first impression. How many times do you remember saying "" really wanted to like that,"" that being a dress or a person or a book and how much time has it wasted. Or why it sometimes take only a moment for a person to decide whether or not an idea has merit. Gladwell explores those snap judgments in details, and writes in a readable, approachable way. He is not afraid to tackle some controversial topics."
177,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6940509-hannah,1,"1 Star - Horrible book.Against my better judgement I gave another one of Malcolm Gladwell's books a try. Oh, what precious reading time I wasted on this book! My feelings on this book are quite similar to how I felt about The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (my review) so I'll keep this review short. My first thought after finishing this was: did I really just read 200+ pages on what is essentially the good and bad of gut reactions? There was nothing new for me here and that may not entirely be Gladwell's fault but nevertheless I could not enjoy this book. In addition to my lack of interest in the subject matter, I cannot enjoy the author's writing style. I feel he meanders and that there are so many unfinished thoughts and ideas. It drove me crazy!By the end of the book I was frustrated and upset. I recommend this book to no one. "
178,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15355957-rohit-enghakat,3,"Blink is an interesting read. The book is about making decisions in the blink of an eye, to be precise. The author says that decisions which are made instantly are far more fruitful than those made with long drawn research and logical thinking. He cites many examples which are also interesting to read. For example, the description of the Amadou Diallo incident where police officers shot an unarmed black immigrant in New York with forty-one bullets was stunning. Equally interesting was the last example of Abbie Connant playing the trombone traditionally played by a male in the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra.However, somehow the theory did not appeal to me. It is almost akin to relying on sixth sense, although the author tries to prove this scientifically. The book might appeal more to psychologists or psychiatrists. "
179,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13506550-hirdesh,3,3.5 stars. Review to come.It wasn;t upto the mark as I had expected.
180,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545336-mike,5,"Blink is an elegant 5 Star piece of science writing, dealing with how we think and chose in an instant. We make snap decisions based on experience or some other basis. Sometimes that is good and sometimes not. There are many good reviews so I am not going to spend more time on a review. What I will point out are two examples of how this book remains relevant today.First example is the recent campaign by Coca-Cola to sell specially colored white/silver cans of Coke over the 2011-2012 winter season to support “the plight of the polar bears.” Now, regardless of what you think about the motivation, the Cokeheads didn’t do their homework very well. In the book, Gladwell gives an example of a time 7-UP changed the shade of their green can and people complained that they had changed the taste. The 7-UP folks had simply changed the outside of the can, not the inside. Well, the very same thing happened to Coke. People started complaining the taste of regular Coke was different and sales started to go down. Well, astute businessmen that they are, the Cokies changed back to the normal red can ahead of schedule and sales went right back up, complaints went away. A simple reading of this book could have avoided this little mixup. (Coke continued the campaign to support the polar bears, or rather, the enviro’s who claim special concern over the bears plight).Another example is when I saw this principle in action. I was in the hospital recovery room after my son had an operation. A older couple was at another station as the wife was also recovering. One of the nurses offered her a soda and she asked for a Diet Coke. Well, the nurse reached into the small refrig and pulled out what looked like a Diet Coke but was really one of the special white/silver regular Coke cans. Only at the very last moment did the wife notice it wasn’t a diet drink. The thing is she is a diabetic and the sugary regular Coke would not have been good for her. Again, a brief glance resulted in a snap decision that could have been a real problem. Had the human factors folks at Coke read this book, maybe they would have noted this.I like Gladwell. He explains science simply and makes me feel smarter than I really am. Thanks dude."
181,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,4,"I've been listening to Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman while reading this book and the two are very closely related. I liked Blink more, so far. (Haven't completely finished the Kahneman one yet.) Gladwell is an excellent storyteller and, though he includes many scientific studies, Blink feels more approachable than Thinking Fast and Slow.The end result of reading back-to-back books on psychology that deal with our decision making processes and the problems/biases that we may have with them is that it has me doubting everything I've thought about or had to make a decision about for the past couple of days. I guess that's the sign of good literature, it makes you think and changes your worldview. While being slightly disturbed by all of this new input, I've also been wondering about how I can apply this new knowledge to its up-most potential.For example, I know within milliseconds of someone coming up to the reference desk, if the interaction I'm about to have with them is going to proceed smoothly or not. It's in their face, their pacing, if they're carrying something in their hands or not- I don't know how I know, I just know. From reading Gladwell's book, I think I do a combination of body language reading and then prime myself for whatever I think I've read in that glance about the person I'm about to deal with. Maybe I could prime myself to expect the best interaction for every experience? Maybe I could slow down the process of the gut check reaction? Anyway, this book taught me that I can do better and that perhaps I shouldn't rely on that immediate first impression to drive the rest of the action. Maybe I could set up a screen in front of my desk and then respond only to people's questions instead of how they're approaching me like how the interviewers removed the initial bias in the blind orchestral auditions... now there's an idea.If you enjoyed Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking then you may like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (more of a scientific approach to the same topic) or The Truth About Trust: How It Determines Success in Life, Love, Learning, and More by David DeSteno (mind blowing book, at least it was for me, on trust, and how we make our decisions to trust or not)."
182,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30261451-celia,4,"This is a book about intuition: when it is right and when it can be fatally WRONG. I was impressed with all that was said in this book and am still thinking about why!!In the meantime, my husband stole my copy, so before I really get into why, I will have to steal it back!!I did listen to this book as well. It is narrated by the author. Malcolm Gladwell is a great speaker with a properly modulated voice and sympathetic tone. "
183,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65250-sheila,4,"This book was really interesting. It discusses the way in which people can ""thin-slice"" a situation in a matter of seconds and make a judgement. This is where pre-conceived notions such as stereotypes can affect the way we react to something under a time constraint. It's about how our unconscious mind figures things out and affects how we feel or affects our actions before we even realize what is happening. Even if you aren't a racist, you can be programmed to act as a racist by the things you are exposed to in society. Even if you don't think you are sexist, you are more sexist than you think, due to programming. We associate things like home with mother and work with father. Examined in the book are police brutality, predictions of whether a couple will stay together (just by examining 15 min. of conversation), reading facial expressions, how one firefighter was able to thin slice a situation so quickly that he was able to save his men.The study I found most interesting was the analysis of an autistic man. We have a part of our brain we use for facial recognition and another part we use for object recognition. The autistic man used the object part of his brain for both facial recognition and for things like recognizing that an object was a chair. The autistic man would watch a movie and not ""get"" the emotional things happening because he barely paid attention to faces and didn't distinguish meaning from them. A new police officer, for example, in a time of distress where his heart is racing, he just finished chasing a man in his car for an hour, will become ""autistic"" so to speak because he ignores all cues and shoots a man to death. All he perceives is a threat and he forgets the person. A police officer with more experience will be able to ""thin slice"" the situation better in a matter of seconds and avoid an unecessary shooting.In order to be a good ""thin-slicer"", you probably have a lot of experience with what you are examining and it just becomes second nature. Some people are just naturally good at reading faces, predicting outcomes, and making those snap decisions that happen in the blink of an eye. Others, well, not as good! I feel that the book could use more focus, but overall, a good read.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the mysterious ways our minds work. "
184,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,3,"Won't do my typical long review for this book. I'm actually writing something more substantial that deals with these issues, so I'll save some of my energy for that. (And there is quite a bit more that needs reading). The short-short version of my usual long review is that Gladwell has some very good exploratory writing that he has written through anecdotes. This shouldn't surprise Gladwell fans. The problem with this book is that we never know whether he is intervening in the art vs. science debate, the intuitive vs. structured methods debate, or the rationalist vs. heuristic learning debate. If we were to read the book through any of these perspectives, unsurprisingly, the answer would be -- it all depends. Intuition can be the answer -- unless it's the problem. Intuition can be made better, through science. Unless our science is actually the problem, in that case, trust expert judgement (not necessarily the same thing as intuition, right?). The concepts get fuzzy. And actually, it seems like Gladwell is taking liberties with his subject matter to explore a range of things that might only be slightly related. One might take away from this book that we need to be aware of our own cognition, or that we need something called an epistemological frame. How do we know what we know? When is information too much information? When do we need rigor? When do we need to make a decision quickly? In any case, we're not sure what we're supposed to take away because the book hasn't quite settled into a fuller version of itself. That is my intuition as a writer. Gladwell has a second or third draft, but not quite a final draft. And that final draft might be a little beyond his capabilities. He might need a co-author, more time, or expertise to help his cause. There is a deep literature that deals with all of these subjects of epistemology, analytical failure, art vs. science (and so on). But since the book scrapes the surface of applied psychology, we're left with a few good stories and some things to think about. One has to remember that the author is a journalist and kind of intellectual voyeur -- thin-slicing is not only one of the topics of his book, it is also his profession. Not bad for a book written for a popular audience, but not great. "
185,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43449419-rawa-a,3,"This is going to be a very interesting review ..I was introduced to this book through Thinking, Fast And Slow and was very excited to read it; the idea is brilliant, it dwells on one of my favorite topics in psychology, and who doesn't want to have a deeper understanding of their own thought processes?It started with the Kouros story which was a great choice in my opinion to start the book with. In retrospect, it kind of summarized the whole book in a story format. One of my fav. I also really liked the idea of temporary autism and it's safe to say that it got me interested to the extent of wanting to know more about it and I honestly won't mind a book dedicated to it. The book also touched upon Priming in good details compared to other similar books. A huge chunk of the book, and by that I mean >70% of it, were examples to the ""Fast Thinking"" process, or the Blink in this book's terms, and if you've been reading my reviews you should realize by this point that I really love stories as examples as long as I get my share (I go with big portions here) of facts, science, and evidence based info. I was forced to compare the ""Blink"" to ""Fast Thinking"" introduced in Thinking, Fast And Slow, where the author in the later provided a huge deal of facts along with the multiple examples. I didn't find this in blink, in fact, I felt it's a good support for ""System 1"" (a synonym for fast thinking in the book's terms) , read before or after it to provide deeper understanding of it, it that is wanted. It won't have satisfied me at all as a standalone (maybe cuz I read the other book before it?)Another thing, the writer seemed a bit unsure, although he did lean more towards one of the opinions. Apart from repeating himself (and the incidents) a couple of times, he fluctuated between trusting our blink or going with deliberate thinking. Overall, this was a good read and I'll recommend it to others ✨."
186,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1698621-amy,4,"Fascinating book! I would describe Blink as promoting self-awareness more than self-help. It's a captivating exploration of the ability of our unconscious minds to accurately(much of the time)read the world around us. The psychological studies featured offered refreshing evidence that it isn't always in our best interest to slow down and think rationally. I wouldn't base an investment strategy on Gladwell's ""thin-slicing"" methods, but when it comes to matters of life and death, love, trust and marriage, oh, and battle tactics, Blink makes a convincing argument to ""go with our gut."" "
187,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49049055-parth-agrawal,4,"An awesome choice of title first of all as it aptly highlights the direction in which the present day decision making process is going towards. With increasing complexity and requirement of multi tasking, decision making is that one quality that every one yearns for. But the travesty of the truth is that very few are there amongst us who really know the process of decision making. Well I used to think that you sit, process and decide. That's one method ofcourse. The other one that comes to my mind is you run, slip, dash and just pick one from the options available to you with just hope, and logic being the last thing, on your side. ;pAdding to the joy, various experimental findings have been highlighted in the book forming the crux of the fun which I won't disclose here as it'll rob you off the fun in it. IN the book, author explicitly says that decision making process actually has two approaches. The first one that i mentioned above involves comprehension, cognition and lot of data crunching leading to the conclusion. But the underlying assumption in this process is that you have an unlimited supply of time (which is hardly ever the case). The second one that i mentioned above is called rapid cognition and in a cursory glance it would seem to you as a random act. We pick an option under such circumstance only when we know that picking is compulsory and we would be better off with a wrong choice rather than with no choice at all. If someone picks the right one, losers instantaneously brand it as luck by chance. What if i told you that even behind your rapid cognition, there is a basis. There's reason that you chose a particular option and only that option amongst all the options. It has a direct relation with the memories and experiences that have created your subconscious since you have stepped foot on this planet.The best example of this can be seen in our own society. If some guy is seen with a tattoo, long hair, ostentatious clothes, our mind immediately forms an image of him as someone who's born with a silverspoon or has no regards for the life he is living, he must be arrogant, impertinent etc etc. Where do all these ideas come from? They are nothing more than what we have been fed into our minds repeatedly and on a daily basis. In India, the organisational hierarchy of the family leaves little room for individual thought process and as an aftermath, the habit of questioning and curiosity goes down the drain. Cultural practices as such, leads to the creation of these kind of biases and prejudices which in turn has brewed a great deal of hypocrisy in our generation as the same characteristics that I mentioned above becomes desirable to an individual and even after he/she attains it, he/she remains contemptuous of the practice as a whole because that's what he/she has been fed with. How often have we seen that a guy in public transport even if mistakenly outrages the modesty of a female passenger, the crowd goes berserk and thrash the guy presuming that he must have had bad intentions. His pleas and requests fall upon deaf ears as people have already taken a snap judgement and no amount of explanation can convince them otherwise. Talking about all this brings us to a very important question. Are we slaves to our snap judgments? Can't we break free the shackles of biases and prejudices? To answer this, it is important to know that there is one big similarity between our conscious and subconscious thinking process. Both of them can be trained and taught through repetitive exercises only. It might be possible for some of you to think that since subconscious decision making is a quick process, training it will also be likewise but it isn't. Author substantiates this claim by quoting instances in the book in which body guards, police officers are provided training of this sort in which they control their adrenaline rush by repeatedly practicing in high-stress situations in which they learn to control their heart-rates, resisting their brains to keep the amount of input from dropping which ultimately helps them to take judicious action in such situations. Thomas Hoving, a curator, says that:"" I try my best to create best first impressions of the people, activity or an object during my first interaction as I believe that our subconscious is an untapped source of abilities and possibilities and it can be educated and trained in a manner such that we harness it for the greater good and for all this to happen, I need to have a positive frame of mind for every new experience of life."" Do you agree? I most certainly do;);).   "
188,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28613204-sara,5,From page 265: “The key to good decision making is not knowledge. It is understanding. We are swimming in the former. We are desperately lacking in the latter.” (So true! What good is all the world’s info at our fingertips if we don’t have the wisdom necessary to properly execute it?)
189,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627983-mahlon,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written yet another thought-provoking book. In Blink he postulates that often our first impressions or gut instincts are more likely to lead us to the the correct decision than if we spent a long time gathering information and weighing out the pros and cons of the particular situation. In other words, you should ""trust your gut"" In trademark Gladwell fashion he uses many entertaining stories and case studies to illustrate his points, while at the same time cautioning against trusting your first impressions too much. I don't think his arguments are as well articulated as those in The Tipping Point, but I'll leave that up to the individual reader to decide for themselves.My previous complaints about Gladwell's organization, and the repetition of his writing are still valid. I find reading the beginning of one of his chapters to be a very enjoyable experience, but by mid-chapter I usually find the going excruciatingly slow, and by the end I feel as if I've been wandering around the desert for days, and have finally found my way back to civilization. Despite these minor flaws, at the end of his books I always find myself excited as to what his next project might be, and eager to share his insights with others. "
190,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/537086-sarah,5,"LOVED this book. I read ""The Tipping Point"" awhile ago and found both books equally fascinating. The short subject studies that the author uses are interesting, easy to follow, and compelling evidence of his ""theory"" or study in first impressions. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sociology, psychology, or who spends a lot of time interacting with people. You will learn how and when to trust your ""gut feeling"" or first impressions of people, situations, and products. A great read!"

I love his writing and they way he can relate two things (or more) in such an intimate manner when at first they appear as just random events. That is a gift. This book is the 6th one that I've read by this author. I didn't like it as much as some of his other books. It didn't have the same edge as the others. It did however have some of the same entertainment appeal, so 3 stars."

196,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explores the phenomenon he calls 'thin slicing'; the human ability to winnow out, in fractions of a second, salient facts from a mass of information and make a decision based on them. Something most of us do all the time without giving it much conscious thought – reading the facial expressions and body language of the people with whom we interact, walking down a busy street (or a quiet street late at night), our subconscious minds processing hundreds or even thousands of bits of information, deciding which few are important and making a judgement based on them.Gladwell illustrates his thesis using several extended examples. The first is relatively straight forward. In 1983 California's Getty museum was offered a 2500 year old Greek statue, a kouros, for $10 million. All the tests said it was genuine but several art experts, at first glance and without being able to say precisely why, knew it was a fake. He also tells the stories of how an ugly chair conquered the offices of the world, how we are all effected by racial conditioning, how Chicago's Cook County hospital improved diagnosis of heart attacks by removing a physician's knowledge from the process, how a commander using WWII technology defeated the combined might of the the US armed forces in the largest ever war game, and more.The author uses two main studies to demonstrate how this process of instant assessment works. John Gottman's 'love lab', where he gets couples to talk about a subject tangentially connected with their relationship and videos the exchange to bring out the non-verbal cues, and Paul Ekman, who is an expert of facial micro-expressions that last microseconds and over which we have no control (this latter also being the model for the excellent TV show Lie To Me with Tim Roth). Gladwell builds his argument convincingly and refers back to his examples frequently for both illustration and dramatic effect. Each example he uses shows a different facet of the Blink effect but also, and this is vital, how it can go wrong in certain circumstances.While it is quick, this subconscious ability does require a moment to work, and can be short circuited by rushing or by an overload of adrenaline. Another case study chillingly shows what can happen when our subconscious is not given the opportunity to work properly. In 1999 an unarmed, innocent man, Amadou Diallo, was shot 41 times in the entryway of his own New York apartment building, by four policemen. He shows how a lack of experience, over-hasty action and perhaps even the over-confidence of numbers allowed these policemen to fall back on crude stereotypes and allow an initial poor assessment to lead them down a tragic course of events.While Gladwell lauds the benefits of both listening to this subconscious supercomputer and developing the skills, in backing up the studies he constantly refers to the fact that this understanding has often been achieved by the exact opposite type of mentation – deliberate, analytical evaluation of evidence. This, along with the examples given, should show the reader that there are appropriate and inappropriate areas for this sort of thinking, although I can imagine some of the readership taking away only the face-value lesson of relying on first instincts and gut feelings. I would have liked to see a chapter on the abuse of these impressions, which is after all how con artists and frauds such as psychics operate. This could have been perhaps added into the chapter on Warren G. Harding, who was elected as US president because he was tall, handsome, masculine, dignified – and is considered by historians to be one of the worst presidents in US history. I want to take nothing away from this excellent book, however. It is superbly written, making excellent use of pacing and the storylines of the examples he uses to give the book structure. Malcolm Gladwell has a great style, authoritative and engaging, and he packs a great deal of both information and analysis into what is a quick, easy and enjoyable read."
197,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6738834-fay-al,4,"Most of us don't know how our decision making / thinking process works. Turns out we're on auto pilot more often than not. Imagine if you had to think routine tasks everyday: walking, manipulating basic objects, recognizing faces, language...etc that would be exhausting and would consume much needed energy.“The mind operates most efficiently by relegating a good deal of high-level, sophisticated thinking to the unconscious, just as a modern jetliner is able to fly on automatic pilot with little or no input from the human, ‘conscious’ pilot. The adaptive unconscious does an excellent job of sizing up the world, warning people of danger, setting goals, and initiating action in a sophisticated and efficient manner.”We think we fully control every decision, but that's only what your mind is leading you to believe..... what we think of as free will is largely an illusion: much of the time, we are simply operating on automatic pilot, and the way we think and act — and how well we think and act on the spur of the moment — are a lot more susceptible to outside influences than we realize.Well it turns out, it's not that straightforward or under our conscious control as much as we'd like it to be:Reading Blink enables one to have a better idea of how it all works and become aware of the biases/influences that cloud our judgment. And there's plenty of examples & experiments in the book that highlights our ""flawed judgment"". And I think what all of this also means is that we're vulnerable to anyone wishing to manipulate us given that they know how our minds work better than we do.One experiment mentioned in the book about facial expressions struck me as very interesting. The face is not just a projection of what we think and feel, it also works the other way around.They gathered a group of volunteers and hooked them up to monitors measuring their heart rate and body temperature — the physiological signals of such emotions as anger, sadness, and fear. Half of the volunteers were told to try to remember and relive a particularly stressful experience. The other half were simply shown how to create, on their faces, the expressions that corresponded to stressful emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear. The second group, the people who were acting, showed the same physiological responses, the same heightened heart rate and body temperature, as the first group.A few years later, a German team of psychologists conducted a similar study. They had a group of subjects look at cartoons, either while holding a pen between their lips — an action that made it impossible to contract either of the two major smiling muscles, the risorius and the zygomatic major — or while holding a pen clenched between their teeth, which had the opposite effect and forced them to smile. The people with the pen between their teeth found the cartoons much funnier. These findings may be hard to believe, because we take it as a given that first we experience an emotion, and then we may — or may not — express that emotion on our face. We think of the face as the residue of emotion. What this research showed, though, is that the process works in the opposite direction as well. Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process."
198,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028530-caron,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written a book about the power of first impressions (aka intuition/ your gut feeling). He provides a series of anecdotes about the process of first reactions including a tale about a forged ancient Greek statue at the Getty that some experts deemed as authentic and others classified as a fake upon sight. In another anecdote, he scrutinizes a ""couples lab"" where psychologist John Gottman determines if a matched pair will last the test of time by studying their conversation for 15 minutes - -he accurately predicts their fate about 90% of the time.Gladwell coins the term ""thin-slicing"" to capture these small snippets in time when a human judges a situation in an instant like a first date, hiring an employee, or meeting a new colleague. Human beings tend to take a first glance and ""thin-slice"" what they perceive through sight or interactions with the situation or individual. Rapid fire cognition is scary to many individuals and Gladwell believes that if ""we paid more attention to those fleeting moments...it would change the way wars are fought, the kinds of products we see on the shelves, the kinds of movies that get made, the way police officers are trained, the way couples are counseled...If you combine all those little changes together, you end up with a different and happier world."" How profound! He is attempting to bring psychology to the masses and does so artfully, choosing his words and sharping his ideas with high-interest examples to engage the reader. Gladwell further discusses ""priming,"" a term used to refer to subtle triggers that influence human behavior without any awareness of such changes (ex. Spain played classical music on subways and littering and vandalism decreased).The book incited much discussion with my book club membership- - thought provoking questions and topics selected from the Blink Reading Group Guide, but membership barely scratched the surface in their debate. This book caused the group to make many connections to their own lives and world. Conversation often digressed into self-reflective wondering or observations.Gladwell wants all readers to believe that intuition is often more reliable that reasoning and a series of data. But is that really the case? One criticism - he never addresses the brain in a scientific manner. In my own experience, I have learned (and am still learning) that I need to pay more attention to my intuition, my first gut instinct. I do not always think that ""thin-slicing"" is as reliable as collecting data and observations in many instances, but there is something to say about my first impressions of situations or people. I need to have more confidence about my ""gut impressions"" and have more faith in ME. Gladwell's book Blink substantiated that there is a certain degree of accuracy in my intuition. "
199,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5564285-sara-j-kefuwa,5,"This was the first Gladwell book I read. I read and finished it during my backpacking trip across Cambodia. I read it amongst the ruins of ancient temples, on bumpy dusty tuk-tuk rides, I held on to it while on the boat waiting for the freshwater dolphins to crest the surface of the mighty Mekong, I read it while sitting cross legged on the floor of the aisle of a public bus on the 2-hour ride back to Siem Reap.But even without all that hazy semi-sense-of-adventure-backpacking state of mind... I would still recommend this book to anyone. Or any of Mssr Gladwell's books honestly speaking (up to the date of this review I have read them all except for 'Tipping Point' and 'David & Goliath', ironically -or maybe rather quite properly Gladwellian- the first & latest of his books). In a nutshell, this book is about how intrinsically we know things. But how all that is usually drowned out or pushed to the corner of ones mind by a lot of good old crusty 'preconception', 'social upbringing' and 'societal brainwashing'. But maybe it's not something that comes when we think about it. Anyhow the main concept/theory in this book is not bedrock to be sure, but somewhat elastic. Something to be taken with a grain of salt. Just as relying too much on facts and proof takes the fun out of life, not caring at all about facts and proof takes out the foundations of sound character. Trust your gut, people. Trust your gut. But don't try too hard."
200,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38240230-dawn,4,"Audiobook read by the author. I'm going to keep this review short but I'm going to say it is an easy read and definitely worth reading. Basically, it is about the information our brains and subconscious process in the 'blink' of an eye. It's surprising how our subconscious knows what is happening in a scenario before we do. Gladwell provided many different scenarios and anecdotal stories throughout the book that were fascinating and eye-opening. It's sad to learn that we all are quick to judge and have many different stereotypes imbedded in our subconscious and conscious. The author's own anecdotal story of when he grew his hair out and the things that happened to him as a result is crazy. And he just had longer hair. So imagine all the other factors that play into someone's appearance and the quick judgements our subconscious starts to make. But this book isn't just about stereotypes. I also found the section on analyzing married couples fascinating. An expert (I forget his name) is able to 'thin slice' a couple's interaction with each other and can tell with 90% accuracy if they will stay married or not. Maybe this would be a good tool for counselors and therapists to learn before couples get married? Definitely recommend. 4 stars."
201,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,3,"I seem to be destined to be disappointed by every book that I pick up these days. Perhaps I am just in a reading funk, but this book, too, left me a bit unsatisfied. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but the book was essentially a series of anecdotes about instinct. Gladwell may call it ""thin-slicing"" but the book is really about making snap judgments, stereotyping, if you will. It's the judgment that we make in the first few seconds of an interaction, a judgment made in the ""blink"" of an eye. Often, if not always, these judgments are more true than the ones made with greater reflection and we ignore these ""thin-slices"" at our peril. That, in a nutshell (or a thin-slice), is the thesis of this book. It is an interesting theory and one that I find amicable. My personal experience seems to confirm it. Still, I would have liked to see the whole thing fleshed out just a bit more. It just seemed a bit lightweight overall, but interesting as pop science. "

I have to admit, in the first chapter I had a little knee-jerk reaction when I thought he was saying that our intuitive reactions are invariably correct. As I continued to read I appreciated his skill in outlining the complexity of his theory, and the fact that only one who is trained in a particular field can really articulate what is happening in his or her unconscious decision-making process. He also explained how that unconscious reaction can be skewed by unrelated factors, thus completely disproving my knee-jerk disagreement."

206,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178887-max-stone,3,"The general topic was how powerful our initial impressions are because we can process stuff really quick at a subconscious level in some cases. Blink was well written and pretty entertaining. I thought the author did a good job of coming up with interesting examples of good or bad information processing and I enjoyed reading those. However, aside from writing style and some fun examples, I thought the content was quite neatly separable into two parts:  (a) stuff that was interesting and seemed true and which I knew already, and  (b) stuff that seemed untrue or at least incoherant and that I hadn't previously heard before. but maybe that was just my closed mind at work. Examples of (a) were how you one's initial impression (lke in the first 5 seconds) of a teacher or an interviewee are pretty highly correlated with your opinion after an hour.There were lots of examples of (b). Like it was weird that one of his first and favorite examples was this guy who had studied videos of couples interacting in intense detail for decades, and had created a list for how someone could score such videos to predict odds that the marriage would last. It was supposed to be an example of ""blink"" processing because the expert could recognize it quickly, but to me it seemed more like the opposite since (1) non-experts (including the author) all had inaccurate instinctive reactions to watching the videos, and (2) the best way to get the right answer was a mechanical scorecard -- kind of the opposite of blink.And in general, there were examples of when you should trust your blink instinct and when that was wrong, but all the examples of when it was right or wrong seemed very post hoc (e.g. if your heart rate is over some threshold you shouldn't, but I don't think that would have come up unless he needed some explanation for why accidental police shootings occured), and he didn't really have a consistent framework for when it would be right or wrong, which made it kinda useless. and some seemed random, like the part about some musicians that musical experts liked but that did poorly in the musical equivalent of blind taste tests -- seemed likely that it was a friend of the author or some musician he liked (it was clear in the book that we should take as a given that it was a good musician and that the taste tests were wrong -- I was never quite clear why) and he was just trying to think of some way that might connect to his thesis.I liked the description of how orchestras started doing blind auditions to avoid discrimination against women. wasn't sure that it supported his thesis, but it was interesting. that was more or less my reaction to the whole book."

It has to do with trends: what makes something popular and who is involved in that process and why it works. This isn't a look at advertising or corporate businesses (although the does look at those, too) but rather a journey into the dynamics and parts of these trends. It's an intriguing and well written book, ideal for anyone who wants to know how social trends work. It has pracitcal applications as well, if you have any desire to make social changes yourself.""Blink"" is more on a personal level, and looks at how our subconcious works and how important it is in our daily life and daily choices. This book is amazing, and I highly recommend it for everyone. ""Tipping"" is really interesting and carries some amazing social insights, but only applies directly to those who wish to institute change, ""Blink"" on the other hand is a must-read for anyone who has ever wondered why they make the split-second decisions they make and whether they're good or bad. Which I hope is everyone. Malcolm Gladwell has an amazing way of writing as though he was chatting over a cup of coffee. His books are full of amazing insight, research, and profound ideas that revolutionize the world we live it, but there is never a point that you feel lost, like these ideas are only something the smart kids can truly understand. Another thing I truly enjoy is his absolute lack of preachieness. His opinions are strongly stated, but never forced on you."

But be careful, though, because: When we make a second split decision, we are also very vulnerable to being guided by our stereotypes and prejudices, even ones we may not necessarily endorse or believe.So what is the practical solution to make a split second decision? This ability improves with practice. Apparently, our unconscious thinking is no different from our conscious thinking: in both, we are able to develop our rapid decision making with training and experience.Probably one of the best psychology books that I’ve read.

210,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545336-mike,5,"Blink is an elegant 5 Star piece of science writing, dealing with how we think and chose in an instant. We make snap decisions based on experience or some other basis. Sometimes that is good and sometimes not. There are many good reviews so I am not going to spend more time on a review. What I will point out are two examples of how this book remains relevant today.First example is the recent campaign by Coca-Cola to sell specially colored white/silver cans of Coke over the 2011-2012 winter season to support “the plight of the polar bears.” Now, regardless of what you think about the motivation, the Cokeheads didn’t do their homework very well. In the book, Gladwell gives an example of a time 7-UP changed the shade of their green can and people complained that they had changed the taste. The 7-UP folks had simply changed the outside of the can, not the inside. Well, the very same thing happened to Coke. People started complaining the taste of regular Coke was different and sales started to go down. Well, astute businessmen that they are, the Cokies changed back to the normal red can ahead of schedule and sales went right back up, complaints went away. A simple reading of this book could have avoided this little mixup. (Coke continued the campaign to support the polar bears, or rather, the enviro’s who claim special concern over the bears plight).Another example is when I saw this principle in action. I was in the hospital recovery room after my son had an operation. A older couple was at another station as the wife was also recovering. One of the nurses offered her a soda and she asked for a Diet Coke. Well, the nurse reached into the small refrig and pulled out what looked like a Diet Coke but was really one of the special white/silver regular Coke cans. Only at the very last moment did the wife notice it wasn’t a diet drink. The thing is she is a diabetic and the sugary regular Coke would not have been good for her. Again, a brief glance resulted in a snap decision that could have been a real problem. Had the human factors folks at Coke read this book, maybe they would have noted this.I like Gladwell. He explains science simply and makes me feel smarter than I really am. Thanks dude."
211,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,4,"I've been listening to Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman while reading this book and the two are very closely related. I liked Blink more, so far. (Haven't completely finished the Kahneman one yet.) Gladwell is an excellent storyteller and, though he includes many scientific studies, Blink feels more approachable than Thinking Fast and Slow.The end result of reading back-to-back books on psychology that deal with our decision making processes and the problems/biases that we may have with them is that it has me doubting everything I've thought about or had to make a decision about for the past couple of days. I guess that's the sign of good literature, it makes you think and changes your worldview. While being slightly disturbed by all of this new input, I've also been wondering about how I can apply this new knowledge to its up-most potential.For example, I know within milliseconds of someone coming up to the reference desk, if the interaction I'm about to have with them is going to proceed smoothly or not. It's in their face, their pacing, if they're carrying something in their hands or not- I don't know how I know, I just know. From reading Gladwell's book, I think I do a combination of body language reading and then prime myself for whatever I think I've read in that glance about the person I'm about to deal with. Maybe I could prime myself to expect the best interaction for every experience? Maybe I could slow down the process of the gut check reaction? Anyway, this book taught me that I can do better and that perhaps I shouldn't rely on that immediate first impression to drive the rest of the action. Maybe I could set up a screen in front of my desk and then respond only to people's questions instead of how they're approaching me like how the interviewers removed the initial bias in the blind orchestral auditions... now there's an idea.If you enjoyed Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking then you may like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (more of a scientific approach to the same topic) or The Truth About Trust: How It Determines Success in Life, Love, Learning, and More by David DeSteno (mind blowing book, at least it was for me, on trust, and how we make our decisions to trust or not)."

213,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65250-sheila,4,"This book was really interesting. It discusses the way in which people can ""thin-slice"" a situation in a matter of seconds and make a judgement. This is where pre-conceived notions such as stereotypes can affect the way we react to something under a time constraint. It's about how our unconscious mind figures things out and affects how we feel or affects our actions before we even realize what is happening. Even if you aren't a racist, you can be programmed to act as a racist by the things you are exposed to in society. Even if you don't think you are sexist, you are more sexist than you think, due to programming. We associate things like home with mother and work with father. Examined in the book are police brutality, predictions of whether a couple will stay together (just by examining 15 min. of conversation), reading facial expressions, how one firefighter was able to thin slice a situation so quickly that he was able to save his men.The study I found most interesting was the analysis of an autistic man. We have a part of our brain we use for facial recognition and another part we use for object recognition. The autistic man used the object part of his brain for both facial recognition and for things like recognizing that an object was a chair. The autistic man would watch a movie and not ""get"" the emotional things happening because he barely paid attention to faces and didn't distinguish meaning from them. A new police officer, for example, in a time of distress where his heart is racing, he just finished chasing a man in his car for an hour, will become ""autistic"" so to speak because he ignores all cues and shoots a man to death. All he perceives is a threat and he forgets the person. A police officer with more experience will be able to ""thin slice"" the situation better in a matter of seconds and avoid an unecessary shooting.In order to be a good ""thin-slicer"", you probably have a lot of experience with what you are examining and it just becomes second nature. Some people are just naturally good at reading faces, predicting outcomes, and making those snap decisions that happen in the blink of an eye. Others, well, not as good! I feel that the book could use more focus, but overall, a good read.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the mysterious ways our minds work. "
214,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,3,"Won't do my typical long review for this book. I'm actually writing something more substantial that deals with these issues, so I'll save some of my energy for that. (And there is quite a bit more that needs reading). The short-short version of my usual long review is that Gladwell has some very good exploratory writing that he has written through anecdotes. This shouldn't surprise Gladwell fans. The problem with this book is that we never know whether he is intervening in the art vs. science debate, the intuitive vs. structured methods debate, or the rationalist vs. heuristic learning debate. If we were to read the book through any of these perspectives, unsurprisingly, the answer would be -- it all depends. Intuition can be the answer -- unless it's the problem. Intuition can be made better, through science. Unless our science is actually the problem, in that case, trust expert judgement (not necessarily the same thing as intuition, right?). The concepts get fuzzy. And actually, it seems like Gladwell is taking liberties with his subject matter to explore a range of things that might only be slightly related. One might take away from this book that we need to be aware of our own cognition, or that we need something called an epistemological frame. How do we know what we know? When is information too much information? When do we need rigor? When do we need to make a decision quickly? In any case, we're not sure what we're supposed to take away because the book hasn't quite settled into a fuller version of itself. That is my intuition as a writer. Gladwell has a second or third draft, but not quite a final draft. And that final draft might be a little beyond his capabilities. He might need a co-author, more time, or expertise to help his cause. There is a deep literature that deals with all of these subjects of epistemology, analytical failure, art vs. science (and so on). But since the book scrapes the surface of applied psychology, we're left with a few good stories and some things to think about. One has to remember that the author is a journalist and kind of intellectual voyeur -- thin-slicing is not only one of the topics of his book, it is also his profession. Not bad for a book written for a popular audience, but not great. "

I also really liked the idea of temporary autism and it's safe to say that it got me interested to the extent of wanting to know more about it and I honestly won't mind a book dedicated to it. The book also touched upon Priming in good details compared to other similar books. A huge chunk of the book, and by that I mean >70% of it, were examples to the ""Fast Thinking"" process, or the Blink in this book's terms, and if you've been reading my reviews you should realize by this point that I really love stories as examples as long as I get my share (I go with big portions here) of facts, science, and evidence based info. I was forced to compare the ""Blink"" to ""Fast Thinking"" introduced in Thinking, Fast And Slow, where the author in the later provided a huge deal of facts along with the multiple examples. I didn't find this in blink, in fact, I felt it's a good support for ""System 1"" (a synonym for fast thinking in the book's terms) , read before or after it to provide deeper understanding of it, it that is wanted. It won't have satisfied me at all as a standalone (maybe cuz I read the other book before it?)Another thing, the writer seemed a bit unsure, although he did lean more towards one of the opinions. Apart from repeating himself (and the incidents) a couple of times, he fluctuated between trusting our blink or going with deliberate thinking. Overall, this was a good read and I'll recommend it to others ✨."
216,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1698621-amy,4,"Fascinating book! I would describe Blink as promoting self-awareness more than self-help. It's a captivating exploration of the ability of our unconscious minds to accurately(much of the time)read the world around us. The psychological studies featured offered refreshing evidence that it isn't always in our best interest to slow down and think rationally. I wouldn't base an investment strategy on Gladwell's ""thin-slicing"" methods, but when it comes to matters of life and death, love, trust and marriage, oh, and battle tactics, Blink makes a convincing argument to ""go with our gut."" "
217,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49049055-parth-agrawal,4,"An awesome choice of title first of all as it aptly highlights the direction in which the present day decision making process is going towards. With increasing complexity and requirement of multi tasking, decision making is that one quality that every one yearns for. But the travesty of the truth is that very few are there amongst us who really know the process of decision making. Well I used to think that you sit, process and decide. That's one method ofcourse. The other one that comes to my mind is you run, slip, dash and just pick one from the options available to you with just hope, and logic being the last thing, on your side. ;pAdding to the joy, various experimental findings have been highlighted in the book forming the crux of the fun which I won't disclose here as it'll rob you off the fun in it. IN the book, author explicitly says that decision making process actually has two approaches. The first one that i mentioned above involves comprehension, cognition and lot of data crunching leading to the conclusion. But the underlying assumption in this process is that you have an unlimited supply of time (which is hardly ever the case). The second one that i mentioned above is called rapid cognition and in a cursory glance it would seem to you as a random act. We pick an option under such circumstance only when we know that picking is compulsory and we would be better off with a wrong choice rather than with no choice at all. If someone picks the right one, losers instantaneously brand it as luck by chance. What if i told you that even behind your rapid cognition, there is a basis. There's reason that you chose a particular option and only that option amongst all the options. It has a direct relation with the memories and experiences that have created your subconscious since you have stepped foot on this planet.The best example of this can be seen in our own society. If some guy is seen with a tattoo, long hair, ostentatious clothes, our mind immediately forms an image of him as someone who's born with a silverspoon or has no regards for the life he is living, he must be arrogant, impertinent etc etc. Where do all these ideas come from? They are nothing more than what we have been fed into our minds repeatedly and on a daily basis. In India, the organisational hierarchy of the family leaves little room for individual thought process and as an aftermath, the habit of questioning and curiosity goes down the drain. Cultural practices as such, leads to the creation of these kind of biases and prejudices which in turn has brewed a great deal of hypocrisy in our generation as the same characteristics that I mentioned above becomes desirable to an individual and even after he/she attains it, he/she remains contemptuous of the practice as a whole because that's what he/she has been fed with. How often have we seen that a guy in public transport even if mistakenly outrages the modesty of a female passenger, the crowd goes berserk and thrash the guy presuming that he must have had bad intentions. His pleas and requests fall upon deaf ears as people have already taken a snap judgement and no amount of explanation can convince them otherwise. Talking about all this brings us to a very important question. Are we slaves to our snap judgments? Can't we break free the shackles of biases and prejudices? To answer this, it is important to know that there is one big similarity between our conscious and subconscious thinking process. Both of them can be trained and taught through repetitive exercises only. It might be possible for some of you to think that since subconscious decision making is a quick process, training it will also be likewise but it isn't. Author substantiates this claim by quoting instances in the book in which body guards, police officers are provided training of this sort in which they control their adrenaline rush by repeatedly practicing in high-stress situations in which they learn to control their heart-rates, resisting their brains to keep the amount of input from dropping which ultimately helps them to take judicious action in such situations. Thomas Hoving, a curator, says that:"" I try my best to create best first impressions of the people, activity or an object during my first interaction as I believe that our subconscious is an untapped source of abilities and possibilities and it can be educated and trained in a manner such that we harness it for the greater good and for all this to happen, I need to have a positive frame of mind for every new experience of life."" Do you agree? I most certainly do;);).   "

We are desperately lacking in the latter.” (So true! What good is all the world’s info at our fingertips if we don’t have the wisdom necessary to properly execute it?)
219,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627983-mahlon,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written yet another thought-provoking book. In Blink he postulates that often our first impressions or gut instincts are more likely to lead us to the the correct decision than if we spent a long time gathering information and weighing out the pros and cons of the particular situation. In other words, you should ""trust your gut"" In trademark Gladwell fashion he uses many entertaining stories and case studies to illustrate his points, while at the same time cautioning against trusting your first impressions too much. I don't think his arguments are as well articulated as those in The Tipping Point, but I'll leave that up to the individual reader to decide for themselves.My previous complaints about Gladwell's organization, and the repetition of his writing are still valid. I find reading the beginning of one of his chapters to be a very enjoyable experience, but by mid-chapter I usually find the going excruciatingly slow, and by the end I feel as if I've been wandering around the desert for days, and have finally found my way back to civilization. Despite these minor flaws, at the end of his books I always find myself excited as to what his next project might be, and eager to share his insights with others. "

The short subject studies that the author uses are interesting, easy to follow, and compelling evidence of his ""theory"" or study in first impressions. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sociology, psychology, or who spends a lot of time interacting with people. You will learn how and when to trust your ""gut feeling"" or first impressions of people, situations, and products. A great read!"

This book is the 6th one that I've read by this author. I didn't like it as much as some of his other books. It didn't have the same edge as the others. It did however have some of the same entertainment appeal, so 3 stars."

226,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explores the phenomenon he calls 'thin slicing'; the human ability to winnow out, in fractions of a second, salient facts from a mass of information and make a decision based on them. Something most of us do all the time without giving it much conscious thought – reading the facial expressions and body language of the people with whom we interact, walking down a busy street (or a quiet street late at night), our subconscious minds processing hundreds or even thousands of bits of information, deciding which few are important and making a judgement based on them.Gladwell illustrates his thesis using several extended examples. The first is relatively straight forward. In 1983 California's Getty museum was offered a 2500 year old Greek statue, a kouros, for $10 million. All the tests said it was genuine but several art experts, at first glance and without being able to say precisely why, knew it was a fake. He also tells the stories of how an ugly chair conquered the offices of the world, how we are all effected by racial conditioning, how Chicago's Cook County hospital improved diagnosis of heart attacks by removing a physician's knowledge from the process, how a commander using WWII technology defeated the combined might of the the US armed forces in the largest ever war game, and more.The author uses two main studies to demonstrate how this process of instant assessment works. John Gottman's 'love lab', where he gets couples to talk about a subject tangentially connected with their relationship and videos the exchange to bring out the non-verbal cues, and Paul Ekman, who is an expert of facial micro-expressions that last microseconds and over which we have no control (this latter also being the model for the excellent TV show Lie To Me with Tim Roth). Gladwell builds his argument convincingly and refers back to his examples frequently for both illustration and dramatic effect. Each example he uses shows a different facet of the Blink effect but also, and this is vital, how it can go wrong in certain circumstances.While it is quick, this subconscious ability does require a moment to work, and can be short circuited by rushing or by an overload of adrenaline. Another case study chillingly shows what can happen when our subconscious is not given the opportunity to work properly. In 1999 an unarmed, innocent man, Amadou Diallo, was shot 41 times in the entryway of his own New York apartment building, by four policemen. He shows how a lack of experience, over-hasty action and perhaps even the over-confidence of numbers allowed these policemen to fall back on crude stereotypes and allow an initial poor assessment to lead them down a tragic course of events.While Gladwell lauds the benefits of both listening to this subconscious supercomputer and developing the skills, in backing up the studies he constantly refers to the fact that this understanding has often been achieved by the exact opposite type of mentation – deliberate, analytical evaluation of evidence. This, along with the examples given, should show the reader that there are appropriate and inappropriate areas for this sort of thinking, although I can imagine some of the readership taking away only the face-value lesson of relying on first instincts and gut feelings. I would have liked to see a chapter on the abuse of these impressions, which is after all how con artists and frauds such as psychics operate. This could have been perhaps added into the chapter on Warren G. Harding, who was elected as US president because he was tall, handsome, masculine, dignified – and is considered by historians to be one of the worst presidents in US history. I want to take nothing away from this excellent book, however. It is superbly written, making excellent use of pacing and the storylines of the examples he uses to give the book structure. Malcolm Gladwell has a great style, authoritative and engaging, and he packs a great deal of both information and analysis into what is a quick, easy and enjoyable read."
227,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6738834-fay-al,4,"Most of us don't know how our decision making / thinking process works. Turns out we're on auto pilot more often than not. Imagine if you had to think routine tasks everyday: walking, manipulating basic objects, recognizing faces, language...etc that would be exhausting and would consume much needed energy.“The mind operates most efficiently by relegating a good deal of high-level, sophisticated thinking to the unconscious, just as a modern jetliner is able to fly on automatic pilot with little or no input from the human, ‘conscious’ pilot. The adaptive unconscious does an excellent job of sizing up the world, warning people of danger, setting goals, and initiating action in a sophisticated and efficient manner.”We think we fully control every decision, but that's only what your mind is leading you to believe..... what we think of as free will is largely an illusion: much of the time, we are simply operating on automatic pilot, and the way we think and act — and how well we think and act on the spur of the moment — are a lot more susceptible to outside influences than we realize.Well it turns out, it's not that straightforward or under our conscious control as much as we'd like it to be:Reading Blink enables one to have a better idea of how it all works and become aware of the biases/influences that cloud our judgment. And there's plenty of examples & experiments in the book that highlights our ""flawed judgment"". And I think what all of this also means is that we're vulnerable to anyone wishing to manipulate us given that they know how our minds work better than we do.One experiment mentioned in the book about facial expressions struck me as very interesting. The face is not just a projection of what we think and feel, it also works the other way around.They gathered a group of volunteers and hooked them up to monitors measuring their heart rate and body temperature — the physiological signals of such emotions as anger, sadness, and fear. Half of the volunteers were told to try to remember and relive a particularly stressful experience. The other half were simply shown how to create, on their faces, the expressions that corresponded to stressful emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear. The second group, the people who were acting, showed the same physiological responses, the same heightened heart rate and body temperature, as the first group.A few years later, a German team of psychologists conducted a similar study. They had a group of subjects look at cartoons, either while holding a pen between their lips — an action that made it impossible to contract either of the two major smiling muscles, the risorius and the zygomatic major — or while holding a pen clenched between their teeth, which had the opposite effect and forced them to smile. The people with the pen between their teeth found the cartoons much funnier. These findings may be hard to believe, because we take it as a given that first we experience an emotion, and then we may — or may not — express that emotion on our face. We think of the face as the residue of emotion. What this research showed, though, is that the process works in the opposite direction as well. Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process."
228,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028530-caron,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written a book about the power of first impressions (aka intuition/ your gut feeling). He provides a series of anecdotes about the process of first reactions including a tale about a forged ancient Greek statue at the Getty that some experts deemed as authentic and others classified as a fake upon sight. In another anecdote, he scrutinizes a ""couples lab"" where psychologist John Gottman determines if a matched pair will last the test of time by studying their conversation for 15 minutes - -he accurately predicts their fate about 90% of the time.Gladwell coins the term ""thin-slicing"" to capture these small snippets in time when a human judges a situation in an instant like a first date, hiring an employee, or meeting a new colleague. Human beings tend to take a first glance and ""thin-slice"" what they perceive through sight or interactions with the situation or individual. Rapid fire cognition is scary to many individuals and Gladwell believes that if ""we paid more attention to those fleeting moments...it would change the way wars are fought, the kinds of products we see on the shelves, the kinds of movies that get made, the way police officers are trained, the way couples are counseled...If you combine all those little changes together, you end up with a different and happier world."" How profound! He is attempting to bring psychology to the masses and does so artfully, choosing his words and sharping his ideas with high-interest examples to engage the reader. Gladwell further discusses ""priming,"" a term used to refer to subtle triggers that influence human behavior without any awareness of such changes (ex. Spain played classical music on subways and littering and vandalism decreased).The book incited much discussion with my book club membership- - thought provoking questions and topics selected from the Blink Reading Group Guide, but membership barely scratched the surface in their debate. This book caused the group to make many connections to their own lives and world. Conversation often digressed into self-reflective wondering or observations.Gladwell wants all readers to believe that intuition is often more reliable that reasoning and a series of data. But is that really the case? One criticism - he never addresses the brain in a scientific manner. In my own experience, I have learned (and am still learning) that I need to pay more attention to my intuition, my first gut instinct. I do not always think that ""thin-slicing"" is as reliable as collecting data and observations in many instances, but there is something to say about my first impressions of situations or people. I need to have more confidence about my ""gut impressions"" and have more faith in ME. Gladwell's book Blink substantiated that there is a certain degree of accuracy in my intuition. "
229,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5564285-sara-j-kefuwa,5,"This was the first Gladwell book I read. I read and finished it during my backpacking trip across Cambodia. I read it amongst the ruins of ancient temples, on bumpy dusty tuk-tuk rides, I held on to it while on the boat waiting for the freshwater dolphins to crest the surface of the mighty Mekong, I read it while sitting cross legged on the floor of the aisle of a public bus on the 2-hour ride back to Siem Reap.But even without all that hazy semi-sense-of-adventure-backpacking state of mind... I would still recommend this book to anyone. Or any of Mssr Gladwell's books honestly speaking (up to the date of this review I have read them all except for 'Tipping Point' and 'David & Goliath', ironically -or maybe rather quite properly Gladwellian- the first & latest of his books). In a nutshell, this book is about how intrinsically we know things. But how all that is usually drowned out or pushed to the corner of ones mind by a lot of good old crusty 'preconception', 'social upbringing' and 'societal brainwashing'. But maybe it's not something that comes when we think about it. Anyhow the main concept/theory in this book is not bedrock to be sure, but somewhat elastic. Something to be taken with a grain of salt. Just as relying too much on facts and proof takes the fun out of life, not caring at all about facts and proof takes out the foundations of sound character. Trust your gut, people. Trust your gut. But don't try too hard."
230,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38240230-dawn,4,"Audiobook read by the author. I'm going to keep this review short but I'm going to say it is an easy read and definitely worth reading. Basically, it is about the information our brains and subconscious process in the 'blink' of an eye. It's surprising how our subconscious knows what is happening in a scenario before we do. Gladwell provided many different scenarios and anecdotal stories throughout the book that were fascinating and eye-opening. It's sad to learn that we all are quick to judge and have many different stereotypes imbedded in our subconscious and conscious. The author's own anecdotal story of when he grew his hair out and the things that happened to him as a result is crazy. And he just had longer hair. So imagine all the other factors that play into someone's appearance and the quick judgements our subconscious starts to make. But this book isn't just about stereotypes. I also found the section on analyzing married couples fascinating. An expert (I forget his name) is able to 'thin slice' a couple's interaction with each other and can tell with 90% accuracy if they will stay married or not. Maybe this would be a good tool for counselors and therapists to learn before couples get married? Definitely recommend. 4 stars."
231,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,3,"I seem to be destined to be disappointed by every book that I pick up these days. Perhaps I am just in a reading funk, but this book, too, left me a bit unsatisfied. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but the book was essentially a series of anecdotes about instinct. Gladwell may call it ""thin-slicing"" but the book is really about making snap judgments, stereotyping, if you will. It's the judgment that we make in the first few seconds of an interaction, a judgment made in the ""blink"" of an eye. Often, if not always, these judgments are more true than the ones made with greater reflection and we ignore these ""thin-slices"" at our peril. That, in a nutshell (or a thin-slice), is the thesis of this book. It is an interesting theory and one that I find amicable. My personal experience seems to confirm it. Still, I would have liked to see the whole thing fleshed out just a bit more. It just seemed a bit lightweight overall, but interesting as pop science. "

I have to admit, in the first chapter I had a little knee-jerk reaction when I thought he was saying that our intuitive reactions are invariably correct. As I continued to read I appreciated his skill in outlining the complexity of his theory, and the fact that only one who is trained in a particular field can really articulate what is happening in his or her unconscious decision-making process. He also explained how that unconscious reaction can be skewed by unrelated factors, thus completely disproving my knee-jerk disagreement."

236,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178887-max-stone,3,"The general topic was how powerful our initial impressions are because we can process stuff really quick at a subconscious level in some cases. Blink was well written and pretty entertaining. I thought the author did a good job of coming up with interesting examples of good or bad information processing and I enjoyed reading those. However, aside from writing style and some fun examples, I thought the content was quite neatly separable into two parts:  (a) stuff that was interesting and seemed true and which I knew already, and  (b) stuff that seemed untrue or at least incoherant and that I hadn't previously heard before. but maybe that was just my closed mind at work. Examples of (a) were how you one's initial impression (lke in the first 5 seconds) of a teacher or an interviewee are pretty highly correlated with your opinion after an hour.There were lots of examples of (b). Like it was weird that one of his first and favorite examples was this guy who had studied videos of couples interacting in intense detail for decades, and had created a list for how someone could score such videos to predict odds that the marriage would last. It was supposed to be an example of ""blink"" processing because the expert could recognize it quickly, but to me it seemed more like the opposite since (1) non-experts (including the author) all had inaccurate instinctive reactions to watching the videos, and (2) the best way to get the right answer was a mechanical scorecard -- kind of the opposite of blink.And in general, there were examples of when you should trust your blink instinct and when that was wrong, but all the examples of when it was right or wrong seemed very post hoc (e.g. if your heart rate is over some threshold you shouldn't, but I don't think that would have come up unless he needed some explanation for why accidental police shootings occured), and he didn't really have a consistent framework for when it would be right or wrong, which made it kinda useless. and some seemed random, like the part about some musicians that musical experts liked but that did poorly in the musical equivalent of blind taste tests -- seemed likely that it was a friend of the author or some musician he liked (it was clear in the book that we should take as a given that it was a good musician and that the taste tests were wrong -- I was never quite clear why) and he was just trying to think of some way that might connect to his thesis.I liked the description of how orchestras started doing blind auditions to avoid discrimination against women. wasn't sure that it supported his thesis, but it was interesting. that was more or less my reaction to the whole book."

It has to do with trends: what makes something popular and who is involved in that process and why it works. This isn't a look at advertising or corporate businesses (although the does look at those, too) but rather a journey into the dynamics and parts of these trends. It's an intriguing and well written book, ideal for anyone who wants to know how social trends work. It has pracitcal applications as well, if you have any desire to make social changes yourself.""Blink"" is more on a personal level, and looks at how our subconcious works and how important it is in our daily life and daily choices. This book is amazing, and I highly recommend it for everyone. ""Tipping"" is really interesting and carries some amazing social insights, but only applies directly to those who wish to institute change, ""Blink"" on the other hand is a must-read for anyone who has ever wondered why they make the split-second decisions they make and whether they're good or bad. Which I hope is everyone. Malcolm Gladwell has an amazing way of writing as though he was chatting over a cup of coffee. His books are full of amazing insight, research, and profound ideas that revolutionize the world we live it, but there is never a point that you feel lost, like these ideas are only something the smart kids can truly understand. Another thing I truly enjoy is his absolute lack of preachieness. His opinions are strongly stated, but never forced on you."

But be careful, though, because: When we make a second split decision, we are also very vulnerable to being guided by our stereotypes and prejudices, even ones we may not necessarily endorse or believe.So what is the practical solution to make a split second decision? This ability improves with practice. Apparently, our unconscious thinking is no different from our conscious thinking: in both, we are able to develop our rapid decision making with training and experience.Probably one of the best psychology books that I’ve read.

240,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545336-mike,5,"Blink is an elegant 5 Star piece of science writing, dealing with how we think and chose in an instant. We make snap decisions based on experience or some other basis. Sometimes that is good and sometimes not. There are many good reviews so I am not going to spend more time on a review. What I will point out are two examples of how this book remains relevant today.First example is the recent campaign by Coca-Cola to sell specially colored white/silver cans of Coke over the 2011-2012 winter season to support “the plight of the polar bears.” Now, regardless of what you think about the motivation, the Cokeheads didn’t do their homework very well. In the book, Gladwell gives an example of a time 7-UP changed the shade of their green can and people complained that they had changed the taste. The 7-UP folks had simply changed the outside of the can, not the inside. Well, the very same thing happened to Coke. People started complaining the taste of regular Coke was different and sales started to go down. Well, astute businessmen that they are, the Cokies changed back to the normal red can ahead of schedule and sales went right back up, complaints went away. A simple reading of this book could have avoided this little mixup. (Coke continued the campaign to support the polar bears, or rather, the enviro’s who claim special concern over the bears plight).Another example is when I saw this principle in action. I was in the hospital recovery room after my son had an operation. A older couple was at another station as the wife was also recovering. One of the nurses offered her a soda and she asked for a Diet Coke. Well, the nurse reached into the small refrig and pulled out what looked like a Diet Coke but was really one of the special white/silver regular Coke cans. Only at the very last moment did the wife notice it wasn’t a diet drink. The thing is she is a diabetic and the sugary regular Coke would not have been good for her. Again, a brief glance resulted in a snap decision that could have been a real problem. Had the human factors folks at Coke read this book, maybe they would have noted this.I like Gladwell. He explains science simply and makes me feel smarter than I really am. Thanks dude."
241,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,4,"I've been listening to Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman while reading this book and the two are very closely related. I liked Blink more, so far. (Haven't completely finished the Kahneman one yet.) Gladwell is an excellent storyteller and, though he includes many scientific studies, Blink feels more approachable than Thinking Fast and Slow.The end result of reading back-to-back books on psychology that deal with our decision making processes and the problems/biases that we may have with them is that it has me doubting everything I've thought about or had to make a decision about for the past couple of days. I guess that's the sign of good literature, it makes you think and changes your worldview. While being slightly disturbed by all of this new input, I've also been wondering about how I can apply this new knowledge to its up-most potential.For example, I know within milliseconds of someone coming up to the reference desk, if the interaction I'm about to have with them is going to proceed smoothly or not. It's in their face, their pacing, if they're carrying something in their hands or not- I don't know how I know, I just know. From reading Gladwell's book, I think I do a combination of body language reading and then prime myself for whatever I think I've read in that glance about the person I'm about to deal with. Maybe I could prime myself to expect the best interaction for every experience? Maybe I could slow down the process of the gut check reaction? Anyway, this book taught me that I can do better and that perhaps I shouldn't rely on that immediate first impression to drive the rest of the action. Maybe I could set up a screen in front of my desk and then respond only to people's questions instead of how they're approaching me like how the interviewers removed the initial bias in the blind orchestral auditions... now there's an idea.If you enjoyed Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking then you may like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (more of a scientific approach to the same topic) or The Truth About Trust: How It Determines Success in Life, Love, Learning, and More by David DeSteno (mind blowing book, at least it was for me, on trust, and how we make our decisions to trust or not)."

I was impressed with all that was said in this book and am still thinking about why!!In the meantime, my husband stole my copy, so before I really get into why, I will have to steal it back!!I did listen to this book as well.

243,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65250-sheila,4,"This book was really interesting. It discusses the way in which people can ""thin-slice"" a situation in a matter of seconds and make a judgement. This is where pre-conceived notions such as stereotypes can affect the way we react to something under a time constraint. It's about how our unconscious mind figures things out and affects how we feel or affects our actions before we even realize what is happening. Even if you aren't a racist, you can be programmed to act as a racist by the things you are exposed to in society. Even if you don't think you are sexist, you are more sexist than you think, due to programming. We associate things like home with mother and work with father. Examined in the book are police brutality, predictions of whether a couple will stay together (just by examining 15 min. of conversation), reading facial expressions, how one firefighter was able to thin slice a situation so quickly that he was able to save his men.The study I found most interesting was the analysis of an autistic man. We have a part of our brain we use for facial recognition and another part we use for object recognition. The autistic man used the object part of his brain for both facial recognition and for things like recognizing that an object was a chair. The autistic man would watch a movie and not ""get"" the emotional things happening because he barely paid attention to faces and didn't distinguish meaning from them. A new police officer, for example, in a time of distress where his heart is racing, he just finished chasing a man in his car for an hour, will become ""autistic"" so to speak because he ignores all cues and shoots a man to death. All he perceives is a threat and he forgets the person. A police officer with more experience will be able to ""thin slice"" the situation better in a matter of seconds and avoid an unecessary shooting.In order to be a good ""thin-slicer"", you probably have a lot of experience with what you are examining and it just becomes second nature. Some people are just naturally good at reading faces, predicting outcomes, and making those snap decisions that happen in the blink of an eye. Others, well, not as good! I feel that the book could use more focus, but overall, a good read.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the mysterious ways our minds work. "
244,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,3,"Won't do my typical long review for this book. I'm actually writing something more substantial that deals with these issues, so I'll save some of my energy for that. (And there is quite a bit more that needs reading). The short-short version of my usual long review is that Gladwell has some very good exploratory writing that he has written through anecdotes. This shouldn't surprise Gladwell fans. The problem with this book is that we never know whether he is intervening in the art vs. science debate, the intuitive vs. structured methods debate, or the rationalist vs. heuristic learning debate. If we were to read the book through any of these perspectives, unsurprisingly, the answer would be -- it all depends. Intuition can be the answer -- unless it's the problem. Intuition can be made better, through science. Unless our science is actually the problem, in that case, trust expert judgement (not necessarily the same thing as intuition, right?). The concepts get fuzzy. And actually, it seems like Gladwell is taking liberties with his subject matter to explore a range of things that might only be slightly related. One might take away from this book that we need to be aware of our own cognition, or that we need something called an epistemological frame. How do we know what we know? When is information too much information? When do we need rigor? When do we need to make a decision quickly? In any case, we're not sure what we're supposed to take away because the book hasn't quite settled into a fuller version of itself. That is my intuition as a writer. Gladwell has a second or third draft, but not quite a final draft. And that final draft might be a little beyond his capabilities. He might need a co-author, more time, or expertise to help his cause. There is a deep literature that deals with all of these subjects of epistemology, analytical failure, art vs. science (and so on). But since the book scrapes the surface of applied psychology, we're left with a few good stories and some things to think about. One has to remember that the author is a journalist and kind of intellectual voyeur -- thin-slicing is not only one of the topics of his book, it is also his profession. Not bad for a book written for a popular audience, but not great. "
245,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43449419-rawa-a,3,"This is going to be a very interesting review ..I was introduced to this book through Thinking, Fast And Slow and was very excited to read it; the idea is brilliant, it dwells on one of my favorite topics in psychology, and who doesn't want to have a deeper understanding of their own thought processes?It started with the Kouros story which was a great choice in my opinion to start the book with. In retrospect, it kind of summarized the whole book in a story format. One of my fav. I also really liked the idea of temporary autism and it's safe to say that it got me interested to the extent of wanting to know more about it and I honestly won't mind a book dedicated to it. The book also touched upon Priming in good details compared to other similar books. A huge chunk of the book, and by that I mean >70% of it, were examples to the ""Fast Thinking"" process, or the Blink in this book's terms, and if you've been reading my reviews you should realize by this point that I really love stories as examples as long as I get my share (I go with big portions here) of facts, science, and evidence based info. I was forced to compare the ""Blink"" to ""Fast Thinking"" introduced in Thinking, Fast And Slow, where the author in the later provided a huge deal of facts along with the multiple examples. I didn't find this in blink, in fact, I felt it's a good support for ""System 1"" (a synonym for fast thinking in the book's terms) , read before or after it to provide deeper understanding of it, it that is wanted. It won't have satisfied me at all as a standalone (maybe cuz I read the other book before it?)Another thing, the writer seemed a bit unsure, although he did lean more towards one of the opinions. Apart from repeating himself (and the incidents) a couple of times, he fluctuated between trusting our blink or going with deliberate thinking. Overall, this was a good read and I'll recommend it to others ✨."
246,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1698621-amy,4,"Fascinating book! I would describe Blink as promoting self-awareness more than self-help. It's a captivating exploration of the ability of our unconscious minds to accurately(much of the time)read the world around us. The psychological studies featured offered refreshing evidence that it isn't always in our best interest to slow down and think rationally. I wouldn't base an investment strategy on Gladwell's ""thin-slicing"" methods, but when it comes to matters of life and death, love, trust and marriage, oh, and battle tactics, Blink makes a convincing argument to ""go with our gut."" "
247,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49049055-parth-agrawal,4,"An awesome choice of title first of all as it aptly highlights the direction in which the present day decision making process is going towards. With increasing complexity and requirement of multi tasking, decision making is that one quality that every one yearns for. But the travesty of the truth is that very few are there amongst us who really know the process of decision making. Well I used to think that you sit, process and decide. That's one method ofcourse. The other one that comes to my mind is you run, slip, dash and just pick one from the options available to you with just hope, and logic being the last thing, on your side. ;pAdding to the joy, various experimental findings have been highlighted in the book forming the crux of the fun which I won't disclose here as it'll rob you off the fun in it. IN the book, author explicitly says that decision making process actually has two approaches. The first one that i mentioned above involves comprehension, cognition and lot of data crunching leading to the conclusion. But the underlying assumption in this process is that you have an unlimited supply of time (which is hardly ever the case). The second one that i mentioned above is called rapid cognition and in a cursory glance it would seem to you as a random act. We pick an option under such circumstance only when we know that picking is compulsory and we would be better off with a wrong choice rather than with no choice at all. If someone picks the right one, losers instantaneously brand it as luck by chance. What if i told you that even behind your rapid cognition, there is a basis. There's reason that you chose a particular option and only that option amongst all the options. It has a direct relation with the memories and experiences that have created your subconscious since you have stepped foot on this planet.The best example of this can be seen in our own society. If some guy is seen with a tattoo, long hair, ostentatious clothes, our mind immediately forms an image of him as someone who's born with a silverspoon or has no regards for the life he is living, he must be arrogant, impertinent etc etc. Where do all these ideas come from? They are nothing more than what we have been fed into our minds repeatedly and on a daily basis. In India, the organisational hierarchy of the family leaves little room for individual thought process and as an aftermath, the habit of questioning and curiosity goes down the drain. Cultural practices as such, leads to the creation of these kind of biases and prejudices which in turn has brewed a great deal of hypocrisy in our generation as the same characteristics that I mentioned above becomes desirable to an individual and even after he/she attains it, he/she remains contemptuous of the practice as a whole because that's what he/she has been fed with. How often have we seen that a guy in public transport even if mistakenly outrages the modesty of a female passenger, the crowd goes berserk and thrash the guy presuming that he must have had bad intentions. His pleas and requests fall upon deaf ears as people have already taken a snap judgement and no amount of explanation can convince them otherwise. Talking about all this brings us to a very important question. Are we slaves to our snap judgments? Can't we break free the shackles of biases and prejudices? To answer this, it is important to know that there is one big similarity between our conscious and subconscious thinking process. Both of them can be trained and taught through repetitive exercises only. It might be possible for some of you to think that since subconscious decision making is a quick process, training it will also be likewise but it isn't. Author substantiates this claim by quoting instances in the book in which body guards, police officers are provided training of this sort in which they control their adrenaline rush by repeatedly practicing in high-stress situations in which they learn to control their heart-rates, resisting their brains to keep the amount of input from dropping which ultimately helps them to take judicious action in such situations. Thomas Hoving, a curator, says that:"" I try my best to create best first impressions of the people, activity or an object during my first interaction as I believe that our subconscious is an untapped source of abilities and possibilities and it can be educated and trained in a manner such that we harness it for the greater good and for all this to happen, I need to have a positive frame of mind for every new experience of life."" Do you agree? I most certainly do;);).   "

We are desperately lacking in the latter.” (So true! What good is all the world’s info at our fingertips if we don’t have the wisdom necessary to properly execute it?)
249,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627983-mahlon,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written yet another thought-provoking book. In Blink he postulates that often our first impressions or gut instincts are more likely to lead us to the the correct decision than if we spent a long time gathering information and weighing out the pros and cons of the particular situation. In other words, you should ""trust your gut"" In trademark Gladwell fashion he uses many entertaining stories and case studies to illustrate his points, while at the same time cautioning against trusting your first impressions too much. I don't think his arguments are as well articulated as those in The Tipping Point, but I'll leave that up to the individual reader to decide for themselves.My previous complaints about Gladwell's organization, and the repetition of his writing are still valid. I find reading the beginning of one of his chapters to be a very enjoyable experience, but by mid-chapter I usually find the going excruciatingly slow, and by the end I feel as if I've been wandering around the desert for days, and have finally found my way back to civilization. Despite these minor flaws, at the end of his books I always find myself excited as to what his next project might be, and eager to share his insights with others. "

You will learn how and when to trust your ""gut feeling"" or first impressions of people, situations, and products. A great read!"

256,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explores the phenomenon he calls 'thin slicing'; the human ability to winnow out, in fractions of a second, salient facts from a mass of information and make a decision based on them. Something most of us do all the time without giving it much conscious thought – reading the facial expressions and body language of the people with whom we interact, walking down a busy street (or a quiet street late at night), our subconscious minds processing hundreds or even thousands of bits of information, deciding which few are important and making a judgement based on them.Gladwell illustrates his thesis using several extended examples. The first is relatively straight forward. In 1983 California's Getty museum was offered a 2500 year old Greek statue, a kouros, for $10 million. All the tests said it was genuine but several art experts, at first glance and without being able to say precisely why, knew it was a fake. He also tells the stories of how an ugly chair conquered the offices of the world, how we are all effected by racial conditioning, how Chicago's Cook County hospital improved diagnosis of heart attacks by removing a physician's knowledge from the process, how a commander using WWII technology defeated the combined might of the the US armed forces in the largest ever war game, and more.The author uses two main studies to demonstrate how this process of instant assessment works. John Gottman's 'love lab', where he gets couples to talk about a subject tangentially connected with their relationship and videos the exchange to bring out the non-verbal cues, and Paul Ekman, who is an expert of facial micro-expressions that last microseconds and over which we have no control (this latter also being the model for the excellent TV show Lie To Me with Tim Roth). Gladwell builds his argument convincingly and refers back to his examples frequently for both illustration and dramatic effect. Each example he uses shows a different facet of the Blink effect but also, and this is vital, how it can go wrong in certain circumstances.While it is quick, this subconscious ability does require a moment to work, and can be short circuited by rushing or by an overload of adrenaline. Another case study chillingly shows what can happen when our subconscious is not given the opportunity to work properly. In 1999 an unarmed, innocent man, Amadou Diallo, was shot 41 times in the entryway of his own New York apartment building, by four policemen. He shows how a lack of experience, over-hasty action and perhaps even the over-confidence of numbers allowed these policemen to fall back on crude stereotypes and allow an initial poor assessment to lead them down a tragic course of events.While Gladwell lauds the benefits of both listening to this subconscious supercomputer and developing the skills, in backing up the studies he constantly refers to the fact that this understanding has often been achieved by the exact opposite type of mentation – deliberate, analytical evaluation of evidence. This, along with the examples given, should show the reader that there are appropriate and inappropriate areas for this sort of thinking, although I can imagine some of the readership taking away only the face-value lesson of relying on first instincts and gut feelings. I would have liked to see a chapter on the abuse of these impressions, which is after all how con artists and frauds such as psychics operate. This could have been perhaps added into the chapter on Warren G. Harding, who was elected as US president because he was tall, handsome, masculine, dignified – and is considered by historians to be one of the worst presidents in US history. I want to take nothing away from this excellent book, however. It is superbly written, making excellent use of pacing and the storylines of the examples he uses to give the book structure. Malcolm Gladwell has a great style, authoritative and engaging, and he packs a great deal of both information and analysis into what is a quick, easy and enjoyable read."
257,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6738834-fay-al,4,"Most of us don't know how our decision making / thinking process works. Turns out we're on auto pilot more often than not. Imagine if you had to think routine tasks everyday: walking, manipulating basic objects, recognizing faces, language...etc that would be exhausting and would consume much needed energy.“The mind operates most efficiently by relegating a good deal of high-level, sophisticated thinking to the unconscious, just as a modern jetliner is able to fly on automatic pilot with little or no input from the human, ‘conscious’ pilot. The adaptive unconscious does an excellent job of sizing up the world, warning people of danger, setting goals, and initiating action in a sophisticated and efficient manner.”We think we fully control every decision, but that's only what your mind is leading you to believe..... what we think of as free will is largely an illusion: much of the time, we are simply operating on automatic pilot, and the way we think and act — and how well we think and act on the spur of the moment — are a lot more susceptible to outside influences than we realize.Well it turns out, it's not that straightforward or under our conscious control as much as we'd like it to be:Reading Blink enables one to have a better idea of how it all works and become aware of the biases/influences that cloud our judgment. And there's plenty of examples & experiments in the book that highlights our ""flawed judgment"". And I think what all of this also means is that we're vulnerable to anyone wishing to manipulate us given that they know how our minds work better than we do.One experiment mentioned in the book about facial expressions struck me as very interesting. The face is not just a projection of what we think and feel, it also works the other way around.They gathered a group of volunteers and hooked them up to monitors measuring their heart rate and body temperature — the physiological signals of such emotions as anger, sadness, and fear. Half of the volunteers were told to try to remember and relive a particularly stressful experience. The other half were simply shown how to create, on their faces, the expressions that corresponded to stressful emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear. The second group, the people who were acting, showed the same physiological responses, the same heightened heart rate and body temperature, as the first group.A few years later, a German team of psychologists conducted a similar study. They had a group of subjects look at cartoons, either while holding a pen between their lips — an action that made it impossible to contract either of the two major smiling muscles, the risorius and the zygomatic major — or while holding a pen clenched between their teeth, which had the opposite effect and forced them to smile. The people with the pen between their teeth found the cartoons much funnier. These findings may be hard to believe, because we take it as a given that first we experience an emotion, and then we may — or may not — express that emotion on our face. We think of the face as the residue of emotion. What this research showed, though, is that the process works in the opposite direction as well. Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process."
258,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028530-caron,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written a book about the power of first impressions (aka intuition/ your gut feeling). He provides a series of anecdotes about the process of first reactions including a tale about a forged ancient Greek statue at the Getty that some experts deemed as authentic and others classified as a fake upon sight. In another anecdote, he scrutinizes a ""couples lab"" where psychologist John Gottman determines if a matched pair will last the test of time by studying their conversation for 15 minutes - -he accurately predicts their fate about 90% of the time.Gladwell coins the term ""thin-slicing"" to capture these small snippets in time when a human judges a situation in an instant like a first date, hiring an employee, or meeting a new colleague. Human beings tend to take a first glance and ""thin-slice"" what they perceive through sight or interactions with the situation or individual. Rapid fire cognition is scary to many individuals and Gladwell believes that if ""we paid more attention to those fleeting moments...it would change the way wars are fought, the kinds of products we see on the shelves, the kinds of movies that get made, the way police officers are trained, the way couples are counseled...If you combine all those little changes together, you end up with a different and happier world."" How profound! He is attempting to bring psychology to the masses and does so artfully, choosing his words and sharping his ideas with high-interest examples to engage the reader. Gladwell further discusses ""priming,"" a term used to refer to subtle triggers that influence human behavior without any awareness of such changes (ex. Spain played classical music on subways and littering and vandalism decreased).The book incited much discussion with my book club membership- - thought provoking questions and topics selected from the Blink Reading Group Guide, but membership barely scratched the surface in their debate. This book caused the group to make many connections to their own lives and world. Conversation often digressed into self-reflective wondering or observations.Gladwell wants all readers to believe that intuition is often more reliable that reasoning and a series of data. But is that really the case? One criticism - he never addresses the brain in a scientific manner. In my own experience, I have learned (and am still learning) that I need to pay more attention to my intuition, my first gut instinct. I do not always think that ""thin-slicing"" is as reliable as collecting data and observations in many instances, but there is something to say about my first impressions of situations or people. I need to have more confidence about my ""gut impressions"" and have more faith in ME. Gladwell's book Blink substantiated that there is a certain degree of accuracy in my intuition. "
259,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5564285-sara-j-kefuwa,5,"This was the first Gladwell book I read. I read and finished it during my backpacking trip across Cambodia. I read it amongst the ruins of ancient temples, on bumpy dusty tuk-tuk rides, I held on to it while on the boat waiting for the freshwater dolphins to crest the surface of the mighty Mekong, I read it while sitting cross legged on the floor of the aisle of a public bus on the 2-hour ride back to Siem Reap.But even without all that hazy semi-sense-of-adventure-backpacking state of mind... I would still recommend this book to anyone. Or any of Mssr Gladwell's books honestly speaking (up to the date of this review I have read them all except for 'Tipping Point' and 'David & Goliath', ironically -or maybe rather quite properly Gladwellian- the first & latest of his books). In a nutshell, this book is about how intrinsically we know things. But how all that is usually drowned out or pushed to the corner of ones mind by a lot of good old crusty 'preconception', 'social upbringing' and 'societal brainwashing'. But maybe it's not something that comes when we think about it. Anyhow the main concept/theory in this book is not bedrock to be sure, but somewhat elastic. Something to be taken with a grain of salt. Just as relying too much on facts and proof takes the fun out of life, not caring at all about facts and proof takes out the foundations of sound character. Trust your gut, people. Trust your gut. But don't try too hard."
260,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38240230-dawn,4,"Audiobook read by the author. I'm going to keep this review short but I'm going to say it is an easy read and definitely worth reading. Basically, it is about the information our brains and subconscious process in the 'blink' of an eye. It's surprising how our subconscious knows what is happening in a scenario before we do. Gladwell provided many different scenarios and anecdotal stories throughout the book that were fascinating and eye-opening. It's sad to learn that we all are quick to judge and have many different stereotypes imbedded in our subconscious and conscious. The author's own anecdotal story of when he grew his hair out and the things that happened to him as a result is crazy. And he just had longer hair. So imagine all the other factors that play into someone's appearance and the quick judgements our subconscious starts to make. But this book isn't just about stereotypes. I also found the section on analyzing married couples fascinating. An expert (I forget his name) is able to 'thin slice' a couple's interaction with each other and can tell with 90% accuracy if they will stay married or not. Maybe this would be a good tool for counselors and therapists to learn before couples get married? Definitely recommend. 4 stars."
261,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,3,"I seem to be destined to be disappointed by every book that I pick up these days. Perhaps I am just in a reading funk, but this book, too, left me a bit unsatisfied. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but the book was essentially a series of anecdotes about instinct. Gladwell may call it ""thin-slicing"" but the book is really about making snap judgments, stereotyping, if you will. It's the judgment that we make in the first few seconds of an interaction, a judgment made in the ""blink"" of an eye. Often, if not always, these judgments are more true than the ones made with greater reflection and we ignore these ""thin-slices"" at our peril. That, in a nutshell (or a thin-slice), is the thesis of this book. It is an interesting theory and one that I find amicable. My personal experience seems to confirm it. Still, I would have liked to see the whole thing fleshed out just a bit more. It just seemed a bit lightweight overall, but interesting as pop science. "
262,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1595511-kiri,5,"Fascinating! I have to admit, in the first chapter I had a little knee-jerk reaction when I thought he was saying that our intuitive reactions are invariably correct. As I continued to read I appreciated his skill in outlining the complexity of his theory, and the fact that only one who is trained in a particular field can really articulate what is happening in his or her unconscious decision-making process. He also explained how that unconscious reaction can be skewed by unrelated factors, thus completely disproving my knee-jerk disagreement."

266,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178887-max-stone,3,"The general topic was how powerful our initial impressions are because we can process stuff really quick at a subconscious level in some cases. Blink was well written and pretty entertaining. I thought the author did a good job of coming up with interesting examples of good or bad information processing and I enjoyed reading those. However, aside from writing style and some fun examples, I thought the content was quite neatly separable into two parts:  (a) stuff that was interesting and seemed true and which I knew already, and  (b) stuff that seemed untrue or at least incoherant and that I hadn't previously heard before. but maybe that was just my closed mind at work. Examples of (a) were how you one's initial impression (lke in the first 5 seconds) of a teacher or an interviewee are pretty highly correlated with your opinion after an hour.There were lots of examples of (b). Like it was weird that one of his first and favorite examples was this guy who had studied videos of couples interacting in intense detail for decades, and had created a list for how someone could score such videos to predict odds that the marriage would last. It was supposed to be an example of ""blink"" processing because the expert could recognize it quickly, but to me it seemed more like the opposite since (1) non-experts (including the author) all had inaccurate instinctive reactions to watching the videos, and (2) the best way to get the right answer was a mechanical scorecard -- kind of the opposite of blink.And in general, there were examples of when you should trust your blink instinct and when that was wrong, but all the examples of when it was right or wrong seemed very post hoc (e.g. if your heart rate is over some threshold you shouldn't, but I don't think that would have come up unless he needed some explanation for why accidental police shootings occured), and he didn't really have a consistent framework for when it would be right or wrong, which made it kinda useless. and some seemed random, like the part about some musicians that musical experts liked but that did poorly in the musical equivalent of blind taste tests -- seemed likely that it was a friend of the author or some musician he liked (it was clear in the book that we should take as a given that it was a good musician and that the taste tests were wrong -- I was never quite clear why) and he was just trying to think of some way that might connect to his thesis.I liked the description of how orchestras started doing blind auditions to avoid discrimination against women. wasn't sure that it supported his thesis, but it was interesting. that was more or less my reaction to the whole book."

It has to do with trends: what makes something popular and who is involved in that process and why it works. This isn't a look at advertising or corporate businesses (although the does look at those, too) but rather a journey into the dynamics and parts of these trends. It's an intriguing and well written book, ideal for anyone who wants to know how social trends work. It has pracitcal applications as well, if you have any desire to make social changes yourself.""Blink"" is more on a personal level, and looks at how our subconcious works and how important it is in our daily life and daily choices. This book is amazing, and I highly recommend it for everyone. ""Tipping"" is really interesting and carries some amazing social insights, but only applies directly to those who wish to institute change, ""Blink"" on the other hand is a must-read for anyone who has ever wondered why they make the split-second decisions they make and whether they're good or bad. Which I hope is everyone. Malcolm Gladwell has an amazing way of writing as though he was chatting over a cup of coffee. His books are full of amazing insight, research, and profound ideas that revolutionize the world we live it, but there is never a point that you feel lost, like these ideas are only something the smart kids can truly understand. Another thing I truly enjoy is his absolute lack of preachieness. His opinions are strongly stated, but never forced on you."

But be careful, though, because: When we make a second split decision, we are also very vulnerable to being guided by our stereotypes and prejudices, even ones we may not necessarily endorse or believe.So what is the practical solution to make a split second decision? This ability improves with practice. Apparently, our unconscious thinking is no different from our conscious thinking: in both, we are able to develop our rapid decision making with training and experience.Probably one of the best psychology books that I’ve read.

270,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545336-mike,5,"Blink is an elegant 5 Star piece of science writing, dealing with how we think and chose in an instant. We make snap decisions based on experience or some other basis. Sometimes that is good and sometimes not. There are many good reviews so I am not going to spend more time on a review. What I will point out are two examples of how this book remains relevant today.First example is the recent campaign by Coca-Cola to sell specially colored white/silver cans of Coke over the 2011-2012 winter season to support “the plight of the polar bears.” Now, regardless of what you think about the motivation, the Cokeheads didn’t do their homework very well. In the book, Gladwell gives an example of a time 7-UP changed the shade of their green can and people complained that they had changed the taste. The 7-UP folks had simply changed the outside of the can, not the inside. Well, the very same thing happened to Coke. People started complaining the taste of regular Coke was different and sales started to go down. Well, astute businessmen that they are, the Cokies changed back to the normal red can ahead of schedule and sales went right back up, complaints went away. A simple reading of this book could have avoided this little mixup. (Coke continued the campaign to support the polar bears, or rather, the enviro’s who claim special concern over the bears plight).Another example is when I saw this principle in action. I was in the hospital recovery room after my son had an operation. A older couple was at another station as the wife was also recovering. One of the nurses offered her a soda and she asked for a Diet Coke. Well, the nurse reached into the small refrig and pulled out what looked like a Diet Coke but was really one of the special white/silver regular Coke cans. Only at the very last moment did the wife notice it wasn’t a diet drink. The thing is she is a diabetic and the sugary regular Coke would not have been good for her. Again, a brief glance resulted in a snap decision that could have been a real problem. Had the human factors folks at Coke read this book, maybe they would have noted this.I like Gladwell. He explains science simply and makes me feel smarter than I really am. Thanks dude."
271,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,4,"I've been listening to Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman while reading this book and the two are very closely related. I liked Blink more, so far. (Haven't completely finished the Kahneman one yet.) Gladwell is an excellent storyteller and, though he includes many scientific studies, Blink feels more approachable than Thinking Fast and Slow.The end result of reading back-to-back books on psychology that deal with our decision making processes and the problems/biases that we may have with them is that it has me doubting everything I've thought about or had to make a decision about for the past couple of days. I guess that's the sign of good literature, it makes you think and changes your worldview. While being slightly disturbed by all of this new input, I've also been wondering about how I can apply this new knowledge to its up-most potential.For example, I know within milliseconds of someone coming up to the reference desk, if the interaction I'm about to have with them is going to proceed smoothly or not. It's in their face, their pacing, if they're carrying something in their hands or not- I don't know how I know, I just know. From reading Gladwell's book, I think I do a combination of body language reading and then prime myself for whatever I think I've read in that glance about the person I'm about to deal with. Maybe I could prime myself to expect the best interaction for every experience? Maybe I could slow down the process of the gut check reaction? Anyway, this book taught me that I can do better and that perhaps I shouldn't rely on that immediate first impression to drive the rest of the action. Maybe I could set up a screen in front of my desk and then respond only to people's questions instead of how they're approaching me like how the interviewers removed the initial bias in the blind orchestral auditions... now there's an idea.If you enjoyed Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking then you may like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (more of a scientific approach to the same topic) or The Truth About Trust: How It Determines Success in Life, Love, Learning, and More by David DeSteno (mind blowing book, at least it was for me, on trust, and how we make our decisions to trust or not)."

273,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65250-sheila,4,"This book was really interesting. It discusses the way in which people can ""thin-slice"" a situation in a matter of seconds and make a judgement. This is where pre-conceived notions such as stereotypes can affect the way we react to something under a time constraint. It's about how our unconscious mind figures things out and affects how we feel or affects our actions before we even realize what is happening. Even if you aren't a racist, you can be programmed to act as a racist by the things you are exposed to in society. Even if you don't think you are sexist, you are more sexist than you think, due to programming. We associate things like home with mother and work with father. Examined in the book are police brutality, predictions of whether a couple will stay together (just by examining 15 min. of conversation), reading facial expressions, how one firefighter was able to thin slice a situation so quickly that he was able to save his men.The study I found most interesting was the analysis of an autistic man. We have a part of our brain we use for facial recognition and another part we use for object recognition. The autistic man used the object part of his brain for both facial recognition and for things like recognizing that an object was a chair. The autistic man would watch a movie and not ""get"" the emotional things happening because he barely paid attention to faces and didn't distinguish meaning from them. A new police officer, for example, in a time of distress where his heart is racing, he just finished chasing a man in his car for an hour, will become ""autistic"" so to speak because he ignores all cues and shoots a man to death. All he perceives is a threat and he forgets the person. A police officer with more experience will be able to ""thin slice"" the situation better in a matter of seconds and avoid an unecessary shooting.In order to be a good ""thin-slicer"", you probably have a lot of experience with what you are examining and it just becomes second nature. Some people are just naturally good at reading faces, predicting outcomes, and making those snap decisions that happen in the blink of an eye. Others, well, not as good! I feel that the book could use more focus, but overall, a good read.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the mysterious ways our minds work. "
274,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,3,"Won't do my typical long review for this book. I'm actually writing something more substantial that deals with these issues, so I'll save some of my energy for that. (And there is quite a bit more that needs reading). The short-short version of my usual long review is that Gladwell has some very good exploratory writing that he has written through anecdotes. This shouldn't surprise Gladwell fans. The problem with this book is that we never know whether he is intervening in the art vs. science debate, the intuitive vs. structured methods debate, or the rationalist vs. heuristic learning debate. If we were to read the book through any of these perspectives, unsurprisingly, the answer would be -- it all depends. Intuition can be the answer -- unless it's the problem. Intuition can be made better, through science. Unless our science is actually the problem, in that case, trust expert judgement (not necessarily the same thing as intuition, right?). The concepts get fuzzy. And actually, it seems like Gladwell is taking liberties with his subject matter to explore a range of things that might only be slightly related. One might take away from this book that we need to be aware of our own cognition, or that we need something called an epistemological frame. How do we know what we know? When is information too much information? When do we need rigor? When do we need to make a decision quickly? In any case, we're not sure what we're supposed to take away because the book hasn't quite settled into a fuller version of itself. That is my intuition as a writer. Gladwell has a second or third draft, but not quite a final draft. And that final draft might be a little beyond his capabilities. He might need a co-author, more time, or expertise to help his cause. There is a deep literature that deals with all of these subjects of epistemology, analytical failure, art vs. science (and so on). But since the book scrapes the surface of applied psychology, we're left with a few good stories and some things to think about. One has to remember that the author is a journalist and kind of intellectual voyeur -- thin-slicing is not only one of the topics of his book, it is also his profession. Not bad for a book written for a popular audience, but not great. "
275,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43449419-rawa-a,3,"This is going to be a very interesting review ..I was introduced to this book through Thinking, Fast And Slow and was very excited to read it; the idea is brilliant, it dwells on one of my favorite topics in psychology, and who doesn't want to have a deeper understanding of their own thought processes?It started with the Kouros story which was a great choice in my opinion to start the book with. In retrospect, it kind of summarized the whole book in a story format. One of my fav. I also really liked the idea of temporary autism and it's safe to say that it got me interested to the extent of wanting to know more about it and I honestly won't mind a book dedicated to it. The book also touched upon Priming in good details compared to other similar books. A huge chunk of the book, and by that I mean >70% of it, were examples to the ""Fast Thinking"" process, or the Blink in this book's terms, and if you've been reading my reviews you should realize by this point that I really love stories as examples as long as I get my share (I go with big portions here) of facts, science, and evidence based info. I was forced to compare the ""Blink"" to ""Fast Thinking"" introduced in Thinking, Fast And Slow, where the author in the later provided a huge deal of facts along with the multiple examples. I didn't find this in blink, in fact, I felt it's a good support for ""System 1"" (a synonym for fast thinking in the book's terms) , read before or after it to provide deeper understanding of it, it that is wanted. It won't have satisfied me at all as a standalone (maybe cuz I read the other book before it?)Another thing, the writer seemed a bit unsure, although he did lean more towards one of the opinions. Apart from repeating himself (and the incidents) a couple of times, he fluctuated between trusting our blink or going with deliberate thinking. Overall, this was a good read and I'll recommend it to others ✨."
276,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1698621-amy,4,"Fascinating book! I would describe Blink as promoting self-awareness more than self-help. It's a captivating exploration of the ability of our unconscious minds to accurately(much of the time)read the world around us. The psychological studies featured offered refreshing evidence that it isn't always in our best interest to slow down and think rationally. I wouldn't base an investment strategy on Gladwell's ""thin-slicing"" methods, but when it comes to matters of life and death, love, trust and marriage, oh, and battle tactics, Blink makes a convincing argument to ""go with our gut."" "
277,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49049055-parth-agrawal,4,"An awesome choice of title first of all as it aptly highlights the direction in which the present day decision making process is going towards. With increasing complexity and requirement of multi tasking, decision making is that one quality that every one yearns for. But the travesty of the truth is that very few are there amongst us who really know the process of decision making. Well I used to think that you sit, process and decide. That's one method ofcourse. The other one that comes to my mind is you run, slip, dash and just pick one from the options available to you with just hope, and logic being the last thing, on your side. ;pAdding to the joy, various experimental findings have been highlighted in the book forming the crux of the fun which I won't disclose here as it'll rob you off the fun in it. IN the book, author explicitly says that decision making process actually has two approaches. The first one that i mentioned above involves comprehension, cognition and lot of data crunching leading to the conclusion. But the underlying assumption in this process is that you have an unlimited supply of time (which is hardly ever the case). The second one that i mentioned above is called rapid cognition and in a cursory glance it would seem to you as a random act. We pick an option under such circumstance only when we know that picking is compulsory and we would be better off with a wrong choice rather than with no choice at all. If someone picks the right one, losers instantaneously brand it as luck by chance. What if i told you that even behind your rapid cognition, there is a basis. There's reason that you chose a particular option and only that option amongst all the options. It has a direct relation with the memories and experiences that have created your subconscious since you have stepped foot on this planet.The best example of this can be seen in our own society. If some guy is seen with a tattoo, long hair, ostentatious clothes, our mind immediately forms an image of him as someone who's born with a silverspoon or has no regards for the life he is living, he must be arrogant, impertinent etc etc. Where do all these ideas come from? They are nothing more than what we have been fed into our minds repeatedly and on a daily basis. In India, the organisational hierarchy of the family leaves little room for individual thought process and as an aftermath, the habit of questioning and curiosity goes down the drain. Cultural practices as such, leads to the creation of these kind of biases and prejudices which in turn has brewed a great deal of hypocrisy in our generation as the same characteristics that I mentioned above becomes desirable to an individual and even after he/she attains it, he/she remains contemptuous of the practice as a whole because that's what he/she has been fed with. How often have we seen that a guy in public transport even if mistakenly outrages the modesty of a female passenger, the crowd goes berserk and thrash the guy presuming that he must have had bad intentions. His pleas and requests fall upon deaf ears as people have already taken a snap judgement and no amount of explanation can convince them otherwise. Talking about all this brings us to a very important question. Are we slaves to our snap judgments? Can't we break free the shackles of biases and prejudices? To answer this, it is important to know that there is one big similarity between our conscious and subconscious thinking process. Both of them can be trained and taught through repetitive exercises only. It might be possible for some of you to think that since subconscious decision making is a quick process, training it will also be likewise but it isn't. Author substantiates this claim by quoting instances in the book in which body guards, police officers are provided training of this sort in which they control their adrenaline rush by repeatedly practicing in high-stress situations in which they learn to control their heart-rates, resisting their brains to keep the amount of input from dropping which ultimately helps them to take judicious action in such situations. Thomas Hoving, a curator, says that:"" I try my best to create best first impressions of the people, activity or an object during my first interaction as I believe that our subconscious is an untapped source of abilities and possibilities and it can be educated and trained in a manner such that we harness it for the greater good and for all this to happen, I need to have a positive frame of mind for every new experience of life."" Do you agree? I most certainly do;);).   "

279,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627983-mahlon,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written yet another thought-provoking book. In Blink he postulates that often our first impressions or gut instincts are more likely to lead us to the the correct decision than if we spent a long time gathering information and weighing out the pros and cons of the particular situation. In other words, you should ""trust your gut"" In trademark Gladwell fashion he uses many entertaining stories and case studies to illustrate his points, while at the same time cautioning against trusting your first impressions too much. I don't think his arguments are as well articulated as those in The Tipping Point, but I'll leave that up to the individual reader to decide for themselves.My previous complaints about Gladwell's organization, and the repetition of his writing are still valid. I find reading the beginning of one of his chapters to be a very enjoyable experience, but by mid-chapter I usually find the going excruciatingly slow, and by the end I feel as if I've been wandering around the desert for days, and have finally found my way back to civilization. Despite these minor flaws, at the end of his books I always find myself excited as to what his next project might be, and eager to share his insights with others. "

286,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explores the phenomenon he calls 'thin slicing'; the human ability to winnow out, in fractions of a second, salient facts from a mass of information and make a decision based on them. Something most of us do all the time without giving it much conscious thought – reading the facial expressions and body language of the people with whom we interact, walking down a busy street (or a quiet street late at night), our subconscious minds processing hundreds or even thousands of bits of information, deciding which few are important and making a judgement based on them.Gladwell illustrates his thesis using several extended examples. The first is relatively straight forward. In 1983 California's Getty museum was offered a 2500 year old Greek statue, a kouros, for $10 million. All the tests said it was genuine but several art experts, at first glance and without being able to say precisely why, knew it was a fake. He also tells the stories of how an ugly chair conquered the offices of the world, how we are all effected by racial conditioning, how Chicago's Cook County hospital improved diagnosis of heart attacks by removing a physician's knowledge from the process, how a commander using WWII technology defeated the combined might of the the US armed forces in the largest ever war game, and more.The author uses two main studies to demonstrate how this process of instant assessment works. John Gottman's 'love lab', where he gets couples to talk about a subject tangentially connected with their relationship and videos the exchange to bring out the non-verbal cues, and Paul Ekman, who is an expert of facial micro-expressions that last microseconds and over which we have no control (this latter also being the model for the excellent TV show Lie To Me with Tim Roth). Gladwell builds his argument convincingly and refers back to his examples frequently for both illustration and dramatic effect. Each example he uses shows a different facet of the Blink effect but also, and this is vital, how it can go wrong in certain circumstances.While it is quick, this subconscious ability does require a moment to work, and can be short circuited by rushing or by an overload of adrenaline. Another case study chillingly shows what can happen when our subconscious is not given the opportunity to work properly. In 1999 an unarmed, innocent man, Amadou Diallo, was shot 41 times in the entryway of his own New York apartment building, by four policemen. He shows how a lack of experience, over-hasty action and perhaps even the over-confidence of numbers allowed these policemen to fall back on crude stereotypes and allow an initial poor assessment to lead them down a tragic course of events.While Gladwell lauds the benefits of both listening to this subconscious supercomputer and developing the skills, in backing up the studies he constantly refers to the fact that this understanding has often been achieved by the exact opposite type of mentation – deliberate, analytical evaluation of evidence. This, along with the examples given, should show the reader that there are appropriate and inappropriate areas for this sort of thinking, although I can imagine some of the readership taking away only the face-value lesson of relying on first instincts and gut feelings. I would have liked to see a chapter on the abuse of these impressions, which is after all how con artists and frauds such as psychics operate. This could have been perhaps added into the chapter on Warren G. Harding, who was elected as US president because he was tall, handsome, masculine, dignified – and is considered by historians to be one of the worst presidents in US history. I want to take nothing away from this excellent book, however. It is superbly written, making excellent use of pacing and the storylines of the examples he uses to give the book structure. Malcolm Gladwell has a great style, authoritative and engaging, and he packs a great deal of both information and analysis into what is a quick, easy and enjoyable read."
287,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6738834-fay-al,4,"Most of us don't know how our decision making / thinking process works. Turns out we're on auto pilot more often than not. Imagine if you had to think routine tasks everyday: walking, manipulating basic objects, recognizing faces, language...etc that would be exhausting and would consume much needed energy.“The mind operates most efficiently by relegating a good deal of high-level, sophisticated thinking to the unconscious, just as a modern jetliner is able to fly on automatic pilot with little or no input from the human, ‘conscious’ pilot. The adaptive unconscious does an excellent job of sizing up the world, warning people of danger, setting goals, and initiating action in a sophisticated and efficient manner.”We think we fully control every decision, but that's only what your mind is leading you to believe..... what we think of as free will is largely an illusion: much of the time, we are simply operating on automatic pilot, and the way we think and act — and how well we think and act on the spur of the moment — are a lot more susceptible to outside influences than we realize.Well it turns out, it's not that straightforward or under our conscious control as much as we'd like it to be:Reading Blink enables one to have a better idea of how it all works and become aware of the biases/influences that cloud our judgment. And there's plenty of examples & experiments in the book that highlights our ""flawed judgment"". And I think what all of this also means is that we're vulnerable to anyone wishing to manipulate us given that they know how our minds work better than we do.One experiment mentioned in the book about facial expressions struck me as very interesting. The face is not just a projection of what we think and feel, it also works the other way around.They gathered a group of volunteers and hooked them up to monitors measuring their heart rate and body temperature — the physiological signals of such emotions as anger, sadness, and fear. Half of the volunteers were told to try to remember and relive a particularly stressful experience. The other half were simply shown how to create, on their faces, the expressions that corresponded to stressful emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear. The second group, the people who were acting, showed the same physiological responses, the same heightened heart rate and body temperature, as the first group.A few years later, a German team of psychologists conducted a similar study. They had a group of subjects look at cartoons, either while holding a pen between their lips — an action that made it impossible to contract either of the two major smiling muscles, the risorius and the zygomatic major — or while holding a pen clenched between their teeth, which had the opposite effect and forced them to smile. The people with the pen between their teeth found the cartoons much funnier. These findings may be hard to believe, because we take it as a given that first we experience an emotion, and then we may — or may not — express that emotion on our face. We think of the face as the residue of emotion. What this research showed, though, is that the process works in the opposite direction as well. Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process."
288,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028530-caron,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written a book about the power of first impressions (aka intuition/ your gut feeling). He provides a series of anecdotes about the process of first reactions including a tale about a forged ancient Greek statue at the Getty that some experts deemed as authentic and others classified as a fake upon sight. In another anecdote, he scrutinizes a ""couples lab"" where psychologist John Gottman determines if a matched pair will last the test of time by studying their conversation for 15 minutes - -he accurately predicts their fate about 90% of the time.Gladwell coins the term ""thin-slicing"" to capture these small snippets in time when a human judges a situation in an instant like a first date, hiring an employee, or meeting a new colleague. Human beings tend to take a first glance and ""thin-slice"" what they perceive through sight or interactions with the situation or individual. Rapid fire cognition is scary to many individuals and Gladwell believes that if ""we paid more attention to those fleeting moments...it would change the way wars are fought, the kinds of products we see on the shelves, the kinds of movies that get made, the way police officers are trained, the way couples are counseled...If you combine all those little changes together, you end up with a different and happier world."" How profound! He is attempting to bring psychology to the masses and does so artfully, choosing his words and sharping his ideas with high-interest examples to engage the reader. Gladwell further discusses ""priming,"" a term used to refer to subtle triggers that influence human behavior without any awareness of such changes (ex. Spain played classical music on subways and littering and vandalism decreased).The book incited much discussion with my book club membership- - thought provoking questions and topics selected from the Blink Reading Group Guide, but membership barely scratched the surface in their debate. This book caused the group to make many connections to their own lives and world. Conversation often digressed into self-reflective wondering or observations.Gladwell wants all readers to believe that intuition is often more reliable that reasoning and a series of data. But is that really the case? One criticism - he never addresses the brain in a scientific manner. In my own experience, I have learned (and am still learning) that I need to pay more attention to my intuition, my first gut instinct. I do not always think that ""thin-slicing"" is as reliable as collecting data and observations in many instances, but there is something to say about my first impressions of situations or people. I need to have more confidence about my ""gut impressions"" and have more faith in ME. Gladwell's book Blink substantiated that there is a certain degree of accuracy in my intuition. "
289,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5564285-sara-j-kefuwa,5,"This was the first Gladwell book I read. I read and finished it during my backpacking trip across Cambodia. I read it amongst the ruins of ancient temples, on bumpy dusty tuk-tuk rides, I held on to it while on the boat waiting for the freshwater dolphins to crest the surface of the mighty Mekong, I read it while sitting cross legged on the floor of the aisle of a public bus on the 2-hour ride back to Siem Reap.But even without all that hazy semi-sense-of-adventure-backpacking state of mind... I would still recommend this book to anyone. Or any of Mssr Gladwell's books honestly speaking (up to the date of this review I have read them all except for 'Tipping Point' and 'David & Goliath', ironically -or maybe rather quite properly Gladwellian- the first & latest of his books). In a nutshell, this book is about how intrinsically we know things. But how all that is usually drowned out or pushed to the corner of ones mind by a lot of good old crusty 'preconception', 'social upbringing' and 'societal brainwashing'. But maybe it's not something that comes when we think about it. Anyhow the main concept/theory in this book is not bedrock to be sure, but somewhat elastic. Something to be taken with a grain of salt. Just as relying too much on facts and proof takes the fun out of life, not caring at all about facts and proof takes out the foundations of sound character. Trust your gut, people. Trust your gut. But don't try too hard."
290,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38240230-dawn,4,"Audiobook read by the author. I'm going to keep this review short but I'm going to say it is an easy read and definitely worth reading. Basically, it is about the information our brains and subconscious process in the 'blink' of an eye. It's surprising how our subconscious knows what is happening in a scenario before we do. Gladwell provided many different scenarios and anecdotal stories throughout the book that were fascinating and eye-opening. It's sad to learn that we all are quick to judge and have many different stereotypes imbedded in our subconscious and conscious. The author's own anecdotal story of when he grew his hair out and the things that happened to him as a result is crazy. And he just had longer hair. So imagine all the other factors that play into someone's appearance and the quick judgements our subconscious starts to make. But this book isn't just about stereotypes. I also found the section on analyzing married couples fascinating. An expert (I forget his name) is able to 'thin slice' a couple's interaction with each other and can tell with 90% accuracy if they will stay married or not. Maybe this would be a good tool for counselors and therapists to learn before couples get married? Definitely recommend. 4 stars."
291,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,3,"I seem to be destined to be disappointed by every book that I pick up these days. Perhaps I am just in a reading funk, but this book, too, left me a bit unsatisfied. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but the book was essentially a series of anecdotes about instinct. Gladwell may call it ""thin-slicing"" but the book is really about making snap judgments, stereotyping, if you will. It's the judgment that we make in the first few seconds of an interaction, a judgment made in the ""blink"" of an eye. Often, if not always, these judgments are more true than the ones made with greater reflection and we ignore these ""thin-slices"" at our peril. That, in a nutshell (or a thin-slice), is the thesis of this book. It is an interesting theory and one that I find amicable. My personal experience seems to confirm it. Still, I would have liked to see the whole thing fleshed out just a bit more. It just seemed a bit lightweight overall, but interesting as pop science. "

I have to admit, in the first chapter I had a little knee-jerk reaction when I thought he was saying that our intuitive reactions are invariably correct. As I continued to read I appreciated his skill in outlining the complexity of his theory, and the fact that only one who is trained in a particular field can really articulate what is happening in his or her unconscious decision-making process. He also explained how that unconscious reaction can be skewed by unrelated factors, thus completely disproving my knee-jerk disagreement."

296,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178887-max-stone,3,"The general topic was how powerful our initial impressions are because we can process stuff really quick at a subconscious level in some cases. Blink was well written and pretty entertaining. I thought the author did a good job of coming up with interesting examples of good or bad information processing and I enjoyed reading those. However, aside from writing style and some fun examples, I thought the content was quite neatly separable into two parts:  (a) stuff that was interesting and seemed true and which I knew already, and  (b) stuff that seemed untrue or at least incoherant and that I hadn't previously heard before. but maybe that was just my closed mind at work. Examples of (a) were how you one's initial impression (lke in the first 5 seconds) of a teacher or an interviewee are pretty highly correlated with your opinion after an hour.There were lots of examples of (b). Like it was weird that one of his first and favorite examples was this guy who had studied videos of couples interacting in intense detail for decades, and had created a list for how someone could score such videos to predict odds that the marriage would last. It was supposed to be an example of ""blink"" processing because the expert could recognize it quickly, but to me it seemed more like the opposite since (1) non-experts (including the author) all had inaccurate instinctive reactions to watching the videos, and (2) the best way to get the right answer was a mechanical scorecard -- kind of the opposite of blink.And in general, there were examples of when you should trust your blink instinct and when that was wrong, but all the examples of when it was right or wrong seemed very post hoc (e.g. if your heart rate is over some threshold you shouldn't, but I don't think that would have come up unless he needed some explanation for why accidental police shootings occured), and he didn't really have a consistent framework for when it would be right or wrong, which made it kinda useless. and some seemed random, like the part about some musicians that musical experts liked but that did poorly in the musical equivalent of blind taste tests -- seemed likely that it was a friend of the author or some musician he liked (it was clear in the book that we should take as a given that it was a good musician and that the taste tests were wrong -- I was never quite clear why) and he was just trying to think of some way that might connect to his thesis.I liked the description of how orchestras started doing blind auditions to avoid discrimination against women. wasn't sure that it supported his thesis, but it was interesting. that was more or less my reaction to the whole book."
297,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/997376-soma,5,"Both ""Blink"" and ""The Tipping Point"" are nonfiction writings that deal with social structures and human tendancies and the unassuming look at these.""Tipping"" is more a look at society on a large scale. It has to do with trends: what makes something popular and who is involved in that process and why it works. This isn't a look at advertising or corporate businesses (although the does look at those, too) but rather a journey into the dynamics and parts of these trends. It's an intriguing and well written book, ideal for anyone who wants to know how social trends work. It has pracitcal applications as well, if you have any desire to make social changes yourself.""Blink"" is more on a personal level, and looks at how our subconcious works and how important it is in our daily life and daily choices. This book is amazing, and I highly recommend it for everyone. ""Tipping"" is really interesting and carries some amazing social insights, but only applies directly to those who wish to institute change, ""Blink"" on the other hand is a must-read for anyone who has ever wondered why they make the split-second decisions they make and whether they're good or bad. Which I hope is everyone. Malcolm Gladwell has an amazing way of writing as though he was chatting over a cup of coffee. His books are full of amazing insight, research, and profound ideas that revolutionize the world we live it, but there is never a point that you feel lost, like these ideas are only something the smart kids can truly understand. Another thing I truly enjoy is his absolute lack of preachieness. His opinions are strongly stated, but never forced on you."

But be careful, though, because: When we make a second split decision, we are also very vulnerable to being guided by our stereotypes and prejudices, even ones we may not necessarily endorse or believe.So what is the practical solution to make a split second decision? This ability improves with practice. Apparently, our unconscious thinking is no different from our conscious thinking: in both, we are able to develop our rapid decision making with training and experience.Probably one of the best psychology books that I’ve read.

300,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545336-mike,5,"Blink is an elegant 5 Star piece of science writing, dealing with how we think and chose in an instant. We make snap decisions based on experience or some other basis. Sometimes that is good and sometimes not. There are many good reviews so I am not going to spend more time on a review. What I will point out are two examples of how this book remains relevant today.First example is the recent campaign by Coca-Cola to sell specially colored white/silver cans of Coke over the 2011-2012 winter season to support “the plight of the polar bears.” Now, regardless of what you think about the motivation, the Cokeheads didn’t do their homework very well. In the book, Gladwell gives an example of a time 7-UP changed the shade of their green can and people complained that they had changed the taste. The 7-UP folks had simply changed the outside of the can, not the inside. Well, the very same thing happened to Coke. People started complaining the taste of regular Coke was different and sales started to go down. Well, astute businessmen that they are, the Cokies changed back to the normal red can ahead of schedule and sales went right back up, complaints went away. A simple reading of this book could have avoided this little mixup. (Coke continued the campaign to support the polar bears, or rather, the enviro’s who claim special concern over the bears plight).Another example is when I saw this principle in action. I was in the hospital recovery room after my son had an operation. A older couple was at another station as the wife was also recovering. One of the nurses offered her a soda and she asked for a Diet Coke. Well, the nurse reached into the small refrig and pulled out what looked like a Diet Coke but was really one of the special white/silver regular Coke cans. Only at the very last moment did the wife notice it wasn’t a diet drink. The thing is she is a diabetic and the sugary regular Coke would not have been good for her. Again, a brief glance resulted in a snap decision that could have been a real problem. Had the human factors folks at Coke read this book, maybe they would have noted this.I like Gladwell. He explains science simply and makes me feel smarter than I really am. Thanks dude."
301,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,4,"I've been listening to Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman while reading this book and the two are very closely related. I liked Blink more, so far. (Haven't completely finished the Kahneman one yet.) Gladwell is an excellent storyteller and, though he includes many scientific studies, Blink feels more approachable than Thinking Fast and Slow.The end result of reading back-to-back books on psychology that deal with our decision making processes and the problems/biases that we may have with them is that it has me doubting everything I've thought about or had to make a decision about for the past couple of days. I guess that's the sign of good literature, it makes you think and changes your worldview. While being slightly disturbed by all of this new input, I've also been wondering about how I can apply this new knowledge to its up-most potential.For example, I know within milliseconds of someone coming up to the reference desk, if the interaction I'm about to have with them is going to proceed smoothly or not. It's in their face, their pacing, if they're carrying something in their hands or not- I don't know how I know, I just know. From reading Gladwell's book, I think I do a combination of body language reading and then prime myself for whatever I think I've read in that glance about the person I'm about to deal with. Maybe I could prime myself to expect the best interaction for every experience? Maybe I could slow down the process of the gut check reaction? Anyway, this book taught me that I can do better and that perhaps I shouldn't rely on that immediate first impression to drive the rest of the action. Maybe I could set up a screen in front of my desk and then respond only to people's questions instead of how they're approaching me like how the interviewers removed the initial bias in the blind orchestral auditions... now there's an idea.If you enjoyed Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking then you may like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (more of a scientific approach to the same topic) or The Truth About Trust: How It Determines Success in Life, Love, Learning, and More by David DeSteno (mind blowing book, at least it was for me, on trust, and how we make our decisions to trust or not)."

303,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65250-sheila,4,"This book was really interesting. It discusses the way in which people can ""thin-slice"" a situation in a matter of seconds and make a judgement. This is where pre-conceived notions such as stereotypes can affect the way we react to something under a time constraint. It's about how our unconscious mind figures things out and affects how we feel or affects our actions before we even realize what is happening. Even if you aren't a racist, you can be programmed to act as a racist by the things you are exposed to in society. Even if you don't think you are sexist, you are more sexist than you think, due to programming. We associate things like home with mother and work with father. Examined in the book are police brutality, predictions of whether a couple will stay together (just by examining 15 min. of conversation), reading facial expressions, how one firefighter was able to thin slice a situation so quickly that he was able to save his men.The study I found most interesting was the analysis of an autistic man. We have a part of our brain we use for facial recognition and another part we use for object recognition. The autistic man used the object part of his brain for both facial recognition and for things like recognizing that an object was a chair. The autistic man would watch a movie and not ""get"" the emotional things happening because he barely paid attention to faces and didn't distinguish meaning from them. A new police officer, for example, in a time of distress where his heart is racing, he just finished chasing a man in his car for an hour, will become ""autistic"" so to speak because he ignores all cues and shoots a man to death. All he perceives is a threat and he forgets the person. A police officer with more experience will be able to ""thin slice"" the situation better in a matter of seconds and avoid an unecessary shooting.In order to be a good ""thin-slicer"", you probably have a lot of experience with what you are examining and it just becomes second nature. Some people are just naturally good at reading faces, predicting outcomes, and making those snap decisions that happen in the blink of an eye. Others, well, not as good! I feel that the book could use more focus, but overall, a good read.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the mysterious ways our minds work. "
304,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,3,"Won't do my typical long review for this book. I'm actually writing something more substantial that deals with these issues, so I'll save some of my energy for that. (And there is quite a bit more that needs reading). The short-short version of my usual long review is that Gladwell has some very good exploratory writing that he has written through anecdotes. This shouldn't surprise Gladwell fans. The problem with this book is that we never know whether he is intervening in the art vs. science debate, the intuitive vs. structured methods debate, or the rationalist vs. heuristic learning debate. If we were to read the book through any of these perspectives, unsurprisingly, the answer would be -- it all depends. Intuition can be the answer -- unless it's the problem. Intuition can be made better, through science. Unless our science is actually the problem, in that case, trust expert judgement (not necessarily the same thing as intuition, right?). The concepts get fuzzy. And actually, it seems like Gladwell is taking liberties with his subject matter to explore a range of things that might only be slightly related. One might take away from this book that we need to be aware of our own cognition, or that we need something called an epistemological frame. How do we know what we know? When is information too much information? When do we need rigor? When do we need to make a decision quickly? In any case, we're not sure what we're supposed to take away because the book hasn't quite settled into a fuller version of itself. That is my intuition as a writer. Gladwell has a second or third draft, but not quite a final draft. And that final draft might be a little beyond his capabilities. He might need a co-author, more time, or expertise to help his cause. There is a deep literature that deals with all of these subjects of epistemology, analytical failure, art vs. science (and so on). But since the book scrapes the surface of applied psychology, we're left with a few good stories and some things to think about. One has to remember that the author is a journalist and kind of intellectual voyeur -- thin-slicing is not only one of the topics of his book, it is also his profession. Not bad for a book written for a popular audience, but not great. "
305,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43449419-rawa-a,3,"This is going to be a very interesting review ..I was introduced to this book through Thinking, Fast And Slow and was very excited to read it; the idea is brilliant, it dwells on one of my favorite topics in psychology, and who doesn't want to have a deeper understanding of their own thought processes?It started with the Kouros story which was a great choice in my opinion to start the book with. In retrospect, it kind of summarized the whole book in a story format. One of my fav. I also really liked the idea of temporary autism and it's safe to say that it got me interested to the extent of wanting to know more about it and I honestly won't mind a book dedicated to it. The book also touched upon Priming in good details compared to other similar books. A huge chunk of the book, and by that I mean >70% of it, were examples to the ""Fast Thinking"" process, or the Blink in this book's terms, and if you've been reading my reviews you should realize by this point that I really love stories as examples as long as I get my share (I go with big portions here) of facts, science, and evidence based info. I was forced to compare the ""Blink"" to ""Fast Thinking"" introduced in Thinking, Fast And Slow, where the author in the later provided a huge deal of facts along with the multiple examples. I didn't find this in blink, in fact, I felt it's a good support for ""System 1"" (a synonym for fast thinking in the book's terms) , read before or after it to provide deeper understanding of it, it that is wanted. It won't have satisfied me at all as a standalone (maybe cuz I read the other book before it?)Another thing, the writer seemed a bit unsure, although he did lean more towards one of the opinions. Apart from repeating himself (and the incidents) a couple of times, he fluctuated between trusting our blink or going with deliberate thinking. Overall, this was a good read and I'll recommend it to others ✨."
306,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1698621-amy,4,"Fascinating book! I would describe Blink as promoting self-awareness more than self-help. It's a captivating exploration of the ability of our unconscious minds to accurately(much of the time)read the world around us. The psychological studies featured offered refreshing evidence that it isn't always in our best interest to slow down and think rationally. I wouldn't base an investment strategy on Gladwell's ""thin-slicing"" methods, but when it comes to matters of life and death, love, trust and marriage, oh, and battle tactics, Blink makes a convincing argument to ""go with our gut.""

307,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49049055-parth-agrawal,4,"An awesome choice of title first of all as it aptly highlights the direction in which the present day decision making process is going towards. With increasing complexity and requirement of multi tasking, decision making is that one quality that every one yearns for. But the travesty of the truth is that very few are there amongst us who really know the process of decision making. Well I used to think that you sit, process and decide. That's one method ofcourse. The other one that comes to my mind is you run, slip, dash and just pick one from the options available to you with just hope, and logic being the last thing, on your side. ;pAdding to the joy, various experimental findings have been highlighted in the book forming the crux of the fun which I won't disclose here as it'll rob you off the fun in it. IN the book, author explicitly says that decision making process actually has two approaches. The first one that i mentioned above involves comprehension, cognition and lot of data crunching leading to the conclusion. But the underlying assumption in this process is that you have an unlimited supply of time (which is hardly ever the case). The second one that i mentioned above is called rapid cognition and in a cursory glance it would seem to you as a random act. We pick an option under such circumstance only when we know that picking is compulsory and we would be better off with a wrong choice rather than with no choice at all. If someone picks the right one, losers instantaneously brand it as luck by chance. What if i told you that even behind your rapid cognition, there is a basis. There's reason that you chose a particular option and only that option amongst all the options. It has a direct relation with the memories and experiences that have created your subconscious since you have stepped foot on this planet.The best example of this can be seen in our own society. If some guy is seen with a tattoo, long hair, ostentatious clothes, our mind immediately forms an image of him as someone who's born with a silverspoon or has no regards for the life he is living, he must be arrogant, impertinent etc etc. Where do all these ideas come from? They are nothing more than what we have been fed into our minds repeatedly and on a daily basis. In India, the organisational hierarchy of the family leaves little room for individual thought process and as an aftermath, the habit of questioning and curiosity goes down the drain. Cultural practices as such, leads to the creation of these kind of biases and prejudices which in turn has brewed a great deal of hypocrisy in our generation as the same characteristics that I mentioned above becomes desirable to an individual and even after he/she attains it, he/she remains contemptuous of the practice as a whole because that's what he/she has been fed with. How often have we seen that a guy in public transport even if mistakenly outrages the modesty of a female passenger, the crowd goes berserk and thrash the guy presuming that he must have had bad intentions. His pleas and requests fall upon deaf ears as people have already taken a snap judgement and no amount of explanation can convince them otherwise. Talking about all this brings us to a very important question. Are we slaves to our snap judgments? Can't we break free the shackles of biases and prejudices? To answer this, it is important to know that there is one big similarity between our conscious and subconscious thinking process. Both of them can be trained and taught through repetitive exercises only. It might be possible for some of you to think that since subconscious decision making is a quick process, training it will also be likewise but it isn't. Author substantiates this claim by quoting instances in the book in which body guards, police officers are provided training of this sort in which they control their adrenaline rush by repeatedly practicing in high-stress situations in which they learn to control their heart-rates, resisting their brains to keep the amount of input from dropping which ultimately helps them to take judicious action in such situations. Thomas Hoving, a curator, says that:"" I try my best to create best first impressions of the people, activity or an object during my first interaction as I believe that our subconscious is an untapped source of abilities and possibilities and it can be educated and trained in a manner such that we harness it for the greater good and for all this to happen, I need to have a positive frame of mind for every new experience of life."" Do you agree? I most certainly do;);).   "

In Blink he postulates that often our first impressions or gut instincts are more likely to lead us to the the correct decision than if we spent a long time gathering information and weighing out the pros and cons of the particular situation. In other words, you should ""trust your gut"" In trademark Gladwell fashion he uses many entertaining stories and case studies to illustrate his points, while at the same time cautioning against trusting your first impressions too much. I don't think his arguments are as well articulated as those in The Tipping Point, but I'll leave that up to the individual reader to decide for themselves.My previous complaints about Gladwell's organization, and the repetition of his writing are still valid. I find reading the beginning of one of his chapters to be a very enjoyable experience, but by mid-chapter I usually find the going excruciatingly slow, and by the end I feel as if I've been wandering around the desert for days, and have finally found my way back to civilization. Despite these minor flaws, at the end of his books I always find myself excited as to what his next project might be, and eager to share his insights with others. "

The short subject studies that the author uses are interesting, easy to follow, and compelling evidence of his ""theory"" or study in first impressions. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sociology, psychology, or who spends a lot of time interacting with people. You will learn how and when to trust your ""gut feeling"" or first impressions of people, situations, and products. A great read!"

I love his writing and they way he can relate two things (or more) in such an intimate manner when at first they appear as just random events. That is a gift. This book is the 6th one that I've read by this author. I didn't like it as much as some of his other books. It didn't have the same edge as the others. It did however have some of the same entertainment appeal, so 3 stars."

316,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explores the phenomenon he calls 'thin slicing'; the human ability to winnow out, in fractions of a second, salient facts from a mass of information and make a decision based on them. Something most of us do all the time without giving it much conscious thought – reading the facial expressions and body language of the people with whom we interact, walking down a busy street (or a quiet street late at night), our subconscious minds processing hundreds or even thousands of bits of information, deciding which few are important and making a judgement based on them.Gladwell illustrates his thesis using several extended examples. The first is relatively straight forward. In 1983 California's Getty museum was offered a 2500 year old Greek statue, a kouros, for $10 million. All the tests said it was genuine but several art experts, at first glance and without being able to say precisely why, knew it was a fake. He also tells the stories of how an ugly chair conquered the offices of the world, how we are all effected by racial conditioning, how Chicago's Cook County hospital improved diagnosis of heart attacks by removing a physician's knowledge from the process, how a commander using WWII technology defeated the combined might of the the US armed forces in the largest ever war game, and more.The author uses two main studies to demonstrate how this process of instant assessment works. John Gottman's 'love lab', where he gets couples to talk about a subject tangentially connected with their relationship and videos the exchange to bring out the non-verbal cues, and Paul Ekman, who is an expert of facial micro-expressions that last microseconds and over which we have no control (this latter also being the model for the excellent TV show Lie To Me with Tim Roth). Gladwell builds his argument convincingly and refers back to his examples frequently for both illustration and dramatic effect. Each example he uses shows a different facet of the Blink effect but also, and this is vital, how it can go wrong in certain circumstances.While it is quick, this subconscious ability does require a moment to work, and can be short circuited by rushing or by an overload of adrenaline. Another case study chillingly shows what can happen when our subconscious is not given the opportunity to work properly. In 1999 an unarmed, innocent man, Amadou Diallo, was shot 41 times in the entryway of his own New York apartment building, by four policemen. He shows how a lack of experience, over-hasty action and perhaps even the over-confidence of numbers allowed these policemen to fall back on crude stereotypes and allow an initial poor assessment to lead them down a tragic course of events.While Gladwell lauds the benefits of both listening to this subconscious supercomputer and developing the skills, in backing up the studies he constantly refers to the fact that this understanding has often been achieved by the exact opposite type of mentation – deliberate, analytical evaluation of evidence. This, along with the examples given, should show the reader that there are appropriate and inappropriate areas for this sort of thinking, although I can imagine some of the readership taking away only the face-value lesson of relying on first instincts and gut feelings. I would have liked to see a chapter on the abuse of these impressions, which is after all how con artists and frauds such as psychics operate. This could have been perhaps added into the chapter on Warren G. Harding, who was elected as US president because he was tall, handsome, masculine, dignified – and is considered by historians to be one of the worst presidents in US history. I want to take nothing away from this excellent book, however. It is superbly written, making excellent use of pacing and the storylines of the examples he uses to give the book structure. Malcolm Gladwell has a great style, authoritative and engaging, and he packs a great deal of both information and analysis into what is a quick, easy and enjoyable read."
317,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6738834-fay-al,4,"Most of us don't know how our decision making / thinking process works. Turns out we're on auto pilot more often than not. Imagine if you had to think routine tasks everyday: walking, manipulating basic objects, recognizing faces, language...etc that would be exhausting and would consume much needed energy.“The mind operates most efficiently by relegating a good deal of high-level, sophisticated thinking to the unconscious, just as a modern jetliner is able to fly on automatic pilot with little or no input from the human, ‘conscious’ pilot. The adaptive unconscious does an excellent job of sizing up the world, warning people of danger, setting goals, and initiating action in a sophisticated and efficient manner.”We think we fully control every decision, but that's only what your mind is leading you to believe..... what we think of as free will is largely an illusion: much of the time, we are simply operating on automatic pilot, and the way we think and act — and how well we think and act on the spur of the moment — are a lot more susceptible to outside influences than we realize.Well it turns out, it's not that straightforward or under our conscious control as much as we'd like it to be:Reading Blink enables one to have a better idea of how it all works and become aware of the biases/influences that cloud our judgment. And there's plenty of examples & experiments in the book that highlights our ""flawed judgment"". And I think what all of this also means is that we're vulnerable to anyone wishing to manipulate us given that they know how our minds work better than we do.One experiment mentioned in the book about facial expressions struck me as very interesting. The face is not just a projection of what we think and feel, it also works the other way around.They gathered a group of volunteers and hooked them up to monitors measuring their heart rate and body temperature — the physiological signals of such emotions as anger, sadness, and fear. Half of the volunteers were told to try to remember and relive a particularly stressful experience. The other half were simply shown how to create, on their faces, the expressions that corresponded to stressful emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear. The second group, the people who were acting, showed the same physiological responses, the same heightened heart rate and body temperature, as the first group.A few years later, a German team of psychologists conducted a similar study. They had a group of subjects look at cartoons, either while holding a pen between their lips — an action that made it impossible to contract either of the two major smiling muscles, the risorius and the zygomatic major — or while holding a pen clenched between their teeth, which had the opposite effect and forced them to smile. The people with the pen between their teeth found the cartoons much funnier. These findings may be hard to believe, because we take it as a given that first we experience an emotion, and then we may — or may not — express that emotion on our face. We think of the face as the residue of emotion. What this research showed, though, is that the process works in the opposite direction as well. Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process."
318,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028530-caron,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written a book about the power of first impressions (aka intuition/ your gut feeling). He provides a series of anecdotes about the process of first reactions including a tale about a forged ancient Greek statue at the Getty that some experts deemed as authentic and others classified as a fake upon sight. In another anecdote, he scrutinizes a ""couples lab"" where psychologist John Gottman determines if a matched pair will last the test of time by studying their conversation for 15 minutes - -he accurately predicts their fate about 90% of the time.Gladwell coins the term ""thin-slicing"" to capture these small snippets in time when a human judges a situation in an instant like a first date, hiring an employee, or meeting a new colleague. Human beings tend to take a first glance and ""thin-slice"" what they perceive through sight or interactions with the situation or individual. Rapid fire cognition is scary to many individuals and Gladwell believes that if ""we paid more attention to those fleeting moments...it would change the way wars are fought, the kinds of products we see on the shelves, the kinds of movies that get made, the way police officers are trained, the way couples are counseled...If you combine all those little changes together, you end up with a different and happier world."" How profound! He is attempting to bring psychology to the masses and does so artfully, choosing his words and sharping his ideas with high-interest examples to engage the reader. Gladwell further discusses ""priming,"" a term used to refer to subtle triggers that influence human behavior without any awareness of such changes (ex. Spain played classical music on subways and littering and vandalism decreased).The book incited much discussion with my book club membership- - thought provoking questions and topics selected from the Blink Reading Group Guide, but membership barely scratched the surface in their debate. This book caused the group to make many connections to their own lives and world. Conversation often digressed into self-reflective wondering or observations.Gladwell wants all readers to believe that intuition is often more reliable that reasoning and a series of data. But is that really the case? One criticism - he never addresses the brain in a scientific manner. In my own experience, I have learned (and am still learning) that I need to pay more attention to my intuition, my first gut instinct. I do not always think that ""thin-slicing"" is as reliable as collecting data and observations in many instances, but there is something to say about my first impressions of situations or people. I need to have more confidence about my ""gut impressions"" and have more faith in ME. Gladwell's book Blink substantiated that there is a certain degree of accuracy in my intuition. "
319,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5564285-sara-j-kefuwa,5,"This was the first Gladwell book I read. I read and finished it during my backpacking trip across Cambodia. I read it amongst the ruins of ancient temples, on bumpy dusty tuk-tuk rides, I held on to it while on the boat waiting for the freshwater dolphins to crest the surface of the mighty Mekong, I read it while sitting cross legged on the floor of the aisle of a public bus on the 2-hour ride back to Siem Reap.But even without all that hazy semi-sense-of-adventure-backpacking state of mind... I would still recommend this book to anyone. Or any of Mssr Gladwell's books honestly speaking (up to the date of this review I have read them all except for 'Tipping Point' and 'David & Goliath', ironically -or maybe rather quite properly Gladwellian- the first & latest of his books). In a nutshell, this book is about how intrinsically we know things. But how all that is usually drowned out or pushed to the corner of ones mind by a lot of good old crusty 'preconception', 'social upbringing' and 'societal brainwashing'. But maybe it's not something that comes when we think about it. Anyhow the main concept/theory in this book is not bedrock to be sure, but somewhat elastic. Something to be taken with a grain of salt. Just as relying too much on facts and proof takes the fun out of life, not caring at all about facts and proof takes out the foundations of sound character. Trust your gut, people. Trust your gut. But don't try too hard."
320,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38240230-dawn,4,"Audiobook read by the author. I'm going to keep this review short but I'm going to say it is an easy read and definitely worth reading. Basically, it is about the information our brains and subconscious process in the 'blink' of an eye. It's surprising how our subconscious knows what is happening in a scenario before we do. Gladwell provided many different scenarios and anecdotal stories throughout the book that were fascinating and eye-opening. It's sad to learn that we all are quick to judge and have many different stereotypes imbedded in our subconscious and conscious. The author's own anecdotal story of when he grew his hair out and the things that happened to him as a result is crazy. And he just had longer hair. So imagine all the other factors that play into someone's appearance and the quick judgements our subconscious starts to make. But this book isn't just about stereotypes. I also found the section on analyzing married couples fascinating. An expert (I forget his name) is able to 'thin slice' a couple's interaction with each other and can tell with 90% accuracy if they will stay married or not. Maybe this would be a good tool for counselors and therapists to learn before couples get married? Definitely recommend. 4 stars."
321,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,3,"I seem to be destined to be disappointed by every book that I pick up these days. Perhaps I am just in a reading funk, but this book, too, left me a bit unsatisfied. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but the book was essentially a series of anecdotes about instinct. Gladwell may call it ""thin-slicing"" but the book is really about making snap judgments, stereotyping, if you will. It's the judgment that we make in the first few seconds of an interaction, a judgment made in the ""blink"" of an eye. Often, if not always, these judgments are more true than the ones made with greater reflection and we ignore these ""thin-slices"" at our peril. That, in a nutshell (or a thin-slice), is the thesis of this book. It is an interesting theory and one that I find amicable. My personal experience seems to confirm it. Still, I would have liked to see the whole thing fleshed out just a bit more. It just seemed a bit lightweight overall, but interesting as pop science. "
322,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1595511-kiri,5,"Fascinating! I have to admit, in the first chapter I had a little knee-jerk reaction when I thought he was saying that our intuitive reactions are invariably correct. As I continued to read I appreciated his skill in outlining the complexity of his theory, and the fact that only one who is trained in a particular field can really articulate what is happening in his or her unconscious decision-making process. He also explained how that unconscious reaction can be skewed by unrelated factors, thus completely disproving my knee-jerk disagreement."

326,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178887-max-stone,3,"The general topic was how powerful our initial impressions are because we can process stuff really quick at a subconscious level in some cases. Blink was well written and pretty entertaining. I thought the author did a good job of coming up with interesting examples of good or bad information processing and I enjoyed reading those. However, aside from writing style and some fun examples, I thought the content was quite neatly separable into two parts:  (a) stuff that was interesting and seemed true and which I knew already, and  (b) stuff that seemed untrue or at least incoherant and that I hadn't previously heard before. but maybe that was just my closed mind at work. Examples of (a) were how you one's initial impression (lke in the first 5 seconds) of a teacher or an interviewee are pretty highly correlated with your opinion after an hour.There were lots of examples of (b). Like it was weird that one of his first and favorite examples was this guy who had studied videos of couples interacting in intense detail for decades, and had created a list for how someone could score such videos to predict odds that the marriage would last. It was supposed to be an example of ""blink"" processing because the expert could recognize it quickly, but to me it seemed more like the opposite since (1) non-experts (including the author) all had inaccurate instinctive reactions to watching the videos, and (2) the best way to get the right answer was a mechanical scorecard -- kind of the opposite of blink.And in general, there were examples of when you should trust your blink instinct and when that was wrong, but all the examples of when it was right or wrong seemed very post hoc (e.g. if your heart rate is over some threshold you shouldn't, but I don't think that would have come up unless he needed some explanation for why accidental police shootings occured), and he didn't really have a consistent framework for when it would be right or wrong, which made it kinda useless. and some seemed random, like the part about some musicians that musical experts liked but that did poorly in the musical equivalent of blind taste tests -- seemed likely that it was a friend of the author or some musician he liked (it was clear in the book that we should take as a given that it was a good musician and that the taste tests were wrong -- I was never quite clear why) and he was just trying to think of some way that might connect to his thesis.I liked the description of how orchestras started doing blind auditions to avoid discrimination against women. wasn't sure that it supported his thesis, but it was interesting. that was more or less my reaction to the whole book."

It has to do with trends: what makes something popular and who is involved in that process and why it works. This isn't a look at advertising or corporate businesses (although the does look at those, too) but rather a journey into the dynamics and parts of these trends. It's an intriguing and well written book, ideal for anyone who wants to know how social trends work. It has pracitcal applications as well, if you have any desire to make social changes yourself.""Blink"" is more on a personal level, and looks at how our subconcious works and how important it is in our daily life and daily choices. This book is amazing, and I highly recommend it for everyone. ""Tipping"" is really interesting and carries some amazing social insights, but only applies directly to those who wish to institute change, ""Blink"" on the other hand is a must-read for anyone who has ever wondered why they make the split-second decisions they make and whether they're good or bad. Which I hope is everyone. Malcolm Gladwell has an amazing way of writing as though he was chatting over a cup of coffee. His books are full of amazing insight, research, and profound ideas that revolutionize the world we live it, but there is never a point that you feel lost, like these ideas are only something the smart kids can truly understand. Another thing I truly enjoy is his absolute lack of preachieness. His opinions are strongly stated, but never forced on you."

But be careful, though, because: When we make a second split decision, we are also very vulnerable to being guided by our stereotypes and prejudices, even ones we may not necessarily endorse or believe.So what is the practical solution to make a split second decision? This ability improves with practice. Apparently, our unconscious thinking is no different from our conscious thinking: in both, we are able to develop our rapid decision making with training and experience.Probably one of the best psychology books that I’ve read.

330,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545336-mike,5,"Blink is an elegant 5 Star piece of science writing, dealing with how we think and chose in an instant. We make snap decisions based on experience or some other basis. Sometimes that is good and sometimes not. There are many good reviews so I am not going to spend more time on a review. What I will point out are two examples of how this book remains relevant today.First example is the recent campaign by Coca-Cola to sell specially colored white/silver cans of Coke over the 2011-2012 winter season to support “the plight of the polar bears.” Now, regardless of what you think about the motivation, the Cokeheads didn’t do their homework very well. In the book, Gladwell gives an example of a time 7-UP changed the shade of their green can and people complained that they had changed the taste. The 7-UP folks had simply changed the outside of the can, not the inside. Well, the very same thing happened to Coke. People started complaining the taste of regular Coke was different and sales started to go down. Well, astute businessmen that they are, the Cokies changed back to the normal red can ahead of schedule and sales went right back up, complaints went away. A simple reading of this book could have avoided this little mixup. (Coke continued the campaign to support the polar bears, or rather, the enviro’s who claim special concern over the bears plight).Another example is when I saw this principle in action. I was in the hospital recovery room after my son had an operation. A older couple was at another station as the wife was also recovering. One of the nurses offered her a soda and she asked for a Diet Coke. Well, the nurse reached into the small refrig and pulled out what looked like a Diet Coke but was really one of the special white/silver regular Coke cans. Only at the very last moment did the wife notice it wasn’t a diet drink. The thing is she is a diabetic and the sugary regular Coke would not have been good for her. Again, a brief glance resulted in a snap decision that could have been a real problem. Had the human factors folks at Coke read this book, maybe they would have noted this.I like Gladwell. He explains science simply and makes me feel smarter than I really am. Thanks dude."
331,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,4,"I've been listening to Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman while reading this book and the two are very closely related. I liked Blink more, so far. (Haven't completely finished the Kahneman one yet.) Gladwell is an excellent storyteller and, though he includes many scientific studies, Blink feels more approachable than Thinking Fast and Slow.The end result of reading back-to-back books on psychology that deal with our decision making processes and the problems/biases that we may have with them is that it has me doubting everything I've thought about or had to make a decision about for the past couple of days. I guess that's the sign of good literature, it makes you think and changes your worldview. While being slightly disturbed by all of this new input, I've also been wondering about how I can apply this new knowledge to its up-most potential.For example, I know within milliseconds of someone coming up to the reference desk, if the interaction I'm about to have with them is going to proceed smoothly or not. It's in their face, their pacing, if they're carrying something in their hands or not- I don't know how I know, I just know. From reading Gladwell's book, I think I do a combination of body language reading and then prime myself for whatever I think I've read in that glance about the person I'm about to deal with. Maybe I could prime myself to expect the best interaction for every experience? Maybe I could slow down the process of the gut check reaction? Anyway, this book taught me that I can do better and that perhaps I shouldn't rely on that immediate first impression to drive the rest of the action. Maybe I could set up a screen in front of my desk and then respond only to people's questions instead of how they're approaching me like how the interviewers removed the initial bias in the blind orchestral auditions... now there's an idea.If you enjoyed Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking then you may like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (more of a scientific approach to the same topic) or The Truth About Trust: How It Determines Success in Life, Love, Learning, and More by David DeSteno (mind blowing book, at least it was for me, on trust, and how we make our decisions to trust or not)."

333,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65250-sheila,4,"This book was really interesting. It discusses the way in which people can ""thin-slice"" a situation in a matter of seconds and make a judgement. This is where pre-conceived notions such as stereotypes can affect the way we react to something under a time constraint. It's about how our unconscious mind figures things out and affects how we feel or affects our actions before we even realize what is happening. Even if you aren't a racist, you can be programmed to act as a racist by the things you are exposed to in society. Even if you don't think you are sexist, you are more sexist than you think, due to programming. We associate things like home with mother and work with father. Examined in the book are police brutality, predictions of whether a couple will stay together (just by examining 15 min. of conversation), reading facial expressions, how one firefighter was able to thin slice a situation so quickly that he was able to save his men.The study I found most interesting was the analysis of an autistic man. We have a part of our brain we use for facial recognition and another part we use for object recognition. The autistic man used the object part of his brain for both facial recognition and for things like recognizing that an object was a chair. The autistic man would watch a movie and not ""get"" the emotional things happening because he barely paid attention to faces and didn't distinguish meaning from them. A new police officer, for example, in a time of distress where his heart is racing, he just finished chasing a man in his car for an hour, will become ""autistic"" so to speak because he ignores all cues and shoots a man to death. All he perceives is a threat and he forgets the person. A police officer with more experience will be able to ""thin slice"" the situation better in a matter of seconds and avoid an unecessary shooting.In order to be a good ""thin-slicer"", you probably have a lot of experience with what you are examining and it just becomes second nature. Some people are just naturally good at reading faces, predicting outcomes, and making those snap decisions that happen in the blink of an eye. Others, well, not as good! I feel that the book could use more focus, but overall, a good read.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the mysterious ways our minds work. "
334,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,3,"Won't do my typical long review for this book. I'm actually writing something more substantial that deals with these issues, so I'll save some of my energy for that. (And there is quite a bit more that needs reading). The short-short version of my usual long review is that Gladwell has some very good exploratory writing that he has written through anecdotes. This shouldn't surprise Gladwell fans. The problem with this book is that we never know whether he is intervening in the art vs. science debate, the intuitive vs. structured methods debate, or the rationalist vs. heuristic learning debate. If we were to read the book through any of these perspectives, unsurprisingly, the answer would be -- it all depends. Intuition can be the answer -- unless it's the problem. Intuition can be made better, through science. Unless our science is actually the problem, in that case, trust expert judgement (not necessarily the same thing as intuition, right?). The concepts get fuzzy. And actually, it seems like Gladwell is taking liberties with his subject matter to explore a range of things that might only be slightly related. One might take away from this book that we need to be aware of our own cognition, or that we need something called an epistemological frame. How do we know what we know? When is information too much information? When do we need rigor? When do we need to make a decision quickly? In any case, we're not sure what we're supposed to take away because the book hasn't quite settled into a fuller version of itself. That is my intuition as a writer. Gladwell has a second or third draft, but not quite a final draft. And that final draft might be a little beyond his capabilities. He might need a co-author, more time, or expertise to help his cause. There is a deep literature that deals with all of these subjects of epistemology, analytical failure, art vs. science (and so on). But since the book scrapes the surface of applied psychology, we're left with a few good stories and some things to think about. One has to remember that the author is a journalist and kind of intellectual voyeur -- thin-slicing is not only one of the topics of his book, it is also his profession. Not bad for a book written for a popular audience, but not great. "

In retrospect, it kind of summarized the whole book in a story format. One of my fav. I also really liked the idea of temporary autism and it's safe to say that it got me interested to the extent of wanting to know more about it and I honestly won't mind a book dedicated to it. The book also touched upon Priming in good details compared to other similar books. A huge chunk of the book, and by that I mean >70% of it, were examples to the ""Fast Thinking"" process, or the Blink in this book's terms, and if you've been reading my reviews you should realize by this point that I really love stories as examples as long as I get my share (I go with big portions here) of facts, science, and evidence based info. I was forced to compare the ""Blink"" to ""Fast Thinking"" introduced in Thinking, Fast And Slow, where the author in the later provided a huge deal of facts along with the multiple examples. I didn't find this in blink, in fact, I felt it's a good support for ""System 1"" (a synonym for fast thinking in the book's terms) , read before or after it to provide deeper understanding of it, it that is wanted. It won't have satisfied me at all as a standalone (maybe cuz I read the other book before it?)Another thing, the writer seemed a bit unsure, although he did lean more towards one of the opinions. Apart from repeating himself (and the incidents) a couple of times, he fluctuated between trusting our blink or going with deliberate thinking. Overall, this was a good read and I'll recommend it to others ✨."
336,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1698621-amy,4,"Fascinating book! I would describe Blink as promoting self-awareness more than self-help. It's a captivating exploration of the ability of our unconscious minds to accurately(much of the time)read the world around us. The psychological studies featured offered refreshing evidence that it isn't always in our best interest to slow down and think rationally. I wouldn't base an investment strategy on Gladwell's ""thin-slicing"" methods, but when it comes to matters of life and death, love, trust and marriage, oh, and battle tactics, Blink makes a convincing argument to ""go with our gut."" "
337,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49049055-parth-agrawal,4,"An awesome choice of title first of all as it aptly highlights the direction in which the present day decision making process is going towards. With increasing complexity and requirement of multi tasking, decision making is that one quality that every one yearns for. But the travesty of the truth is that very few are there amongst us who really know the process of decision making. Well I used to think that you sit, process and decide. That's one method ofcourse. The other one that comes to my mind is you run, slip, dash and just pick one from the options available to you with just hope, and logic being the last thing, on your side. ;pAdding to the joy, various experimental findings have been highlighted in the book forming the crux of the fun which I won't disclose here as it'll rob you off the fun in it. IN the book, author explicitly says that decision making process actually has two approaches. The first one that i mentioned above involves comprehension, cognition and lot of data crunching leading to the conclusion. But the underlying assumption in this process is that you have an unlimited supply of time (which is hardly ever the case). The second one that i mentioned above is called rapid cognition and in a cursory glance it would seem to you as a random act. We pick an option under such circumstance only when we know that picking is compulsory and we would be better off with a wrong choice rather than with no choice at all. If someone picks the right one, losers instantaneously brand it as luck by chance. What if i told you that even behind your rapid cognition, there is a basis. There's reason that you chose a particular option and only that option amongst all the options. It has a direct relation with the memories and experiences that have created your subconscious since you have stepped foot on this planet.The best example of this can be seen in our own society. If some guy is seen with a tattoo, long hair, ostentatious clothes, our mind immediately forms an image of him as someone who's born with a silverspoon or has no regards for the life he is living, he must be arrogant, impertinent etc etc. Where do all these ideas come from? They are nothing more than what we have been fed into our minds repeatedly and on a daily basis. In India, the organisational hierarchy of the family leaves little room for individual thought process and as an aftermath, the habit of questioning and curiosity goes down the drain. Cultural practices as such, leads to the creation of these kind of biases and prejudices which in turn has brewed a great deal of hypocrisy in our generation as the same characteristics that I mentioned above becomes desirable to an individual and even after he/she attains it, he/she remains contemptuous of the practice as a whole because that's what he/she has been fed with. How often have we seen that a guy in public transport even if mistakenly outrages the modesty of a female passenger, the crowd goes berserk and thrash the guy presuming that he must have had bad intentions. His pleas and requests fall upon deaf ears as people have already taken a snap judgement and no amount of explanation can convince them otherwise. Talking about all this brings us to a very important question. Are we slaves to our snap judgments? Can't we break free the shackles of biases and prejudices? To answer this, it is important to know that there is one big similarity between our conscious and subconscious thinking process. Both of them can be trained and taught through repetitive exercises only. It might be possible for some of you to think that since subconscious decision making is a quick process, training it will also be likewise but it isn't. Author substantiates this claim by quoting instances in the book in which body guards, police officers are provided training of this sort in which they control their adrenaline rush by repeatedly practicing in high-stress situations in which they learn to control their heart-rates, resisting their brains to keep the amount of input from dropping which ultimately helps them to take judicious action in such situations. Thomas Hoving, a curator, says that:"" I try my best to create best first impressions of the people, activity or an object during my first interaction as I believe that our subconscious is an untapped source of abilities and possibilities and it can be educated and trained in a manner such that we harness it for the greater good and for all this to happen, I need to have a positive frame of mind for every new experience of life."" Do you agree? I most certainly do;);).   "

339,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627983-mahlon,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written yet another thought-provoking book. In Blink he postulates that often our first impressions or gut instincts are more likely to lead us to the the correct decision than if we spent a long time gathering information and weighing out the pros and cons of the particular situation. In other words, you should ""trust your gut"" In trademark Gladwell fashion he uses many entertaining stories and case studies to illustrate his points, while at the same time cautioning against trusting your first impressions too much. I don't think his arguments are as well articulated as those in The Tipping Point, but I'll leave that up to the individual reader to decide for themselves.My previous complaints about Gladwell's organization, and the repetition of his writing are still valid. I find reading the beginning of one of his chapters to be a very enjoyable experience, but by mid-chapter I usually find the going excruciatingly slow, and by the end I feel as if I've been wandering around the desert for days, and have finally found my way back to civilization. Despite these minor flaws, at the end of his books I always find myself excited as to what his next project might be, and eager to share his insights with others. "

You will learn how and when to trust your ""gut feeling"" or first impressions of people, situations, and products. A great read!"

346,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explores the phenomenon he calls 'thin slicing'; the human ability to winnow out, in fractions of a second, salient facts from a mass of information and make a decision based on them. Something most of us do all the time without giving it much conscious thought – reading the facial expressions and body language of the people with whom we interact, walking down a busy street (or a quiet street late at night), our subconscious minds processing hundreds or even thousands of bits of information, deciding which few are important and making a judgement based on them.Gladwell illustrates his thesis using several extended examples. The first is relatively straight forward. In 1983 California's Getty museum was offered a 2500 year old Greek statue, a kouros, for $10 million. All the tests said it was genuine but several art experts, at first glance and without being able to say precisely why, knew it was a fake. He also tells the stories of how an ugly chair conquered the offices of the world, how we are all effected by racial conditioning, how Chicago's Cook County hospital improved diagnosis of heart attacks by removing a physician's knowledge from the process, how a commander using WWII technology defeated the combined might of the the US armed forces in the largest ever war game, and more.The author uses two main studies to demonstrate how this process of instant assessment works. John Gottman's 'love lab', where he gets couples to talk about a subject tangentially connected with their relationship and videos the exchange to bring out the non-verbal cues, and Paul Ekman, who is an expert of facial micro-expressions that last microseconds and over which we have no control (this latter also being the model for the excellent TV show Lie To Me with Tim Roth). Gladwell builds his argument convincingly and refers back to his examples frequently for both illustration and dramatic effect. Each example he uses shows a different facet of the Blink effect but also, and this is vital, how it can go wrong in certain circumstances.While it is quick, this subconscious ability does require a moment to work, and can be short circuited by rushing or by an overload of adrenaline. Another case study chillingly shows what can happen when our subconscious is not given the opportunity to work properly. In 1999 an unarmed, innocent man, Amadou Diallo, was shot 41 times in the entryway of his own New York apartment building, by four policemen. He shows how a lack of experience, over-hasty action and perhaps even the over-confidence of numbers allowed these policemen to fall back on crude stereotypes and allow an initial poor assessment to lead them down a tragic course of events.While Gladwell lauds the benefits of both listening to this subconscious supercomputer and developing the skills, in backing up the studies he constantly refers to the fact that this understanding has often been achieved by the exact opposite type of mentation – deliberate, analytical evaluation of evidence. This, along with the examples given, should show the reader that there are appropriate and inappropriate areas for this sort of thinking, although I can imagine some of the readership taking away only the face-value lesson of relying on first instincts and gut feelings. I would have liked to see a chapter on the abuse of these impressions, which is after all how con artists and frauds such as psychics operate. This could have been perhaps added into the chapter on Warren G. Harding, who was elected as US president because he was tall, handsome, masculine, dignified – and is considered by historians to be one of the worst presidents in US history. I want to take nothing away from this excellent book, however. It is superbly written, making excellent use of pacing and the storylines of the examples he uses to give the book structure. Malcolm Gladwell has a great style, authoritative and engaging, and he packs a great deal of both information and analysis into what is a quick, easy and enjoyable read."
347,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6738834-fay-al,4,"Most of us don't know how our decision making / thinking process works. Turns out we're on auto pilot more often than not. Imagine if you had to think routine tasks everyday: walking, manipulating basic objects, recognizing faces, language...etc that would be exhausting and would consume much needed energy.“The mind operates most efficiently by relegating a good deal of high-level, sophisticated thinking to the unconscious, just as a modern jetliner is able to fly on automatic pilot with little or no input from the human, ‘conscious’ pilot. The adaptive unconscious does an excellent job of sizing up the world, warning people of danger, setting goals, and initiating action in a sophisticated and efficient manner.”We think we fully control every decision, but that's only what your mind is leading you to believe..... what we think of as free will is largely an illusion: much of the time, we are simply operating on automatic pilot, and the way we think and act — and how well we think and act on the spur of the moment — are a lot more susceptible to outside influences than we realize.Well it turns out, it's not that straightforward or under our conscious control as much as we'd like it to be:Reading Blink enables one to have a better idea of how it all works and become aware of the biases/influences that cloud our judgment. And there's plenty of examples & experiments in the book that highlights our ""flawed judgment"". And I think what all of this also means is that we're vulnerable to anyone wishing to manipulate us given that they know how our minds work better than we do.One experiment mentioned in the book about facial expressions struck me as very interesting. The face is not just a projection of what we think and feel, it also works the other way around.They gathered a group of volunteers and hooked them up to monitors measuring their heart rate and body temperature — the physiological signals of such emotions as anger, sadness, and fear. Half of the volunteers were told to try to remember and relive a particularly stressful experience. The other half were simply shown how to create, on their faces, the expressions that corresponded to stressful emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear. The second group, the people who were acting, showed the same physiological responses, the same heightened heart rate and body temperature, as the first group.A few years later, a German team of psychologists conducted a similar study. They had a group of subjects look at cartoons, either while holding a pen between their lips — an action that made it impossible to contract either of the two major smiling muscles, the risorius and the zygomatic major — or while holding a pen clenched between their teeth, which had the opposite effect and forced them to smile. The people with the pen between their teeth found the cartoons much funnier. These findings may be hard to believe, because we take it as a given that first we experience an emotion, and then we may — or may not — express that emotion on our face. We think of the face as the residue of emotion. What this research showed, though, is that the process works in the opposite direction as well. Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process."
348,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028530-caron,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written a book about the power of first impressions (aka intuition/ your gut feeling). He provides a series of anecdotes about the process of first reactions including a tale about a forged ancient Greek statue at the Getty that some experts deemed as authentic and others classified as a fake upon sight. In another anecdote, he scrutinizes a ""couples lab"" where psychologist John Gottman determines if a matched pair will last the test of time by studying their conversation for 15 minutes - -he accurately predicts their fate about 90% of the time.Gladwell coins the term ""thin-slicing"" to capture these small snippets in time when a human judges a situation in an instant like a first date, hiring an employee, or meeting a new colleague. Human beings tend to take a first glance and ""thin-slice"" what they perceive through sight or interactions with the situation or individual. Rapid fire cognition is scary to many individuals and Gladwell believes that if ""we paid more attention to those fleeting moments...it would change the way wars are fought, the kinds of products we see on the shelves, the kinds of movies that get made, the way police officers are trained, the way couples are counseled...If you combine all those little changes together, you end up with a different and happier world."" How profound! He is attempting to bring psychology to the masses and does so artfully, choosing his words and sharping his ideas with high-interest examples to engage the reader. Gladwell further discusses ""priming,"" a term used to refer to subtle triggers that influence human behavior without any awareness of such changes (ex. Spain played classical music on subways and littering and vandalism decreased).The book incited much discussion with my book club membership- - thought provoking questions and topics selected from the Blink Reading Group Guide, but membership barely scratched the surface in their debate. This book caused the group to make many connections to their own lives and world. Conversation often digressed into self-reflective wondering or observations.Gladwell wants all readers to believe that intuition is often more reliable that reasoning and a series of data. But is that really the case? One criticism - he never addresses the brain in a scientific manner. In my own experience, I have learned (and am still learning) that I need to pay more attention to my intuition, my first gut instinct. I do not always think that ""thin-slicing"" is as reliable as collecting data and observations in many instances, but there is something to say about my first impressions of situations or people. I need to have more confidence about my ""gut impressions"" and have more faith in ME. Gladwell's book Blink substantiated that there is a certain degree of accuracy in my intuition. "
349,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5564285-sara-j-kefuwa,5,"This was the first Gladwell book I read. I read and finished it during my backpacking trip across Cambodia. I read it amongst the ruins of ancient temples, on bumpy dusty tuk-tuk rides, I held on to it while on the boat waiting for the freshwater dolphins to crest the surface of the mighty Mekong, I read it while sitting cross legged on the floor of the aisle of a public bus on the 2-hour ride back to Siem Reap.But even without all that hazy semi-sense-of-adventure-backpacking state of mind... I would still recommend this book to anyone. Or any of Mssr Gladwell's books honestly speaking (up to the date of this review I have read them all except for 'Tipping Point' and 'David & Goliath', ironically -or maybe rather quite properly Gladwellian- the first & latest of his books). In a nutshell, this book is about how intrinsically we know things. But how all that is usually drowned out or pushed to the corner of ones mind by a lot of good old crusty 'preconception', 'social upbringing' and 'societal brainwashing'. But maybe it's not something that comes when we think about it. Anyhow the main concept/theory in this book is not bedrock to be sure, but somewhat elastic. Something to be taken with a grain of salt. Just as relying too much on facts and proof takes the fun out of life, not caring at all about facts and proof takes out the foundations of sound character. Trust your gut, people. Trust your gut. But don't try too hard."

Basically, it is about the information our brains and subconscious process in the 'blink' of an eye. It's surprising how our subconscious knows what is happening in a scenario before we do. Gladwell provided many different scenarios and anecdotal stories throughout the book that were fascinating and eye-opening. It's sad to learn that we all are quick to judge and have many different stereotypes imbedded in our subconscious and conscious. The author's own anecdotal story of when he grew his hair out and the things that happened to him as a result is crazy. And he just had longer hair. So imagine all the other factors that play into someone's appearance and the quick judgements our subconscious starts to make. But this book isn't just about stereotypes. I also found the section on analyzing married couples fascinating. An expert (I forget his name) is able to 'thin slice' a couple's interaction with each other and can tell with 90% accuracy if they will stay married or not. Maybe this would be a good tool for counselors and therapists to learn before couples get married? Definitely recommend. 4 stars."

Perhaps I am just in a reading funk, but this book, too, left me a bit unsatisfied. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but the book was essentially a series of anecdotes about instinct. Gladwell may call it ""thin-slicing"" but the book is really about making snap judgments, stereotyping, if you will. It's the judgment that we make in the first few seconds of an interaction, a judgment made in the ""blink"" of an eye. Often, if not always, these judgments are more true than the ones made with greater reflection and we ignore these ""thin-slices"" at our peril. That, in a nutshell (or a thin-slice), is the thesis of this book. It is an interesting theory and one that I find amicable. My personal experience seems to confirm it. Still, I would have liked to see the whole thing fleshed out just a bit more. It just seemed a bit lightweight overall, but interesting as pop science. "

I have to admit, in the first chapter I had a little knee-jerk reaction when I thought he was saying that our intuitive reactions are invariably correct. As I continued to read I appreciated his skill in outlining the complexity of his theory, and the fact that only one who is trained in a particular field can really articulate what is happening in his or her unconscious decision-making process. He also explained how that unconscious reaction can be skewed by unrelated factors, thus completely disproving my knee-jerk disagreement."

Blink was well written and pretty entertaining. I thought the author did a good job of coming up with interesting examples of good or bad information processing and I enjoyed reading those. However, aside from writing style and some fun examples, I thought the content was quite neatly separable into two parts:  (a) stuff that was interesting and seemed true and which I knew already, and  (b) stuff that seemed untrue or at least incoherant and that I hadn't previously heard before. but maybe that was just my closed mind at work. Examples of (a) were how you one's initial impression (lke in the first 5 seconds) of a teacher or an interviewee are pretty highly correlated with your opinion after an hour.There were lots of examples of (b). Like it was weird that one of his first and favorite examples was this guy who had studied videos of couples interacting in intense detail for decades, and had created a list for how someone could score such videos to predict odds that the marriage would last. It was supposed to be an example of ""blink"" processing because the expert could recognize it quickly, but to me it seemed more like the opposite since (1) non-experts (including the author) all had inaccurate instinctive reactions to watching the videos, and (2) the best way to get the right answer was a mechanical scorecard -- kind of the opposite of blink.And in general, there were examples of when you should trust your blink instinct and when that was wrong, but all the examples of when it was right or wrong seemed very post hoc (e.g. if your heart rate is over some threshold you shouldn't, but I don't think that would have come up unless he needed some explanation for why accidental police shootings occured), and he didn't really have a consistent framework for when it would be right or wrong, which made it kinda useless. and some seemed random, like the part about some musicians that musical experts liked but that did poorly in the musical equivalent of blind taste tests -- seemed likely that it was a friend of the author or some musician he liked (it was clear in the book that we should take as a given that it was a good musician and that the taste tests were wrong -- I was never quite clear why) and he was just trying to think of some way that might connect to his thesis.I liked the description of how orchestras started doing blind auditions to avoid discrimination against women. wasn't sure that it supported his thesis, but it was interesting. that was more or less my reaction to the whole book."

It has to do with trends: what makes something popular and who is involved in that process and why it works. This isn't a look at advertising or corporate businesses (although the does look at those, too) but rather a journey into the dynamics and parts of these trends. It's an intriguing and well written book, ideal for anyone who wants to know how social trends work. It has pracitcal applications as well, if you have any desire to make social changes yourself.""Blink"" is more on a personal level, and looks at how our subconcious works and how important it is in our daily life and daily choices. This book is amazing, and I highly recommend it for everyone. ""Tipping"" is really interesting and carries some amazing social insights, but only applies directly to those who wish to institute change, ""Blink"" on the other hand is a must-read for anyone who has ever wondered why they make the split-second decisions they make and whether they're good or bad. Which I hope is everyone. Malcolm Gladwell has an amazing way of writing as though he was chatting over a cup of coffee. His books are full of amazing insight, research, and profound ideas that revolutionize the world we live it, but there is never a point that you feel lost, like these ideas are only something the smart kids can truly understand. Another thing I truly enjoy is his absolute lack of preachieness. His opinions are strongly stated, but never forced on you."

But be careful, though, because: When we make a second split decision, we are also very vulnerable to being guided by our stereotypes and prejudices, even ones we may not necessarily endorse or believe.So what is the practical solution to make a split second decision? This ability improves with practice.

This unconscious decision making that the author calls ‘thin slicing’ is something we all partake in day to day.These snap decisions, the author warns can be harmful because of the biases and prejudice we carry with us, citing the shooting of Amadou Diallo, the election of Warren Harding, the New Coke and research that I have come to associate with Gladwell. .Blink isn’t perfect, kinda difficult to review but I love how it made me see certain things differently, how we should trust our gut even though we cannot explain it but should use this power judiciously as there are a lot of factors to consider when to give that good old gut feeling a miss.Pick this book for something quintessentially Malcolm Gladwell and I loved every bit of it! I’d recommend it for anyone who loves interesting facts and thorough analysis as I do."
361,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1416084-marta,1,"This book is an awesome illustration of the fact that reading a book because it was displayed on an endcap is not always a good decision. If it is pretty obvious to you that sometimes snap decisions (e.g. reading blink) are bad, and sometimes snap decisions (e.g. waiting to get blink from library so that I didn't waste my money buying it) are good, then you shouldn't read this book unless you are pretty desperate for entertainment. On the other hand, you might enjoy the irony of reading a book about how 'you can trust your gut instinct' all the way to the end even though your gut kept shouting at you that it wasn't worth your time to read this book. Point being, if you would like malcom gladwell to punch you in your gut instinct, this book will do the trick. "

So he relates plenty of examples and counter-examples, but he is only reporting interesting (if somewhat obvious) results - many of them, like a magpie picking up glittery objects, and there isn't any conclusion - nothing to tie it all together. Well he's a reporter not a scientist, so maybe it's unreasonable to expect him to have one. But the jargon! He calls this ability (or inability) to size things up in a flash ""thin-slicing"" .... over and over again. But I guess I could go 2.5 stars "
363,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36071668-pradnya-k,4,"Liked the book. The plethora of examples from various sectors and the workout made me go on. Non fictions are not always fun to read but books like blink take the grasp on mind. The well researched incidents are quite interesting. No story of course however I did miss one. Loved the way psychology of American cops is explained. From a marriage counsellor to face reader, from cops to fire fighters, it touch bases different area, sliced and served. The writer hasn't taken sides. In fact he warns how a rushed decision or intuition can go wrong.Give your mind something to gorge upon, go for it."

366,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633211-vikas,4,"This turned out to be my very first read by Malcolm Gladwell and I remember that I wanted to read this and Outliers for the longest of the times. Well I finally could and wow Gladwell first introduces the concept of snap decisions then it's success stories then it's horror stories then the people who have mastered the art of snap decisions and then the science of Snap Decisions. It was a wonderful book I liked it immensely. I now tend to listen to ebooks via Text to speech than staring at my phone screen so I can get through even the boring parts in a go. But here those were few and far between and and I liked this one like I said earlier.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is of course Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore. I have bookcases filled with books which are waiting to be read so can't stay and spend more time in this review, so remember I loved reading this and love reading more, you should also read what you love and then just Keep on Reading."

It cuts through all the nonsense and unimportant information that hinders conscious decision making/logic at times. While this is an important tool to use, it's important not to solely rely on instinct or else you will end up falling victim to your own prejudices and pre-conceived notions. There is a time and a place for both types of thought, trust them both, rely on both, and you will be more successful at making decisions. "
368,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70078-chloe,3,"With his study of how ideas spread in The Tipping Point and then with his explanation of how humans rely on intuition here in Blink, Malcolm Gladwell has carved a comfortable niche for himself among the pop-science authors of today. With his eye for patterns and a knack for putting into words many of the quirks of humankind that we take for granted, Gladwell has made a science out of common sense.In this, his second book, Gladwell looks at our ability to subconsciously process information in a far faster and more detailed way than our conscious minds are typically capable of. This is hardly new ground- the Beats intoned “First thought, best thought.” Obi-Wan Kenobi told Luke to “trust your instincts” and Luke managed to blow up the Death Star without aid from his targeting computer. Examples abound. Gladwell, as all social scientists must, puts his own stamp on it by renaming it ""thin slicing"" (the knack we have for deriving often correct solutions/ideas from a small sampling of information).There's not much that is new or ground-breaking within these pages. Gladwell builds his case for thin slicing with many vastly different examples, from studies performed to read the micro-expressions in people's faces which betray their mood and thoughts (I think someone at Fox must have read this book before developing ""Lie To Me"") to the way in which people may be ""primed"" to be more cooperative or smart simply by being exposed to a series of terms or thinking about the traits of a good professor (the most disturbing example of this is when Gladwell cites a study in which a group of African-American students attending an Ivy League school take a test in which they are asked their racial information at either the beginning of the test or at the end. Those who fill in the racial info before taking the test performed far worse due to being primed to think of all the stories about black students' inability to perform well on standardized testing.)The latter half of the book is spent analyzing those events in which our intuition leads us astray, the most glaring example of which is the 1999 shooting of the unarmed Amadou Diallo by a group of four police officers. While interesting and definitely a good check on those who read the first half of the book and want to go out and only trust their instincts, I felt that Gladwell never really made clear the instances in which we should rely on our gut or when we should proceed in a thorough and detailed manner. Still, this was an incredibly interesting read that provided much fodder for both thought and discussion around the supper table. I'd recommend it for those in search of a quick non-fiction read or who enjoy the slow accumulation of trivia."
369,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,3,"Gladwell shares intriguing examples of the role of the unconscious in making decisions. He tells of the surprising accuracy of snap judgments, and how people’s experiences greatly influence their decisions, despite their unawareness. Many of his stories are fascinating, but his slow, winding way of telling them is frustrating. I wanted to shout, “I get the point! Move on!” I didn’t like this book as much as Outliers (read my review), but I wasn’t as interested in this topic as the subject of Outliers (achieving success).I really liked the investigation into how ignorant people are of the factors that affect their decisions. One of my favorite sections was about how people perceive food to taste better or worse based on the food’s branding and packaging. Gladwell also shows that, counter-intuitively, too much information or too many choices inhibit judgements, because they become distracting. This idea is also explored in Nudge (read my review), which I highly recommend.I had heard of this book before, but finally decided to read it after Brendon Sinclair recommended it in the The Web Design Business Kit 2.0 from SitePoint. In the kit, Brendon explains that web designers need to design websites that make great first impressions and are simple enough to facilitate quick, unconscious decisions. I’ll try to keep these lessons in mind for my web design company, OptimWise.Gladwell shows that snap judgments can be quite accurate because of thin slicing; the brain is able to get a “read” on a person or object based on a very short exposure to them. Of first impressions, he says that “sometimes we can know more about someone or something in the blink of an eye than after months of study.”We make judgments based on our experiences and situations, so prejudice and stereotypes can lead us astray. To minimize their effects, Gladwell suggests that we change our experiences. For example, by spending more time with the people against whom we’re prejudiced, we can retrain our brains to overcome the prejudice."
370,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/252024-atul-sabnis,2,"It’s about six-forty in the morning and I just finished Blink, by Malcom Gladwell. I have yet to read The Tipping Point by the same author, but now, I am not sure that I will.The problem with any book is its reputation - especially if there is a lot of it. For some reason - it kept reminding me of Freakonomics - only this was esoteric on the dull side.There is a trend (I am not sure who started it) of looking at the world as if suddenly we are finding new things. These books go on with examples and experiences - and it just seems never ending. Some examples are interesting - but then it does get boring after a while. India Unbound, The World is Flat (left it halfway), and now Blink. I am given to believe that the Tipping Point is similar. I call these, the “books that tell us what we know”. And I may add, “that we choose not to know”. Possibly we are bang in between a revolution of how we see our world - and these are the small changes that we dont notice. Hmm. Need to read Tipping Point.Freakonomics stands out - because the relationships that it talks of - are curious, to say the least.Blink is a good book, mind you, nothing wrong with it - but it failed to impress. At least as much as the promise that people said it held. The theory that the book talks about is absolutely bang on! And I should have known. I don’t pick up books recommended by some people. Then many people talk about it - I know all the more I shouldn’t pick it up. But then you feel left out - because everyone is talking about it. That is not the Blink moment. The moment I choose not to pick it up is the Blink moment.Recommended only if you want to be told, with never ending examples of, what you possibly already know. Yawn, need to get forty blinks…er…winks, or more."
371,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269099-angela-blount,4,"A fascinating read. Just when I'd promised myself I'd stay out of the psych section for a while, Blink managed to lure me back. While the author spends the first half of the book nearly pounding you into the ground with story after story and account after account of the power of unconscious snap decisions, I could appreciate the number of studies cited in the research. (He had me convinced in half of the time he actually took to do so; that's all I'm saying.) Gladwell balances an admiration for people who've developed savant-like capacities in their fields of expertise, while pointing out instances where such experts can actually handicap themselves by becoming too bogged down in details.The second half of the book would appeal to anyone concerned with reading the complex and minute expressions in the human face. For those who may have enjoyed the television series ""Lie To Me,"" this reads as the real-life basis behind the art of micro-expressions and deception detection.I deeply appreciated the author's brief but penetrating look into the differing processes of a mind with Autism. He presents the concept that any overly-stimulated ""normal"" person can essentially exhibit autism-like perceptions, leading to a domino effect of misjudgements and faulty resulting actions. In that same vein, he also sheds light on an array of controversial topics--particularly related to human biases and police-chases. I found myself with a new way of looking at errors made by over-stressed police officers and, consequently, a new respect for them."
372,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153548-graham,2,"This is pop psychology, pages and pages of narrative prose describing civil war battles, musical careers, and police chases in support of the premise that we underestimate the part of our mind that makes snap judgments. Gladwell did some sort of research, but research in relation to psychology implies a thesis tested against authoritative sources. Assembling a series of cool stories and presenting them as case studies seems a little disingenuous. The conclusion I reach is that OK we might benefit from viewing social prejudice as a scientific fact. We might benefit by becoming aware of situations where ""rapid cognition"" can improve our on the job perfomance. However, I think the reason this book is a bestseller is that people (myself included) tend to wander around Borders bookstore looking for some sort of shortcut to social insight. I regret to say I had my thumb up my ass to the extent that I felt it was important to read Blink."
373,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125014-julie-davis,4,"I really liked this look at snap decisions, what they are (and why we often don't recognize them), when they work (and why), when they don't work (and why). The case studies are what lift the book and act as the glue holding together Gladwell's thoughts on the subject.I myself make a lot of snap decisions. In this I am aided by my husband. Together we decided on a car in two days. We knew the house we wanted the first time we saw it. These were classic snap decisions (without the benefit of anything but what felt right). I liked Gladwell's conclusion that context and prior expertise in a subject are what are really needed to be able to trust a lot of one's quick decisions. The car and house were truly snap. When someone brings up food oriented issues, my knee jerk reactions are more trustworthy because I have decades of experience in food reading and cooking.This was an enjoyable, enlightening look at something we all think we already understand."
374,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,3,"The first book by Gladwell that disappointed meTo be fair, this was the first book he wrote that was publicly recognized and he clearly evolved from here. „Talking to strangers“ and „Outliers“ are amazing books, but this one seems to be the first pancake. He already started his characteristic style of telling his thesis through case studies, but this time the selection isn‘t great and instead of making several points, this book only evolves around one thesis, which is also contradicted in ""Range"" by David Epstein, which is a book I can really recommend btw.This time his linear argumentation style also really started to bother me. In my opinion there were several ways to interpret the studies which he simply ignored...Writing takes practice and experience and it‘s nice to see how Gladwell developed, looking at previous work! This book isn‘t bad, but just not good either."

The Power of Thinking without Thinking actually taught me a lot, something that I can actually use in my day-to-day life which is very interesting.I liked Malcolm Gladwell (is this considered thin slicing?) as soon as I started to read thefirst chapter, he made this book interesting and simple without over complicating things, without using big, difficult words (although the facial movement chapter was using loads of science names for each muscle which lost me).The only thing is sometimes the book was like 'thin slicing is good' ... 'no it's bad, look see?' but I guess it's all about reading the situation first but then that's not thin slicing is it? Anyway, I liked this book, I do like psychology so I maybe a lil' bias there!x"

“understanding the true nature of instinctive decision making requires us to be forgiving of those people trapped in circumstances where good judgment is imperiled.”
Blink was somewhat interesting. I was hoping for more though. Facts noted in Blink are mostly intuitive, the main one being that we draw many conclusions from the first few seconds of our personal observations. I also thought the book played the race card a little heavy. How we are quick to judge African-Americans as ""dangerous"" or ""bad"". Not that I necessarily disagree, but it's a theme that's played and replayed throughout the book."
377,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47369055,4,"Another very fascinating book by Gladwell. the ideas that he brings and the way he discusses them with the studies and real events that prove those ideas were very well written.I have two main issues with the book first was the audio quality but that is a minor issue. The main issue is one that someone wrote about before and I could not help but notice it now. Gladwell is excellent in showing the reader studies and real events that only support his ideas or claims but does very little in discussing any studies or conflicting ideas with the ones he is writing about. however, I think it is more on the reader rather than the author to look for any ideas that may contradict those of the author."

Have a bit problem with understanding the logic of first example of the book: two decks of blue and red cards. The unconscious response of the players to red cards could cased because it's easy to understand the higher risk associated with each red card, but it could goes two way. It doesn't mean they understood blue cards win more, they simply reacted more to the red cards. They should repeat the test with a deck of red cards with a higher mathematical expectation than the blue cards and see if player's body send the similar signals. "

Of course, this doesn't happen by accident, but by practice .. This is the power of thinking wihtout thinking, which the author of this book calls ""blink"", and he took so long to deliver this simple fact. The book goes long and far from the main idea, and since it's not the author's field of expertise he use an odd and unrelated stories to complete the book as if he cuts some stories from a newspaper under his hand to make a book out of them .. This idea might seem reasonable when you know that he has a column in some newspaper and he actually used some of his articles to finish the book !!"

Quite frankly, I found the book to be based on research that is totally bunk - such as the Implicit Association Test which has been proven to be neither a reliable nor a valid test. The first chapter or two were somewhat interesting, but it quickly wore out its welcome when it started making huge claims that aren’t supported by broad and diverse case studies or comprehensive and reliable evidence."

Then I get sucked in by the anecdotes.As usual, Gladwell uses a series of stories to illustrate the quirks of human thinking. I'm sure it's been said many times that he is the poster boy for ""the plural of anecdote is not data"". Still, he's a lot of fun to read, and I keep doing it."

The characters of one story might show up in another and provide you a sense of familiarity, but they don't bring anything else from the earlier story with them. For all purposes you could start at the second story and nothing would change. This book is a collection of research and anecdotes (the stories) from the world of rapid cognition but it lacks a general structure to bring the whole thing together. Mind you the short stories in and of themselves are excellent. Malcolm Gladwell is an extraordinary storyteller. (Watch this In Conversation with Tyler Cowen to see for yourself)One really good thing about this book is that it does not pretend to ignore research/anecdotes going against the validity of decisions made in a blink. In fact a substantial portion of the book is dedicated to precisely how our snap (often unconscious) judgement affect our actions (yeah, it is a lot about racism and sexism). BTW, if you think you are not even unconsciously racist or sexist do read this book.Finally, I should point out that this book has the best discussion about police violence I have ever encountered. (Can you apply it to Kashmir? I think so.)"
386,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70642519-jacey-crayton,2,"""Blink"" is, overall, a very intriguing book about the mind. There were many points in the book that I thought were extremely fascinating. However, I would personally only give it about 2 stars. The book contains a lot of content that can only really be understood by someone that understands subjects like science and psychology really, really well. Although I get the basics, I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of the specifics just because there is so much terminology & abstract ideas that are hard for me to grasp. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a challenging, thought-provoking read, but it may not be enjoyable to people like me that struggle with more advanced texts. I also felt like the book itself didn't have a clear point. Gladwell began the book with a strong ""thesis"" so to speak. The point for a while was that not all decisions need to be made over long periods of time, & that sometimes decisions can be made within the blink of an eye and still be just as reliable & accurate. However, the book shifted tones several times as Gladwell started giving examples of the opposite. I felt like he would basically say ""snap judgments can be accurately made, except when they can't."" To me, the book felt relatively pointless at times because of the contradictions. However, I still believe that, as stated earlier, there are a few good qualities of this book. It's very thought-provoking & it draws attention to the different parts of the mind, why people do what they do, & how sometimes we know something without knowing that we know it. Gladwell is an outstanding author, but I think this specific novel doesn't quite show his full potential. I would highly recommend another one of his books, ""The Outliers"", which plays with the idea that success is determined by several unexpected factors. "
387,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85808493-ishi-time,4,"I had the opportunity to attend one of Malcolm Gladwell's talks when I was in high school, and the way he talked about things shifted the world into a new perspective for me. Ever since then, I've wanted to read more of his books so I'm very happy to have finally gotten around to this one. I listened to the audiobook (which he narrates himself) and I finished it in one go. I'm not exactly sure how to rate and review nonfiction yet, so here are some topics that I found fascinating:- an excess of information is more likely to be overwhelming rather than helpful - people were shown silent 2-5 second clips of a professor and asked whether they think that professor is good or not. Their conclusions based on the short clips were consistent with feedback from students who have taken classes with those professors. - a group of people (different genders and different races) were sent to a car dealership and asked to negotiate for a car. They were all given the same backstory. They all came across different results. - people can't actually control their expressions as well as they think they can. I loved listening to this book. It brought to my attention many things that I have never considered before, and I'm looking forward to reading Gladwell's other books as well. "
388,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16870554-janelle,5,"Malcolm Gladwell has a fascinating way of sorting out interesting phenomena in our world, and once again I feel I've learned a lot reading this over the last few weeks. I also enjoyed it because he writes like he talks, and I know that because I've enjoyed many of his podcasts (Revisionist History). This book was written in 2005, and since then many of the things he discusses are still relevant, in particular how we can influence our response to race by being exposed to the good in that race, e.g. pictures of Rev Martin Luther King (and how we can't otherwise easily change that snap /subconscious impression...even African Americans have negative responses to people in their race on certain tests...). And the most fascinating chapter to me, ""Seven Seconds in the Bronx""...wow, learning how to read faces, (we all do as we age with experience, but some people are masters of it...), and that we need TIME to read faces, so police officers should not have partners, as it makes them much quicker to respond without fully analyzing situations *and shooting or antagonizing innocent people! (I'm going to pay attention going forward how often innocent people are shot in these race-motivated shootings when there are 2 police officers...) . Fascinating book in other ways, too. "
389,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2764185-chris-shank,4,"First of all, the subtitle. “The power of thinking without thinking.” Not a very honest beginning. It felt very sophomoric, almost slimy, like a ‘get smart quick’ kind of sell. And that completely asinine phrase inside the front flap, “Don’t think—blink!” What do we have here? A ‘28th habit’ to seduce the bourgeois into thinking he can make his enterprise—be it a career, business, or relationship—soar beyond his philistine peers? In other words, yet another leadership book?Well, I was wrong…or the Little Brown marketing team is a bunch of leadership junkies. The basic principle of Blink is that ‘decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.’ If this sounds like a truism, that’s because it is; but in this our Age of Information, where developed intellectual prowess and academic pursuits are touted as the key to success, influence, and even happiness, the reminder and thorough illustration of the power of raw, instinctual ability that each individual is born with is much needed. Opportunity for cultured talent is available to anybody, in any situation, because each of us is born with a power of mind/body that in some unique way is unparalleled even by the most gifted minds. In the words of Carl Jung, (who used the terms ‘unconscious’ and ‘conscious’ in place of ‘instinct’ and ‘intellect’, respectively) we are each born with a field of unconscious experience and skill that is infinite and unfathomed in our singular and relatively short-lived lives. Gladwell, I think, is really pushing Blink as an egalitarian value and leveler across pedigrees and social privilege. “The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves…Thin-slicing is not an exotic gift. It is a central part of what it means to be human.”I learned so much from Gladwell’s breakdown of ‘thin-slicing’, the ability to take a small sample of experience and interpret accurately the meaning of a moment or future results in a few milliseconds of instinctual reflex. It’s actually a fun experiment to think of all the incredible thin-slicers we know that are experts in one form or another—be it the social, mechanical, philosophical, athletic, scientific or artistic realms. Snap-judgment had a bad connotation in my mind before reading this, but now I can dub this reflex ‘thin-slicing’ and embrace the sheer genius of it all. That’s how I roll.The idea of psychological priming was also so intriguing to me. To think that a mere image or suggestive thought can do so much to determine our reflexive, unconscious responses! This can work in our favor, or against us. Gladwell cites several studies in which the unconscious attitudes of the subjects were incompatible with their stated conscious values. An opportunity to take a quick test in the book confirmed the fear that we are all operating on some measure of sickeningly deficient stereotypes that we fall back on in alarm or haste. However, there is hope. We can’t help it in the moment, but we can help it before the moment by preparation and intentional priming. A simple primed image or word may be enough to condition the brain to be better managed in unplanned moments. “Our first impressions are generated by our experiences and our environment, which means that we can change our first impressions—we can alter the way we thin-slice—by changing the experiences that comprise those impressions.” Even something as seemingly insignificant as voluntary facial expressions can prime our thoughts to become more positive.This leads to Gladwell’s assertion that spontaneity isn’t random. There are truly times in our lives and endeavors when time is severely limited, and the best decision has to be a quick decision, or opportunities go up in flame. The best choices can be instantaneous, but the difference between a good blink and a bad blink is literally in the past. The present ‘you’ is almost literally the autopilot of the past ‘you’. Don’t over-think that. If the heart rate is over 145 beats per minute, motor skills begin to lock up; and after 175 there is absolute breakdown of mental functioning. What keeps the heart rate down in moments of crisis? Familiarity, vitality, and structure; and all these are fostered before moments of crisis.The author made a good case against over-verbalizing our thoughts, presuming to be able to explain all of our motives or foreign situations we find ourselves in. Doing so can badly misconstrue what has happened in moments that are incomprehensible to the conscious mind. It is called “verbal overshadowing”, and the only people who are able to successfully describe their motives or ‘blinks’ are the experts that have thoroughly familiarized themselves with a pscho-somatic activity or an experience. Even then the caution stands.The last half of the book felt repetitive, maybe because I was ‘blinking’ to conclusions, or maybe because it really was repetitive. After all that talk about priming and avoiding creating premature interpretations, surely we wouldn’t expect Gladwell to miss an opportunity to prime us with as many illustrations—‘pictures’—and expert interpretation as he could with the remaining pages! I was a little disappointed that he didn’t lean away from illustration to more strategic instruction in the last half, but I suppose I can personalize it for myself. Overall a really neat book, and inspiring to focus on ways that I can prime and support better reflexive decisions—blinks—in the future."
390,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66630540-mansi-mudgal,4,"Blink by Malcolm Gladwell is a book about snap judgements, split second decisions and what we call the gut feeling and how sometimes we must listen to thoughts that come to us in a BLINK. This unconscious decision making that the author calls ‘thin slicing’ is something we all partake in day to day.These snap decisions, the author warns can be harmful because of the biases and prejudice we carry with us, citing the shooting of Amadou Diallo, the election of Warren Harding, the New Coke and research that I have come to associate with Gladwell. .Blink isn’t perfect, kinda difficult to review but I love how it made me see certain things differently, how we should trust our gut even though we cannot explain it but should use this power judiciously as there are a lot of factors to consider when to give that good old gut feeling a miss.Pick this book for something quintessentially Malcolm Gladwell and I loved every bit of it! I’d recommend it for anyone who loves interesting facts and thorough analysis as I do."
391,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1416084-marta,1,"This book is an awesome illustration of the fact that reading a book because it was displayed on an endcap is not always a good decision. If it is pretty obvious to you that sometimes snap decisions (e.g. reading blink) are bad, and sometimes snap decisions (e.g. waiting to get blink from library so that I didn't waste my money buying it) are good, then you shouldn't read this book unless you are pretty desperate for entertainment. On the other hand, you might enjoy the irony of reading a book about how 'you can trust your gut instinct' all the way to the end even though your gut kept shouting at you that it wasn't worth your time to read this book. Point being, if you would like malcom gladwell to punch you in your gut instinct, this book will do the trick. "

So he relates plenty of examples and counter-examples, but he is only reporting interesting (if somewhat obvious) results - many of them, like a magpie picking up glittery objects, and there isn't any conclusion - nothing to tie it all together. Well he's a reporter not a scientist, so maybe it's unreasonable to expect him to have one. But the jargon! He calls this ability (or inability) to size things up in a flash ""thin-slicing"" .... over and over again. But I guess I could go 2.5 stars "

Non fictions are not always fun to read but books like blink take the grasp on mind. The well researched incidents are quite interesting. No story of course however I did miss one. Loved the way psychology of American cops is explained. From a marriage counsellor to face reader, from cops to fire fighters, it touch bases different area, sliced and served. The writer hasn't taken sides. In fact he warns how a rushed decision or intuition can go wrong.Give your mind something to gorge upon, go for it."

Well I finally could and wow Gladwell first introduces the concept of snap decisions then it's success stories then it's horror stories then the people who have mastered the art of snap decisions and then the science of Snap Decisions. It was a wonderful book I liked it immensely. I now tend to listen to ebooks via Text to speech than staring at my phone screen so I can get through even the boring parts in a go. But here those were few and far between and and I liked this one like I said earlier.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is of course Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore. I have bookcases filled with books which are waiting to be read so can't stay and spend more time in this review, so remember I loved reading this and love reading more, you should also read what you love and then just Keep on Reading."

It cuts through all the nonsense and unimportant information that hinders conscious decision making/logic at times. While this is an important tool to use, it's important not to solely rely on instinct or else you will end up falling victim to your own prejudices and pre-conceived notions. There is a time and a place for both types of thought, trust them both, rely on both, and you will be more successful at making decisions. "
398,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70078-chloe,3,"With his study of how ideas spread in The Tipping Point and then with his explanation of how humans rely on intuition here in Blink, Malcolm Gladwell has carved a comfortable niche for himself among the pop-science authors of today. With his eye for patterns and a knack for putting into words many of the quirks of humankind that we take for granted, Gladwell has made a science out of common sense.In this, his second book, Gladwell looks at our ability to subconsciously process information in a far faster and more detailed way than our conscious minds are typically capable of. This is hardly new ground- the Beats intoned “First thought, best thought.” Obi-Wan Kenobi told Luke to “trust your instincts” and Luke managed to blow up the Death Star without aid from his targeting computer. Examples abound. Gladwell, as all social scientists must, puts his own stamp on it by renaming it ""thin slicing"" (the knack we have for deriving often correct solutions/ideas from a small sampling of information).There's not much that is new or ground-breaking within these pages. Gladwell builds his case for thin slicing with many vastly different examples, from studies performed to read the micro-expressions in people's faces which betray their mood and thoughts (I think someone at Fox must have read this book before developing ""Lie To Me"") to the way in which people may be ""primed"" to be more cooperative or smart simply by being exposed to a series of terms or thinking about the traits of a good professor (the most disturbing example of this is when Gladwell cites a study in which a group of African-American students attending an Ivy League school take a test in which they are asked their racial information at either the beginning of the test or at the end. Those who fill in the racial info before taking the test performed far worse due to being primed to think of all the stories about black students' inability to perform well on standardized testing.)The latter half of the book is spent analyzing those events in which our intuition leads us astray, the most glaring example of which is the 1999 shooting of the unarmed Amadou Diallo by a group of four police officers. While interesting and definitely a good check on those who read the first half of the book and want to go out and only trust their instincts, I felt that Gladwell never really made clear the instances in which we should rely on our gut or when we should proceed in a thorough and detailed manner. Still, this was an incredibly interesting read that provided much fodder for both thought and discussion around the supper table. I'd recommend it for those in search of a quick non-fiction read or who enjoy the slow accumulation of trivia."
399,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,3,"Gladwell shares intriguing examples of the role of the unconscious in making decisions. He tells of the surprising accuracy of snap judgments, and how people’s experiences greatly influence their decisions, despite their unawareness. Many of his stories are fascinating, but his slow, winding way of telling them is frustrating. I wanted to shout, “I get the point! Move on!” I didn’t like this book as much as Outliers (read my review), but I wasn’t as interested in this topic as the subject of Outliers (achieving success).I really liked the investigation into how ignorant people are of the factors that affect their decisions. One of my favorite sections was about how people perceive food to taste better or worse based on the food’s branding and packaging. Gladwell also shows that, counter-intuitively, too much information or too many choices inhibit judgements, because they become distracting. This idea is also explored in Nudge (read my review), which I highly recommend.I had heard of this book before, but finally decided to read it after Brendon Sinclair recommended it in the The Web Design Business Kit 2.0 from SitePoint. In the kit, Brendon explains that web designers need to design websites that make great first impressions and are simple enough to facilitate quick, unconscious decisions. I’ll try to keep these lessons in mind for my web design company, OptimWise.Gladwell shows that snap judgments can be quite accurate because of thin slicing; the brain is able to get a “read” on a person or object based on a very short exposure to them. Of first impressions, he says that “sometimes we can know more about someone or something in the blink of an eye than after months of study.”We make judgments based on our experiences and situations, so prejudice and stereotypes can lead us astray. To minimize their effects, Gladwell suggests that we change our experiences. For example, by spending more time with the people against whom we’re prejudiced, we can retrain our brains to overcome the prejudice."
400,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/252024-atul-sabnis,2,"It’s about six-forty in the morning and I just finished Blink, by Malcom Gladwell. I have yet to read The Tipping Point by the same author, but now, I am not sure that I will.The problem with any book is its reputation - especially if there is a lot of it. For some reason - it kept reminding me of Freakonomics - only this was esoteric on the dull side.There is a trend (I am not sure who started it) of looking at the world as if suddenly we are finding new things. These books go on with examples and experiences - and it just seems never ending. Some examples are interesting - but then it does get boring after a while. India Unbound, The World is Flat (left it halfway), and now Blink. I am given to believe that the Tipping Point is similar. I call these, the “books that tell us what we know”. And I may add, “that we choose not to know”. Possibly we are bang in between a revolution of how we see our world - and these are the small changes that we dont notice. Hmm. Need to read Tipping Point.Freakonomics stands out - because the relationships that it talks of - are curious, to say the least.Blink is a good book, mind you, nothing wrong with it - but it failed to impress. At least as much as the promise that people said it held. The theory that the book talks about is absolutely bang on! And I should have known. I don’t pick up books recommended by some people. Then many people talk about it - I know all the more I shouldn’t pick it up. But then you feel left out - because everyone is talking about it. That is not the Blink moment. The moment I choose not to pick it up is the Blink moment.Recommended only if you want to be told, with never ending examples of, what you possibly already know. Yawn, need to get forty blinks…er…winks, or more."
401,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269099-angela-blount,4,"A fascinating read. Just when I'd promised myself I'd stay out of the psych section for a while, Blink managed to lure me back. While the author spends the first half of the book nearly pounding you into the ground with story after story and account after account of the power of unconscious snap decisions, I could appreciate the number of studies cited in the research. (He had me convinced in half of the time he actually took to do so; that's all I'm saying.) Gladwell balances an admiration for people who've developed savant-like capacities in their fields of expertise, while pointing out instances where such experts can actually handicap themselves by becoming too bogged down in details.The second half of the book would appeal to anyone concerned with reading the complex and minute expressions in the human face. For those who may have enjoyed the television series ""Lie To Me,"" this reads as the real-life basis behind the art of micro-expressions and deception detection.I deeply appreciated the author's brief but penetrating look into the differing processes of a mind with Autism. He presents the concept that any overly-stimulated ""normal"" person can essentially exhibit autism-like perceptions, leading to a domino effect of misjudgements and faulty resulting actions. In that same vein, he also sheds light on an array of controversial topics--particularly related to human biases and police-chases. I found myself with a new way of looking at errors made by over-stressed police officers and, consequently, a new respect for them."
402,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153548-graham,2,"This is pop psychology, pages and pages of narrative prose describing civil war battles, musical careers, and police chases in support of the premise that we underestimate the part of our mind that makes snap judgments. Gladwell did some sort of research, but research in relation to psychology implies a thesis tested against authoritative sources. Assembling a series of cool stories and presenting them as case studies seems a little disingenuous. The conclusion I reach is that OK we might benefit from viewing social prejudice as a scientific fact. We might benefit by becoming aware of situations where ""rapid cognition"" can improve our on the job perfomance. However, I think the reason this book is a bestseller is that people (myself included) tend to wander around Borders bookstore looking for some sort of shortcut to social insight. I regret to say I had my thumb up my ass to the extent that I felt it was important to read Blink."
403,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125014-julie-davis,4,"I really liked this look at snap decisions, what they are (and why we often don't recognize them), when they work (and why), when they don't work (and why). The case studies are what lift the book and act as the glue holding together Gladwell's thoughts on the subject.I myself make a lot of snap decisions. In this I am aided by my husband. Together we decided on a car in two days. We knew the house we wanted the first time we saw it. These were classic snap decisions (without the benefit of anything but what felt right). I liked Gladwell's conclusion that context and prior expertise in a subject are what are really needed to be able to trust a lot of one's quick decisions. The car and house were truly snap. When someone brings up food oriented issues, my knee jerk reactions are more trustworthy because I have decades of experience in food reading and cooking.This was an enjoyable, enlightening look at something we all think we already understand."
404,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,3,"The first book by Gladwell that disappointed meTo be fair, this was the first book he wrote that was publicly recognized and he clearly evolved from here. „Talking to strangers“ and „Outliers“ are amazing books, but this one seems to be the first pancake. He already started his characteristic style of telling his thesis through case studies, but this time the selection isn‘t great and instead of making several points, this book only evolves around one thesis, which is also contradicted in ""Range"" by David Epstein, which is a book I can really recommend btw.This time his linear argumentation style also really started to bother me. In my opinion there were several ways to interpret the studies which he simply ignored...Writing takes practice and experience and it‘s nice to see how Gladwell developed, looking at previous work! This book isn‘t bad, but just not good either."

The Power of Thinking without Thinking actually taught me a lot, something that I can actually use in my day-to-day life which is very interesting.I liked Malcolm Gladwell (is this considered thin slicing?) as soon as I started to read thefirst chapter, he made this book interesting and simple without over complicating things, without using big, difficult words (although the facial movement chapter was using loads of science names for each muscle which lost me).The only thing is sometimes the book was like 'thin slicing is good' ... 'no it's bad, look see?' but I guess it's all about reading the situation first but then that's not thin slicing is it? Anyway, I liked this book, I do like psychology so I maybe a lil' bias there!x"

“understanding the true nature of instinctive decision making requires us to be forgiving of those people trapped in circumstances where good judgment is imperiled.”
Blink was somewhat interesting. I was hoping for more though. Facts noted in Blink are mostly intuitive, the main one being that we draw many conclusions from the first few seconds of our personal observations. I also thought the book played the race card a little heavy. How we are quick to judge African-Americans as ""dangerous"" or ""bad"". Not that I necessarily disagree, but it's a theme that's played and replayed throughout the book."

The main issue is one that someone wrote about before and I could not help but notice it now. Gladwell is excellent in showing the reader studies and real events that only support his ideas or claims but does very little in discussing any studies or conflicting ideas with the ones he is writing about. however, I think it is more on the reader rather than the author to look for any ideas that may contradict those of the author."

Have a bit problem with understanding the logic of first example of the book: two decks of blue and red cards. The unconscious response of the players to red cards could cased because it's easy to understand the higher risk associated with each red card, but it could goes two way. It doesn't mean they understood blue cards win more, they simply reacted more to the red cards. They should repeat the test with a deck of red cards with a higher mathematical expectation than the blue cards and see if player's body send the similar signals. "

The book goes long and far from the main idea, and since it's not the author's field of expertise he use an odd and unrelated stories to complete the book as if he cuts some stories from a newspaper under his hand to make a book out of them ..

The characters of one story might show up in another and provide you a sense of familiarity, but they don't bring anything else from the earlier story with them. For all purposes you could start at the second story and nothing would change. This book is a collection of research and anecdotes (the stories) from the world of rapid cognition but it lacks a general structure to bring the whole thing together. Mind you the short stories in and of themselves are excellent. Malcolm Gladwell is an extraordinary storyteller. (Watch this In Conversation with Tyler Cowen to see for yourself)One really good thing about this book is that it does not pretend to ignore research/anecdotes going against the validity of decisions made in a blink. In fact a substantial portion of the book is dedicated to precisely how our snap (often unconscious) judgement affect our actions (yeah, it is a lot about racism and sexism). BTW, if you think you are not even unconsciously racist or sexist do read this book.Finally, I should point out that this book has the best discussion about police violence I have ever encountered. (Can you apply it to Kashmir? I think so.)"
416,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70642519-jacey-crayton,2,"""Blink"" is, overall, a very intriguing book about the mind. There were many points in the book that I thought were extremely fascinating. However, I would personally only give it about 2 stars. The book contains a lot of content that can only really be understood by someone that understands subjects like science and psychology really, really well. Although I get the basics, I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of the specifics just because there is so much terminology & abstract ideas that are hard for me to grasp. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a challenging, thought-provoking read, but it may not be enjoyable to people like me that struggle with more advanced texts. I also felt like the book itself didn't have a clear point. Gladwell began the book with a strong ""thesis"" so to speak. The point for a while was that not all decisions need to be made over long periods of time, & that sometimes decisions can be made within the blink of an eye and still be just as reliable & accurate. However, the book shifted tones several times as Gladwell started giving examples of the opposite. I felt like he would basically say ""snap judgments can be accurately made, except when they can't."" To me, the book felt relatively pointless at times because of the contradictions. However, I still believe that, as stated earlier, there are a few good qualities of this book. It's very thought-provoking & it draws attention to the different parts of the mind, why people do what they do, & how sometimes we know something without knowing that we know it. Gladwell is an outstanding author, but I think this specific novel doesn't quite show his full potential. I would highly recommend another one of his books, ""The Outliers"", which plays with the idea that success is determined by several unexpected factors. "
417,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85808493-ishi-time,4,"I had the opportunity to attend one of Malcolm Gladwell's talks when I was in high school, and the way he talked about things shifted the world into a new perspective for me. Ever since then, I've wanted to read more of his books so I'm very happy to have finally gotten around to this one. I listened to the audiobook (which he narrates himself) and I finished it in one go. I'm not exactly sure how to rate and review nonfiction yet, so here are some topics that I found fascinating:- an excess of information is more likely to be overwhelming rather than helpful - people were shown silent 2-5 second clips of a professor and asked whether they think that professor is good or not. Their conclusions based on the short clips were consistent with feedback from students who have taken classes with those professors. - a group of people (different genders and different races) were sent to a car dealership and asked to negotiate for a car. They were all given the same backstory. They all came across different results. - people can't actually control their expressions as well as they think they can. I loved listening to this book. It brought to my attention many things that I have never considered before, and I'm looking forward to reading Gladwell's other books as well. "
418,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16870554-janelle,5,"Malcolm Gladwell has a fascinating way of sorting out interesting phenomena in our world, and once again I feel I've learned a lot reading this over the last few weeks. I also enjoyed it because he writes like he talks, and I know that because I've enjoyed many of his podcasts (Revisionist History). This book was written in 2005, and since then many of the things he discusses are still relevant, in particular how we can influence our response to race by being exposed to the good in that race, e.g. pictures of Rev Martin Luther King (and how we can't otherwise easily change that snap /subconscious impression...even African Americans have negative responses to people in their race on certain tests...). And the most fascinating chapter to me, ""Seven Seconds in the Bronx""...wow, learning how to read faces, (we all do as we age with experience, but some people are masters of it...), and that we need TIME to read faces, so police officers should not have partners, as it makes them much quicker to respond without fully analyzing situations *and shooting or antagonizing innocent people! (I'm going to pay attention going forward how often innocent people are shot in these race-motivated shootings when there are 2 police officers...) . Fascinating book in other ways, too. "
419,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2764185-chris-shank,4,"First of all, the subtitle. “The power of thinking without thinking.” Not a very honest beginning. It felt very sophomoric, almost slimy, like a ‘get smart quick’ kind of sell. And that completely asinine phrase inside the front flap, “Don’t think—blink!” What do we have here? A ‘28th habit’ to seduce the bourgeois into thinking he can make his enterprise—be it a career, business, or relationship—soar beyond his philistine peers? In other words, yet another leadership book?Well, I was wrong…or the Little Brown marketing team is a bunch of leadership junkies. The basic principle of Blink is that ‘decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.’ If this sounds like a truism, that’s because it is; but in this our Age of Information, where developed intellectual prowess and academic pursuits are touted as the key to success, influence, and even happiness, the reminder and thorough illustration of the power of raw, instinctual ability that each individual is born with is much needed. Opportunity for cultured talent is available to anybody, in any situation, because each of us is born with a power of mind/body that in some unique way is unparalleled even by the most gifted minds. In the words of Carl Jung, (who used the terms ‘unconscious’ and ‘conscious’ in place of ‘instinct’ and ‘intellect’, respectively) we are each born with a field of unconscious experience and skill that is infinite and unfathomed in our singular and relatively short-lived lives. Gladwell, I think, is really pushing Blink as an egalitarian value and leveler across pedigrees and social privilege. “The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves…Thin-slicing is not an exotic gift. It is a central part of what it means to be human.”I learned so much from Gladwell’s breakdown of ‘thin-slicing’, the ability to take a small sample of experience and interpret accurately the meaning of a moment or future results in a few milliseconds of instinctual reflex. It’s actually a fun experiment to think of all the incredible thin-slicers we know that are experts in one form or another—be it the social, mechanical, philosophical, athletic, scientific or artistic realms. Snap-judgment had a bad connotation in my mind before reading this, but now I can dub this reflex ‘thin-slicing’ and embrace the sheer genius of it all. That’s how I roll.The idea of psychological priming was also so intriguing to me. To think that a mere image or suggestive thought can do so much to determine our reflexive, unconscious responses! This can work in our favor, or against us. Gladwell cites several studies in which the unconscious attitudes of the subjects were incompatible with their stated conscious values. An opportunity to take a quick test in the book confirmed the fear that we are all operating on some measure of sickeningly deficient stereotypes that we fall back on in alarm or haste. However, there is hope. We can’t help it in the moment, but we can help it before the moment by preparation and intentional priming. A simple primed image or word may be enough to condition the brain to be better managed in unplanned moments. “Our first impressions are generated by our experiences and our environment, which means that we can change our first impressions—we can alter the way we thin-slice—by changing the experiences that comprise those impressions.” Even something as seemingly insignificant as voluntary facial expressions can prime our thoughts to become more positive.This leads to Gladwell’s assertion that spontaneity isn’t random. There are truly times in our lives and endeavors when time is severely limited, and the best decision has to be a quick decision, or opportunities go up in flame. The best choices can be instantaneous, but the difference between a good blink and a bad blink is literally in the past. The present ‘you’ is almost literally the autopilot of the past ‘you’. Don’t over-think that. If the heart rate is over 145 beats per minute, motor skills begin to lock up; and after 175 there is absolute breakdown of mental functioning. What keeps the heart rate down in moments of crisis? Familiarity, vitality, and structure; and all these are fostered before moments of crisis.The author made a good case against over-verbalizing our thoughts, presuming to be able to explain all of our motives or foreign situations we find ourselves in. Doing so can badly misconstrue what has happened in moments that are incomprehensible to the conscious mind. It is called “verbal overshadowing”, and the only people who are able to successfully describe their motives or ‘blinks’ are the experts that have thoroughly familiarized themselves with a pscho-somatic activity or an experience. Even then the caution stands.The last half of the book felt repetitive, maybe because I was ‘blinking’ to conclusions, or maybe because it really was repetitive. After all that talk about priming and avoiding creating premature interpretations, surely we wouldn’t expect Gladwell to miss an opportunity to prime us with as many illustrations—‘pictures’—and expert interpretation as he could with the remaining pages! I was a little disappointed that he didn’t lean away from illustration to more strategic instruction in the last half, but I suppose I can personalize it for myself. Overall a really neat book, and inspiring to focus on ways that I can prime and support better reflexive decisions—blinks—in the future."
420,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545336-mike,5,"Blink is an elegant 5 Star piece of science writing, dealing with how we think and chose in an instant. We make snap decisions based on experience or some other basis. Sometimes that is good and sometimes not. There are many good reviews so I am not going to spend more time on a review. What I will point out are two examples of how this book remains relevant today.First example is the recent campaign by Coca-Cola to sell specially colored white/silver cans of Coke over the 2011-2012 winter season to support “the plight of the polar bears.” Now, regardless of what you think about the motivation, the Cokeheads didn’t do their homework very well. In the book, Gladwell gives an example of a time 7-UP changed the shade of their green can and people complained that they had changed the taste. The 7-UP folks had simply changed the outside of the can, not the inside. Well, the very same thing happened to Coke. People started complaining the taste of regular Coke was different and sales started to go down. Well, astute businessmen that they are, the Cokies changed back to the normal red can ahead of schedule and sales went right back up, complaints went away. A simple reading of this book could have avoided this little mixup. (Coke continued the campaign to support the polar bears, or rather, the enviro’s who claim special concern over the bears plight).Another example is when I saw this principle in action. I was in the hospital recovery room after my son had an operation. A older couple was at another station as the wife was also recovering. One of the nurses offered her a soda and she asked for a Diet Coke. Well, the nurse reached into the small refrig and pulled out what looked like a Diet Coke but was really one of the special white/silver regular Coke cans. Only at the very last moment did the wife notice it wasn’t a diet drink. The thing is she is a diabetic and the sugary regular Coke would not have been good for her. Again, a brief glance resulted in a snap decision that could have been a real problem. Had the human factors folks at Coke read this book, maybe they would have noted this.I like Gladwell. He explains science simply and makes me feel smarter than I really am. Thanks dude."
421,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,4,"I've been listening to Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman while reading this book and the two are very closely related. I liked Blink more, so far. (Haven't completely finished the Kahneman one yet.) Gladwell is an excellent storyteller and, though he includes many scientific studies, Blink feels more approachable than Thinking Fast and Slow.The end result of reading back-to-back books on psychology that deal with our decision making processes and the problems/biases that we may have with them is that it has me doubting everything I've thought about or had to make a decision about for the past couple of days. I guess that's the sign of good literature, it makes you think and changes your worldview. While being slightly disturbed by all of this new input, I've also been wondering about how I can apply this new knowledge to its up-most potential.For example, I know within milliseconds of someone coming up to the reference desk, if the interaction I'm about to have with them is going to proceed smoothly or not. It's in their face, their pacing, if they're carrying something in their hands or not- I don't know how I know, I just know. From reading Gladwell's book, I think I do a combination of body language reading and then prime myself for whatever I think I've read in that glance about the person I'm about to deal with. Maybe I could prime myself to expect the best interaction for every experience? Maybe I could slow down the process of the gut check reaction? Anyway, this book taught me that I can do better and that perhaps I shouldn't rely on that immediate first impression to drive the rest of the action. Maybe I could set up a screen in front of my desk and then respond only to people's questions instead of how they're approaching me like how the interviewers removed the initial bias in the blind orchestral auditions... now there's an idea.If you enjoyed Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking then you may like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (more of a scientific approach to the same topic) or The Truth About Trust: How It Determines Success in Life, Love, Learning, and More by David DeSteno (mind blowing book, at least it was for me, on trust, and how we make our decisions to trust or not)."
422,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30261451-celia,4,"This is a book about intuition: when it is right and when it can be fatally WRONG. I was impressed with all that was said in this book and am still thinking about why!!In the meantime, my husband stole my copy, so before I really get into why, I will have to steal it back!!I did listen to this book as well. It is narrated by the author. Malcolm Gladwell is a great speaker with a properly modulated voice and sympathetic tone. "
423,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65250-sheila,4,"This book was really interesting. It discusses the way in which people can ""thin-slice"" a situation in a matter of seconds and make a judgement. This is where pre-conceived notions such as stereotypes can affect the way we react to something under a time constraint. It's about how our unconscious mind figures things out and affects how we feel or affects our actions before we even realize what is happening. Even if you aren't a racist, you can be programmed to act as a racist by the things you are exposed to in society. Even if you don't think you are sexist, you are more sexist than you think, due to programming. We associate things like home with mother and work with father. Examined in the book are police brutality, predictions of whether a couple will stay together (just by examining 15 min. of conversation), reading facial expressions, how one firefighter was able to thin slice a situation so quickly that he was able to save his men.The study I found most interesting was the analysis of an autistic man. We have a part of our brain we use for facial recognition and another part we use for object recognition. The autistic man used the object part of his brain for both facial recognition and for things like recognizing that an object was a chair. The autistic man would watch a movie and not ""get"" the emotional things happening because he barely paid attention to faces and didn't distinguish meaning from them. A new police officer, for example, in a time of distress where his heart is racing, he just finished chasing a man in his car for an hour, will become ""autistic"" so to speak because he ignores all cues and shoots a man to death. All he perceives is a threat and he forgets the person. A police officer with more experience will be able to ""thin slice"" the situation better in a matter of seconds and avoid an unecessary shooting.In order to be a good ""thin-slicer"", you probably have a lot of experience with what you are examining and it just becomes second nature. Some people are just naturally good at reading faces, predicting outcomes, and making those snap decisions that happen in the blink of an eye. Others, well, not as good! I feel that the book could use more focus, but overall, a good read.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the mysterious ways our minds work. "
424,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,3,"Won't do my typical long review for this book. I'm actually writing something more substantial that deals with these issues, so I'll save some of my energy for that. (And there is quite a bit more that needs reading). The short-short version of my usual long review is that Gladwell has some very good exploratory writing that he has written through anecdotes. This shouldn't surprise Gladwell fans. The problem with this book is that we never know whether he is intervening in the art vs. science debate, the intuitive vs. structured methods debate, or the rationalist vs. heuristic learning debate. If we were to read the book through any of these perspectives, unsurprisingly, the answer would be -- it all depends. Intuition can be the answer -- unless it's the problem. Intuition can be made better, through science. Unless our science is actually the problem, in that case, trust expert judgement (not necessarily the same thing as intuition, right?). The concepts get fuzzy. And actually, it seems like Gladwell is taking liberties with his subject matter to explore a range of things that might only be slightly related. One might take away from this book that we need to be aware of our own cognition, or that we need something called an epistemological frame. How do we know what we know? When is information too much information? When do we need rigor? When do we need to make a decision quickly? In any case, we're not sure what we're supposed to take away because the book hasn't quite settled into a fuller version of itself. That is my intuition as a writer. Gladwell has a second or third draft, but not quite a final draft. And that final draft might be a little beyond his capabilities. He might need a co-author, more time, or expertise to help his cause. There is a deep literature that deals with all of these subjects of epistemology, analytical failure, art vs. science (and so on). But since the book scrapes the surface of applied psychology, we're left with a few good stories and some things to think about. One has to remember that the author is a journalist and kind of intellectual voyeur -- thin-slicing is not only one of the topics of his book, it is also his profession. Not bad for a book written for a popular audience, but not great. "
425,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43449419-rawa-a,3,"This is going to be a very interesting review ..I was introduced to this book through Thinking, Fast And Slow and was very excited to read it; the idea is brilliant, it dwells on one of my favorite topics in psychology, and who doesn't want to have a deeper understanding of their own thought processes?It started with the Kouros story which was a great choice in my opinion to start the book with. In retrospect, it kind of summarized the whole book in a story format. One of my fav. I also really liked the idea of temporary autism and it's safe to say that it got me interested to the extent of wanting to know more about it and I honestly won't mind a book dedicated to it. The book also touched upon Priming in good details compared to other similar books. A huge chunk of the book, and by that I mean >70% of it, were examples to the ""Fast Thinking"" process, or the Blink in this book's terms, and if you've been reading my reviews you should realize by this point that I really love stories as examples as long as I get my share (I go with big portions here) of facts, science, and evidence based info. I was forced to compare the ""Blink"" to ""Fast Thinking"" introduced in Thinking, Fast And Slow, where the author in the later provided a huge deal of facts along with the multiple examples. I didn't find this in blink, in fact, I felt it's a good support for ""System 1"" (a synonym for fast thinking in the book's terms) , read before or after it to provide deeper understanding of it, it that is wanted. It won't have satisfied me at all as a standalone (maybe cuz I read the other book before it?)Another thing, the writer seemed a bit unsure, although he did lean more towards one of the opinions. Apart from repeating himself (and the incidents) a couple of times, he fluctuated between trusting our blink or going with deliberate thinking. Overall, this was a good read and I'll recommend it to others ✨."
426,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1698621-amy,4,"Fascinating book! I would describe Blink as promoting self-awareness more than self-help. It's a captivating exploration of the ability of our unconscious minds to accurately(much of the time)read the world around us. The psychological studies featured offered refreshing evidence that it isn't always in our best interest to slow down and think rationally. I wouldn't base an investment strategy on Gladwell's ""thin-slicing"" methods, but when it comes to matters of life and death, love, trust and marriage, oh, and battle tactics, Blink makes a convincing argument to ""go with our gut."" "
427,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49049055-parth-agrawal,4,"An awesome choice of title first of all as it aptly highlights the direction in which the present day decision making process is going towards. With increasing complexity and requirement of multi tasking, decision making is that one quality that every one yearns for. But the travesty of the truth is that very few are there amongst us who really know the process of decision making. Well I used to think that you sit, process and decide. That's one method ofcourse. The other one that comes to my mind is you run, slip, dash and just pick one from the options available to you with just hope, and logic being the last thing, on your side. ;pAdding to the joy, various experimental findings have been highlighted in the book forming the crux of the fun which I won't disclose here as it'll rob you off the fun in it. IN the book, author explicitly says that decision making process actually has two approaches. The first one that i mentioned above involves comprehension, cognition and lot of data crunching leading to the conclusion. But the underlying assumption in this process is that you have an unlimited supply of time (which is hardly ever the case). The second one that i mentioned above is called rapid cognition and in a cursory glance it would seem to you as a random act. We pick an option under such circumstance only when we know that picking is compulsory and we would be better off with a wrong choice rather than with no choice at all. If someone picks the right one, losers instantaneously brand it as luck by chance. What if i told you that even behind your rapid cognition, there is a basis. There's reason that you chose a particular option and only that option amongst all the options. It has a direct relation with the memories and experiences that have created your subconscious since you have stepped foot on this planet.The best example of this can be seen in our own society. If some guy is seen with a tattoo, long hair, ostentatious clothes, our mind immediately forms an image of him as someone who's born with a silverspoon or has no regards for the life he is living, he must be arrogant, impertinent etc etc. Where do all these ideas come from? They are nothing more than what we have been fed into our minds repeatedly and on a daily basis. In India, the organisational hierarchy of the family leaves little room for individual thought process and as an aftermath, the habit of questioning and curiosity goes down the drain. Cultural practices as such, leads to the creation of these kind of biases and prejudices which in turn has brewed a great deal of hypocrisy in our generation as the same characteristics that I mentioned above becomes desirable to an individual and even after he/she attains it, he/she remains contemptuous of the practice as a whole because that's what he/she has been fed with. How often have we seen that a guy in public transport even if mistakenly outrages the modesty of a female passenger, the crowd goes berserk and thrash the guy presuming that he must have had bad intentions. His pleas and requests fall upon deaf ears as people have already taken a snap judgement and no amount of explanation can convince them otherwise. Talking about all this brings us to a very important question. Are we slaves to our snap judgments? Can't we break free the shackles of biases and prejudices? To answer this, it is important to know that there is one big similarity between our conscious and subconscious thinking process. Both of them can be trained and taught through repetitive exercises only. It might be possible for some of you to think that since subconscious decision making is a quick process, training it will also be likewise but it isn't. Author substantiates this claim by quoting instances in the book in which body guards, police officers are provided training of this sort in which they control their adrenaline rush by repeatedly practicing in high-stress situations in which they learn to control their heart-rates, resisting their brains to keep the amount of input from dropping which ultimately helps them to take judicious action in such situations. Thomas Hoving, a curator, says that:"" I try my best to create best first impressions of the people, activity or an object during my first interaction as I believe that our subconscious is an untapped source of abilities and possibilities and it can be educated and trained in a manner such that we harness it for the greater good and for all this to happen, I need to have a positive frame of mind for every new experience of life."" Do you agree? I most certainly do;);).   "

We are desperately lacking in the latter.” (So true! What good is all the world’s info at our fingertips if we don’t have the wisdom necessary to properly execute it?)
429,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627983-mahlon,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written yet another thought-provoking book. In Blink he postulates that often our first impressions or gut instincts are more likely to lead us to the the correct decision than if we spent a long time gathering information and weighing out the pros and cons of the particular situation. In other words, you should ""trust your gut"" In trademark Gladwell fashion he uses many entertaining stories and case studies to illustrate his points, while at the same time cautioning against trusting your first impressions too much. I don't think his arguments are as well articulated as those in The Tipping Point, but I'll leave that up to the individual reader to decide for themselves.My previous complaints about Gladwell's organization, and the repetition of his writing are still valid. I find reading the beginning of one of his chapters to be a very enjoyable experience, but by mid-chapter I usually find the going excruciatingly slow, and by the end I feel as if I've been wandering around the desert for days, and have finally found my way back to civilization. Despite these minor flaws, at the end of his books I always find myself excited as to what his next project might be, and eager to share his insights with others. "

436,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explores the phenomenon he calls 'thin slicing'; the human ability to winnow out, in fractions of a second, salient facts from a mass of information and make a decision based on them. Something most of us do all the time without giving it much conscious thought – reading the facial expressions and body language of the people with whom we interact, walking down a busy street (or a quiet street late at night), our subconscious minds processing hundreds or even thousands of bits of information, deciding which few are important and making a judgement based on them.Gladwell illustrates his thesis using several extended examples. The first is relatively straight forward. In 1983 California's Getty museum was offered a 2500 year old Greek statue, a kouros, for $10 million. All the tests said it was genuine but several art experts, at first glance and without being able to say precisely why, knew it was a fake. He also tells the stories of how an ugly chair conquered the offices of the world, how we are all effected by racial conditioning, how Chicago's Cook County hospital improved diagnosis of heart attacks by removing a physician's knowledge from the process, how a commander using WWII technology defeated the combined might of the the US armed forces in the largest ever war game, and more.The author uses two main studies to demonstrate how this process of instant assessment works. John Gottman's 'love lab', where he gets couples to talk about a subject tangentially connected with their relationship and videos the exchange to bring out the non-verbal cues, and Paul Ekman, who is an expert of facial micro-expressions that last microseconds and over which we have no control (this latter also being the model for the excellent TV show Lie To Me with Tim Roth). Gladwell builds his argument convincingly and refers back to his examples frequently for both illustration and dramatic effect. Each example he uses shows a different facet of the Blink effect but also, and this is vital, how it can go wrong in certain circumstances.While it is quick, this subconscious ability does require a moment to work, and can be short circuited by rushing or by an overload of adrenaline. Another case study chillingly shows what can happen when our subconscious is not given the opportunity to work properly. In 1999 an unarmed, innocent man, Amadou Diallo, was shot 41 times in the entryway of his own New York apartment building, by four policemen. He shows how a lack of experience, over-hasty action and perhaps even the over-confidence of numbers allowed these policemen to fall back on crude stereotypes and allow an initial poor assessment to lead them down a tragic course of events.While Gladwell lauds the benefits of both listening to this subconscious supercomputer and developing the skills, in backing up the studies he constantly refers to the fact that this understanding has often been achieved by the exact opposite type of mentation – deliberate, analytical evaluation of evidence. This, along with the examples given, should show the reader that there are appropriate and inappropriate areas for this sort of thinking, although I can imagine some of the readership taking away only the face-value lesson of relying on first instincts and gut feelings. I would have liked to see a chapter on the abuse of these impressions, which is after all how con artists and frauds such as psychics operate. This could have been perhaps added into the chapter on Warren G. Harding, who was elected as US president because he was tall, handsome, masculine, dignified – and is considered by historians to be one of the worst presidents in US history. I want to take nothing away from this excellent book, however. It is superbly written, making excellent use of pacing and the storylines of the examples he uses to give the book structure. Malcolm Gladwell has a great style, authoritative and engaging, and he packs a great deal of both information and analysis into what is a quick, easy and enjoyable read."
437,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6738834-fay-al,4,"Most of us don't know how our decision making / thinking process works. Turns out we're on auto pilot more often than not. Imagine if you had to think routine tasks everyday: walking, manipulating basic objects, recognizing faces, language...etc that would be exhausting and would consume much needed energy.“The mind operates most efficiently by relegating a good deal of high-level, sophisticated thinking to the unconscious, just as a modern jetliner is able to fly on automatic pilot with little or no input from the human, ‘conscious’ pilot. The adaptive unconscious does an excellent job of sizing up the world, warning people of danger, setting goals, and initiating action in a sophisticated and efficient manner.”We think we fully control every decision, but that's only what your mind is leading you to believe..... what we think of as free will is largely an illusion: much of the time, we are simply operating on automatic pilot, and the way we think and act — and how well we think and act on the spur of the moment — are a lot more susceptible to outside influences than we realize.Well it turns out, it's not that straightforward or under our conscious control as much as we'd like it to be:Reading Blink enables one to have a better idea of how it all works and become aware of the biases/influences that cloud our judgment. And there's plenty of examples & experiments in the book that highlights our ""flawed judgment"". And I think what all of this also means is that we're vulnerable to anyone wishing to manipulate us given that they know how our minds work better than we do.One experiment mentioned in the book about facial expressions struck me as very interesting. The face is not just a projection of what we think and feel, it also works the other way around.They gathered a group of volunteers and hooked them up to monitors measuring their heart rate and body temperature — the physiological signals of such emotions as anger, sadness, and fear. Half of the volunteers were told to try to remember and relive a particularly stressful experience. The other half were simply shown how to create, on their faces, the expressions that corresponded to stressful emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear. The second group, the people who were acting, showed the same physiological responses, the same heightened heart rate and body temperature, as the first group.A few years later, a German team of psychologists conducted a similar study. They had a group of subjects look at cartoons, either while holding a pen between their lips — an action that made it impossible to contract either of the two major smiling muscles, the risorius and the zygomatic major — or while holding a pen clenched between their teeth, which had the opposite effect and forced them to smile. The people with the pen between their teeth found the cartoons much funnier. These findings may be hard to believe, because we take it as a given that first we experience an emotion, and then we may — or may not — express that emotion on our face. We think of the face as the residue of emotion. What this research showed, though, is that the process works in the opposite direction as well. Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process."
438,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028530-caron,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written a book about the power of first impressions (aka intuition/ your gut feeling). He provides a series of anecdotes about the process of first reactions including a tale about a forged ancient Greek statue at the Getty that some experts deemed as authentic and others classified as a fake upon sight. In another anecdote, he scrutinizes a ""couples lab"" where psychologist John Gottman determines if a matched pair will last the test of time by studying their conversation for 15 minutes - -he accurately predicts their fate about 90% of the time.Gladwell coins the term ""thin-slicing"" to capture these small snippets in time when a human judges a situation in an instant like a first date, hiring an employee, or meeting a new colleague. Human beings tend to take a first glance and ""thin-slice"" what they perceive through sight or interactions with the situation or individual. Rapid fire cognition is scary to many individuals and Gladwell believes that if ""we paid more attention to those fleeting moments...it would change the way wars are fought, the kinds of products we see on the shelves, the kinds of movies that get made, the way police officers are trained, the way couples are counseled...If you combine all those little changes together, you end up with a different and happier world."" How profound! He is attempting to bring psychology to the masses and does so artfully, choosing his words and sharping his ideas with high-interest examples to engage the reader. Gladwell further discusses ""priming,"" a term used to refer to subtle triggers that influence human behavior without any awareness of such changes (ex. Spain played classical music on subways and littering and vandalism decreased).The book incited much discussion with my book club membership- - thought provoking questions and topics selected from the Blink Reading Group Guide, but membership barely scratched the surface in their debate. This book caused the group to make many connections to their own lives and world. Conversation often digressed into self-reflective wondering or observations.Gladwell wants all readers to believe that intuition is often more reliable that reasoning and a series of data. But is that really the case? One criticism - he never addresses the brain in a scientific manner. In my own experience, I have learned (and am still learning) that I need to pay more attention to my intuition, my first gut instinct. I do not always think that ""thin-slicing"" is as reliable as collecting data and observations in many instances, but there is something to say about my first impressions of situations or people. I need to have more confidence about my ""gut impressions"" and have more faith in ME. Gladwell's book Blink substantiated that there is a certain degree of accuracy in my intuition. "

I read it amongst the ruins of ancient temples, on bumpy dusty tuk-tuk rides, I held on to it while on the boat waiting for the freshwater dolphins to crest the surface of the mighty Mekong, I read it while sitting cross legged on the floor of the aisle of a public bus on the 2-hour ride back to Siem Reap.But even without all that hazy semi-sense-of-adventure-backpacking state of mind... I would still recommend this book to anyone. Or any of Mssr Gladwell's books honestly speaking (up to the date of this review I have read them all except for 'Tipping Point' and 'David & Goliath', ironically -or maybe rather quite properly Gladwellian- the first & latest of his books). In a nutshell, this book is about how intrinsically we know things. But how all that is usually drowned out or pushed to the corner of ones mind by a lot of good old crusty 'preconception', 'social upbringing' and 'societal brainwashing'. But maybe it's not something that comes when we think about it. Anyhow the main concept/theory in this book is not bedrock to be sure, but somewhat elastic. Something to be taken with a grain of salt. Just as relying too much on facts and proof takes the fun out of life, not caring at all about facts and proof takes out the foundations of sound character. Trust your gut, people. Trust your gut. But don't try too hard."
440,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38240230-dawn,4,"Audiobook read by the author. I'm going to keep this review short but I'm going to say it is an easy read and definitely worth reading. Basically, it is about the information our brains and subconscious process in the 'blink' of an eye. It's surprising how our subconscious knows what is happening in a scenario before we do. Gladwell provided many different scenarios and anecdotal stories throughout the book that were fascinating and eye-opening. It's sad to learn that we all are quick to judge and have many different stereotypes imbedded in our subconscious and conscious. The author's own anecdotal story of when he grew his hair out and the things that happened to him as a result is crazy. And he just had longer hair. So imagine all the other factors that play into someone's appearance and the quick judgements our subconscious starts to make. But this book isn't just about stereotypes. I also found the section on analyzing married couples fascinating. An expert (I forget his name) is able to 'thin slice' a couple's interaction with each other and can tell with 90% accuracy if they will stay married or not. Maybe this would be a good tool for counselors and therapists to learn before couples get married? Definitely recommend. 4 stars."
441,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,3,"I seem to be destined to be disappointed by every book that I pick up these days. Perhaps I am just in a reading funk, but this book, too, left me a bit unsatisfied. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but the book was essentially a series of anecdotes about instinct. Gladwell may call it ""thin-slicing"" but the book is really about making snap judgments, stereotyping, if you will. It's the judgment that we make in the first few seconds of an interaction, a judgment made in the ""blink"" of an eye. Often, if not always, these judgments are more true than the ones made with greater reflection and we ignore these ""thin-slices"" at our peril. That, in a nutshell (or a thin-slice), is the thesis of this book. It is an interesting theory and one that I find amicable. My personal experience seems to confirm it. Still, I would have liked to see the whole thing fleshed out just a bit more. It just seemed a bit lightweight overall, but interesting as pop science. "
442,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1595511-kiri,5,"Fascinating! I have to admit, in the first chapter I had a little knee-jerk reaction when I thought he was saying that our intuitive reactions are invariably correct. As I continued to read I appreciated his skill in outlining the complexity of his theory, and the fact that only one who is trained in a particular field can really articulate what is happening in his or her unconscious decision-making process. He also explained how that unconscious reaction can be skewed by unrelated factors, thus completely disproving my knee-jerk disagreement."

Interesting theory will great stories to back it up. The key part for me touched on how you can decrease unconscious racist tendencies by exposing yourself to a more diverse group of people, and it really works!"
444,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28478188-eya-beldi,5,SO GOOOOOD! and Malcolm Gladwell excels again and again.Just the type of books I like it's under psychology type because it explains the subconsciousness but it's so good not boring because everything is explained with daily examples.10 stars out of 5!!!!

It is not to be confused with the unconscious described by Sigmund Freud, which was a dark and murky place filled with desires and memories and fantasies that were too disturbing for us to think about consciously. This new notion of the adaptive unconscious is thought"
446,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178887-max-stone,3,"The general topic was how powerful our initial impressions are because we can process stuff really quick at a subconscious level in some cases. Blink was well written and pretty entertaining. I thought the author did a good job of coming up with interesting examples of good or bad information processing and I enjoyed reading those. However, aside from writing style and some fun examples, I thought the content was quite neatly separable into two parts:  (a) stuff that was interesting and seemed true and which I knew already, and  (b) stuff that seemed untrue or at least incoherant and that I hadn't previously heard before. but maybe that was just my closed mind at work. Examples of (a) were how you one's initial impression (lke in the first 5 seconds) of a teacher or an interviewee are pretty highly correlated with your opinion after an hour.There were lots of examples of (b). Like it was weird that one of his first and favorite examples was this guy who had studied videos of couples interacting in intense detail for decades, and had created a list for how someone could score such videos to predict odds that the marriage would last. It was supposed to be an example of ""blink"" processing because the expert could recognize it quickly, but to me it seemed more like the opposite since (1) non-experts (including the author) all had inaccurate instinctive reactions to watching the videos, and (2) the best way to get the right answer was a mechanical scorecard -- kind of the opposite of blink.And in general, there were examples of when you should trust your blink instinct and when that was wrong, but all the examples of when it was right or wrong seemed very post hoc (e.g. if your heart rate is over some threshold you shouldn't, but I don't think that would have come up unless he needed some explanation for why accidental police shootings occured), and he didn't really have a consistent framework for when it would be right or wrong, which made it kinda useless. and some seemed random, like the part about some musicians that musical experts liked but that did poorly in the musical equivalent of blind taste tests -- seemed likely that it was a friend of the author or some musician he liked (it was clear in the book that we should take as a given that it was a good musician and that the taste tests were wrong -- I was never quite clear why) and he was just trying to think of some way that might connect to his thesis.I liked the description of how orchestras started doing blind auditions to avoid discrimination against women. wasn't sure that it supported his thesis, but it was interesting. that was more or less my reaction to the whole book."
447,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/997376-soma,5,"Both ""Blink"" and ""The Tipping Point"" are nonfiction writings that deal with social structures and human tendancies and the unassuming look at these.""Tipping"" is more a look at society on a large scale. It has to do with trends: what makes something popular and who is involved in that process and why it works. This isn't a look at advertising or corporate businesses (although the does look at those, too) but rather a journey into the dynamics and parts of these trends. It's an intriguing and well written book, ideal for anyone who wants to know how social trends work. It has pracitcal applications as well, if you have any desire to make social changes yourself.""Blink"" is more on a personal level, and looks at how our subconcious works and how important it is in our daily life and daily choices. This book is amazing, and I highly recommend it for everyone. ""Tipping"" is really interesting and carries some amazing social insights, but only applies directly to those who wish to institute change, ""Blink"" on the other hand is a must-read for anyone who has ever wondered why they make the split-second decisions they make and whether they're good or bad. Which I hope is everyone. Malcolm Gladwell has an amazing way of writing as though he was chatting over a cup of coffee. His books are full of amazing insight, research, and profound ideas that revolutionize the world we live it, but there is never a point that you feel lost, like these ideas are only something the smart kids can truly understand. Another thing I truly enjoy is his absolute lack of preachieness. His opinions are strongly stated, but never forced on you."

449,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28134808-nabilah-firdaus,4,"""We can learn a lot more about what people think by observing their body language or facial expressions or looking at their bookshelves.""Wow, this book definitely changed the way how I view myself, other people and things that have been happening around me.Basically, Blink tells us to trust our instinct, because instinct or first impressions are often more accurate than conclusions arrived at after much study and analysis. But be careful, though, because: When we make a second split decision, we are also very vulnerable to being guided by our stereotypes and prejudices, even ones we may not necessarily endorse or believe.So what is the practical solution to make a split second decision? This ability improves with practice. Apparently, our unconscious thinking is no different from our conscious thinking: in both, we are able to develop our rapid decision making with training and experience.Probably one of the best psychology books that I’ve read. A well researched and insightful read. Blink."
