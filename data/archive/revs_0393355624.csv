0,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162027-emily,2,"This book of anecdotes is written in a very casual, fun way that makes it easy to read. The problem is that the author, Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Dick Feynman, is annoying. All the anecdotes involve him discovering a hidden talent, using it, delighting others (or himself if that's his real goal) and then being applauded for it (sometimes only by himself). For example, he discovers that he's a great artist, musician, safecracker, and critic. Everything revolves around him showing off and being somewhat of a jerk. There were many times when I thought, yeah buddy, *you* think it's funny but no one else does. A few stories like this and it's quirky but piled on top of each other, it's annoying.I can't really recommend this book. Maybe mischevious self-aggrandizing guys would enjoy it but otherwise, I suggest a pass."

Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life, thought a series of stories.One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things. You would think a world-famous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics - but Feynman was curious about everything he saw. He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show, he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them, he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling, he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women, he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun - the list goes on! My take: you should have your passions - but you should also have your hobbies. I think I need a new hobby :)I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system. He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to. I think this is not a unique problem in education.Another lesson learned from Feynman's studies of science is to never take any data for granted. Always always question the sources. Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would re-generate many of the numbers on his own - even if they had been published in other places. For many things we are (and not just in science) standing on the shoulders of giants. The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with. I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist, with real integrity. And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles. This book was a light-hearted attempt to point that out - not to mention, a very entertaining read."

He was a man ahead of his time when it came to many things -- & of his time when it came to his ideas about 'pretty girls' (as he calls women). The audiobook reader did a great job, but what a shame Feynman didn't read it himself before he passed on..."

“Would you like cream or lemon in your tea, Mr. Feynman?” It’s Mrs. Eisenhart, pouring tea.“I’ll have both, thank you,” I say, still looking for where I’m going to sit, when suddenly I hear “Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Surely you’re joking, Mr. Feynman.”
The title of this collection comes from a tale that took place early in Feynman's career where he was invited for an afternoon tea with the dean of his university. The dean's wife is serving and asks him the above question. Richard never drinks tea and never moves in the same society that does, little own the society that has lemon OR cream with it. A big theme of these stories and indeed a running theme in Feynman's life is that he had no time for formalisms, rituals or societal views. He does attribute a lot of this to his upbringing. His father was a uniform maker and often dealt with clients of all types of notoriety and he knew that underneath all those uniforms were just another naked ape. He passed on his views to his children and Richard went so far as to nearly not accept his Nobel Prize. To him it was another form of bullshit and that his reward had already been awarded with other scientists using his findings.It's no argument that Feynman was a brilliant physicist, but he also had many interests. And a great proportion of these stories are about these interests or how his interests intersected with his physics work. There is only one story in this collection that is technical in any way. The collection reads as if you had somehow run into Feynman in a seedy bar in 1960s Vegas (there's a story about this time) waiting for a showgirl to finish work. He is a great orator and the origins of these stories are that they were recorded and transcribed by Ralph Leighton, a drumming pal of Richard's. Yes, Feynman played the bongos. So while you have this brilliant man, in some ways ahead of his time in the ways that he thought and how he acted, there ares some hints that he is a man of his time. Reading these stories you come to realise that Feynman was quite the womaniser. He appreciated the female form in a socially acceptable way for the time that he lived in. And so when someone from the twenty-first century reads this book he can come across as a bit sleazy. I am not going to defend his attitudes nor am I going to condone them. Personally I found nothing overtly offensive about his actions or his attitudes. But I can imagine my partner reading this and sighing at several statements made by him. The book covers times in his childhood right up until late in life. There is a nice large chapter on his time at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project. There are also stories about his time in Brazil and Japan and his love for immersing himself in a different way of life. There are also a couple of great chapters on education; one about the standard of students he sees while in Brazil and the other concerning a time when he was asked to be on a panel to decide high school texts for his school region. I'd recommend this read to most people. It is extremely accessible, with little jargon or technical physics. It talks more on his philosophy of living, learning and how to deal with the world around you. He is definitely a great orator and that is why his legacy lives on. This book remains a popular seller in the general sciences and recordings of his lectures and interviews are popular on youtube. It's great to know that we still have so much of him around.And for those who want more there are plenty more collections of his wisdom. There is also Feynman a biographic graphic novel."

I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.” ― Richard Feynman, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!I've been circling this book, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, and Gleck's Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman for awhile. This one seemed the most fun and easiest place to start. I was driving from Taos/Santa Fe back to Phoenix last week and as I drove past Los Alamos, it was just the particle collision in my brain I needed to start on Feynman.Often, memoirs are hard to read because you know a bunch of it is façade. A person is showing you a part of them for a purpose. They want to be viewed as smart, important, funny, etc. They carefully guide you through a Potemkin village of their life. Richard Feynman's memoir is different. Not that I don't think Feynman had an ego. He might have even had an agenda with the book. But, for the most part, he seemed much more interested in the stories he wanted to tell, rather than on how they would make him look. He wasn't all that worried about how he looked so much. His entire life was built around doing what he wanted, exploring what he found interesting, violating taboos, beating his own drums and cutting his own path. He was a Nobel-prize winning polymath physicist whose other talents included playing drums, teaching, drawing naked girls, picking locks, making atomic bombs, practical jokes, and telling stories. He wasn't interested in the usual trappings of success. Many of those things annoyed him. He was curious. He was a risk-taker. He was a genius."

When I read this book, I almost feel that Feynman's telling the stories himself. Well, when that happens in real life, you always want to join in; here's my personal best effort at a Feynman-type anecdote. I hope it's now far enough in the past that the people concerned will see the funny side, if they happen to stumble across this page by accident!STAR TREK AND THE PERSONAL SATELLITE ASSISTANTIt was early 2000, and I had just started working at NASA Ames Research Center in California. I was part of this little group that was supposed to be developing spoken language dialogue systems for space applications. The guy whose idea it was had started up the group, recruited me and two other people, and then left to join Microsoft Research before I'd even arrived. So everyone was looking at us suspiciously. Why did NASA need software that you could talk to?The rest of this review is available elsewhere (the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons)"
6,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56447132-william,5,"""Nobody ever figures out what life is all about,and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.""(Video Review) The story of Feynman changed fundamentally, what I think about the world around me.The story of Richard and his father helped me to understand, that many parents could help their children to a more fulfilling life. Parents could pique the interest of the child very early and could give him real answers if he asks why again and again.He changed my view about scientists. He proved that the life of a scientist can be also “sexy” and interesting and the same time useful and deep activity. You rarely have a chance to meet pedagogues who can help you fall in love with learning and set the fire of science in you, as Feynman did.This book is not only interesting for physicists and scientists, but also for parents and pedagogues who want to inspire their children, students to have a better life. Elon Musk (founder of Tesla) founded a school build on the same principles what Feynman confessed. Where children have a chance to understand the thing work around us, understand the “whys”, and continuously maintain the interest of the students.Of course many people cannot afford this luxury. But also they can profit from these pedagogical principles, even if these seems to be terrifying at the first time as a parent. If you encourage your child to question anybody, you will be also questioned. If you encourage your child, not to defer to different orders, it questions basic societal values of many people and they can be stigmatized being unrespectful. But I think, you will only show a path for your child, which even can lead to the Nobel-prize, but to a happier, more interesting life. And now I am surely not joking."

I'll never make that mistake again, reading the experts' opinions. Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that's the end of you.
I can usually tell when I’m going to give a book 5 stars by one sign: I can’t shut up about it. Well, I couldn’t and can’t shut up about this book; it was simply great. This greatness sort of snuck up on me. I’d recently read a collection of anecdotes by a scientist (A Primate’s Memoir) and found it rather disappointing. Plus, the whole idea of reading a book of stories about a great physicist, without learning any actual physics, seemed silly. But my skepticism had withered away by the end of the first chapter; I was entranced by the man, absolutely fascinated, and remained so the whole time.The subtitle of this book is perfect, because the two meanings of the word “curious” converge to encapsulate Feynman: he was curious in the sense of being odd, as well as curious in his love of learning. I was trying to figure out a way to describe Feynman’s personality, and this is the best I’ve come up with: Feynman is Huck Finn grown up to become a physicist. The qualities that make Mark Twain’s most famous character so endearing are also the qualities that endear Feynman to me: mischievousness, curiosity, cleverness, honesty, naiveté, friendliness, frankness, and an uncompromising moral principle. Like Huck, Feynman is always getting himself into absurd situations, and getting out of them with pure quickness of mind; like Huck, Feynman likes to fool other people and play tricks, but all without a hint of malice; and like Huck, Feynman will stick his neck out for what he feels is right.There are some hilarious stories in here, which I won’t spoil. But what was more impressive to me was the amount of serious thought that could be found. Feynman’s criticism of the Brazilian school system—which relied overmuch on memorization by rote, and concentrated overmuch on passing tests, instead of teaching students how to make sense of the world around them—applies equally well to many aspects of the current U.S. school system. Equally relevant was Feynman’s chapter on the time he served on the board that oversaw the evaluation of math textbooks for the California school system; it was a Kafkaesque farce. But by far the most consistent intellectual theme that went through these reflections was an absolute distrust of pretension, reputation, convention, snobbery, prestige, and authority.In my own life, one of the most interesting, and also most difficult, lessons that I’ve had to learn is that people are not nearly as competent as they’d like you to believe. When I was a kid, I had a lot of faith in all sorts of things. I thought that if an ‘expert’ said something, it must be true; I assumed that there was a particular ‘expert’ in every type of activity, be it business or science, to ensure that things ran the way they were supposed to. In short, I had the comforting illusion that very smart people in very white lab coats were behind the scenes, ensuring that things ran smoothly. The world certainly cooperated with this illusion for a while (after all, that’s the whole basis of advertising); but it wasn’t long after meeting people in the ‘real world’ that this illusion imploded: the world is run by people underqualified and overconfident.I include this bit about myself because I don’t think I would have reacted so emotionally to this rather lighthearted book were it not that I had that experience. In a way, a distrust of all authority is Feynman’s central social message. He is constantly running into ‘experts’ who haven’t the slightest idea what they’re talking about. He goes to academic conferences full of pretentious windbags; he trusts the results of other people’s experiments, and later finds that they were seriously flawed.So any time somebody makes a claim, he decides to test it out for himself; and the few times he doesn’t do this, he gets into trouble. This realization, that most people are inclined to trust claims from authority, is integral to his almost supernatural ability to navigate unfamiliar situations; Feynman is so easily able to bluff his way through because people take his word for things. So this central insight—to always check for youself—is both the heart of his scientific attitude, as well as his way of effortlessly gliding through the world. His ability to crack safes, for example, wasn’t due to his knowing a lot about safes, but simply realizing that most people used their safes foolishly, not resetting the factory combination or setting it to something obvious. Most of us assume that we couldn’t figure out how to crack a safe; but Feynman did what he always did, and saw for himself whether he could: and he could!I honestly wish that this book was three times its length. Now, I must know more about Feynman. My favorite saints are the ones who would hate to be worshiped, and Feynman certainly would think this glowing review was nonsense. Well, perhaps it is; but the only way you’ll know for sure is by reading this book, and checking for yourself."
8,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,5,"Fellers, lemme tell you about one of the smartest sumbitches to ever walk the earth by way of narrative aid. Picture this:  You’ve covered yourself from head to tippy-toe in Vaseline, you’ve been grappling with the concept of higher dimensions all damn night. Engaging in repeated bouts of what could only be described as a physical profanity spawned from the unholy body-karate of Turkish Oil Wrestling, Passive Aggressive Pole Dancing, and Non-Euclidean Interpretive Dance, has sapped you of vital cognitive nutrients. You’re demoralized. There’s no way you’ll understand this. You’re so dumb you couldn’t pour piss out of a boot if the instructions were written on the heel. You might as well give up. Belching forth a line of caustic invectives, you rail against the deities of genetic inheritance, ideal geographic/home conditions, nurturing parents, free access to information, money, wonderful teachers, proper nutrition, interesting peer groups, and lead paint. Then you collapse. During the course of your angry nap, you experience a fitful dream. You’re in the midst of a grueling marathon. Your muscles are bathed in acid. Your lungs are a frozen ball of expanding gas crowding out your innards. With tremendous effort, and cussing so foul memory doesn’t permit you to recall it, you crest a hill. Off in the distance, you see the smartest people you know in your personal life, implacably approaching the finish. You realize that, with enough training, you could bridge the cognitive divide between you and them. “If I just buckle down and learn my multiplication tables, I can run shoulder to shoulder with Sara and Jimbo.” You think. They’re not so different from you, they just didn’t spend six months re-watching The Jersey Shore. This thought lightens all your burdens. You push on with renewed spirits. Nothing can stop you now.  Well, don’t get carried away chief, because you stagger across the finish line like a spastic newborn giraffe doing the Butterfly and proceed to void your bowels, which is just damn embarrassing. But you made it. By Jove you made it! At that moment, a man comes trotting by your fetal form. His steps are springy and there’s a curious clinking noise that accompanies his gait. He’s got a mischievous grin and intelligent eyes. He doesn’t appear to be sweating and his breathing is relaxed. How curious, you think. Well, at least you beat one person in this godawful pummeling of pavement. “Tough break, my man.” You offer your condolences to the stranger as he sails past you with a good natured laugh. “That’s Richard Feynman.” Someone says. “Poor bastard.” You cough. “That’s his tenth lap. He just does this shit for fun.” As the peculiar man recedes into the periphery, you catch a glint of metal. Beneath his shorts you see what appear to be cybernetic ostrich legs.Well, shit, that wasn’t as uplifting as I intended it to be. My point is: There’s smart people that you can imagine emulating through linear improvements, and then there are people like Richard Feynman, who are a different kind of athlete (and arguably a damned cheater). If you read this book you’ll come to know a bit about an affable rascal, a maverick, a first principles thinker with a wicked sense of humor who was insatiably curious about the natural world. A person who wasn’t comfortable with understanding anything superficially, or expressing it in a nauseatingly ostentatious way. He had a low tolerance for horseshit, saying a lot that means very little, (forgive me, Dick), sloppy reasoning, people pretending to know things they can’t possibly know, and making things more complicated than they need to be. Here is a brief (far from exhaustive) list of things he applied his alien intellect to:Quantum Electrodynamics.Statistical Mechanics.Parallel ComputingRadio construction and repair.Playing bongo drums.Superfluidity.Criticizing the educational system’s emphasis on rote memorization.Quarks.Painting.Participating in humanity’s potential swan song at Los Alamos.Safe cracking.Taking a cudgel to uppity philosophers.Teaching.Sussing out bureaucratic and engineering malfeasance in the wake of The Challenger Disaster.Coercing ants to follow pheromone trails.Cultivating an eccentric personality which makes for an interesting portfolio of anecdotes which comprise the bulk of this book.Threatening to piss through a man in a bar bathroom.Metabolizing oxygen.Offering the best quote of all time on his death bed. “I’d hate to die twice. It’s so boring.”Feynman is a personal hero of mine, and this is one of the greatest autobiographies ever written. It is genuinely funny, and if you come away from it without wanting to know more about how things really work, well, you’re dead to me. Let’s go out with a quote, because I’ve exhausted my word-bag.“It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn’t get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.”Despair of your position on the continuum of human intellect with this book!"
9,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/300186-penny,5,"Feynman is a physicist who taught at Cornell and Princeton, worked on the Manhattan Project and won the Nobel Prize. He's also a complete hoot. The book is a series of autobiographical stories -- pranks pulled as a student at MIT and at Los Alamos, teaching himself to paint, scientific discoveries he made, his three marriages, how he was rejected by the draft board for being mentally suspect (they asked him if he ever heard voices and he said yes he did and then went on to describe what he found interesting about that. He said that sometimes when falling in and out of sleep he'd imagine conversations with his foreign-born colleagues and the voices in his head spoke accurately with their accents -- but that if he tried to imitate such accents he could not do so at all. So how was it that one part of his brain had captured accents correctly but another hadn't? This was entirely typical of Feynman's wide ranging curiosity and intelligence, but the end result in this case was that the psychologists decided he was nuts. His colleagues at Cornell were vastly amused by this.)What I love about Feynman -- first of all, his great interest in everything and his willingness to experiment. The great joy he found in working things through (he said that the reason he'd never tried drugs, though he was tempted, was that he enjoyed thinking too much and didn't want to risk that.) Also, he's clearly so very intelligent and reading his book, his thoughts seem so easy to follow -- it makes the world of science seem accessible."
10,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,3,"There’s presumably a rule where only smart people are awarded Nobel Prizes in Physics. Richard Feynman was no exception. This memoir is filled with anecdotes from his childhood spent fixing radios, his experiences as a young man doing bomb research at Los Alamos up through his days as a renowned professor at Cal Tech. The central theme was always that this is one smart cookie. It was interesting to pick up on his thought processes. It probably didn’t feature as much pure science as most of his other books, but at least you could appreciate his intuition into the physical world’s biggest puzzles. Rather than emphasizing the technical details of physics, most of his stories were focused on his other interests and his geeky humor.While some of the stories were entertaining, and the lumens of candle power abounded, it didn’t always work for me. I kept getting the feeling that had the same stories been told in the third person, they would have been better – less egotistical sounding. In every one of his sidelines, he was masterful. It was like he was still driving home the point of how brilliant he was even when he was slumming it. After a while, I got tired of hearing how he became fluent in Portuguese when he taught in Brazil, or impressed the locals to no end with his distinctive style of bongo playing, or could dance like a professional, or got just about any woman he wanted to sleep with him. It was this last one that left the worst taste in my mouth. Some of his tales of attraction and conquest occurred when one of his wives was on her death bed. He was probably not as bad as I’ve made him sound. Like I said, we can certainly appreciate his intellect. He had a rare ability to explain difficult concepts in laymen’s terms, too. I got a confirmation of this a week after I finished the book when we were interviewing a former student of his from Cal Tech. He mentioned the “Feynman Effect”: a phenomenon whereby someone asking him a question got answered in such a clear and intuitive way that it was only later that they realized they still didn’t know exactly how it all tied to their existing understanding.So, count me as a fan of his scientific contributions and his ability to communicate, but not of his swagger. If it had all been a bit of a joke (you know, physicist … funny hair … limited social skills … but a would-be Lothario in spite of it), I would have laughed along with him, but I don’t think that was his intention. "
11,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/995651-nick,1,"One of the problems with reading a book written by a genius is that you have to ask yourself whether any perceived deficiencies in the text are due to the author, or due to your own failure to comprehend his brilliance. That said, I wasn't thrilled by this book. On a purely technical level, it would have benefited from a stronger editor. While there's a rough chronological order to the material, there tends to be a lot of jumping around both within and between the chapters. A few times, Feynman would relate some post-WWII anecdote, only to jump back to something that happened during his time at Los Alamos in the early 1940s. He'll mention that he divorced his second wife, and then shortly thereafter tell a story set during the marriage. It gives the book a very disjointed quality.On a more personal level, Feynman just doesn't strike me as someone you'd want to spend time with. About 30% of his stories talk about a time he pulled a fast one on somebody, or how he did something arrogant and obnoxious and it developed into an incident. Reading this book feels like babysitting a very rambunctious toddler--as amusing as his antics may be, you're can't help but looking forward to it being over. And while it's perhaps unfair to judge his behavior by modern standards, some of the womanizing and borderline misogyny (as when he decides that the best way to pick up women in bars is to treat them badly and call them whores) is a bit disappointing. Feynman's scientific accomplishments may be beyond reproach, but I doubt I'll spend any more time with his memoirs."
12,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9974807-tess-j,1,"Listen, I read this a long time ago but here's the thing about it. I'm a big sience fan, and I've always heard how brilliant and funny Richard Feynman was, especially because of his connection to the UofC. But I loathed this book. I suppose it's a memoir, and I don't know if it's ghost written or not, but what was supposed to endear me to Mr Feynman made him revolting to me. According to this book, he treated other people like dirt and thought it was hilarious, he correlated pure intelligence with worth, and he dismissed and disrespected everyone who he felt was not as intellectual as he was (and being that he was a genius, that was most of everybody). Perhaps this is melodramatic, but he sickened me a touch. His blatant disrespect for the work of other scholars in the guise of a patronizing outlook is wholly demoralizing, and for people who wished to pursue a degree in the sciences under him I can't even imagine what it was like to deal with his pomp and ego. I know that the persona displayed in memoirs is different than the actual personality of a person, but the gleeful manner in which he presents his attitude does nothing to disprove my issues with his style. "
13,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,2,"The Nobel prize winning physicist, acclaimed drummer, artist, expert on Mayan astronomy, safecracker, prankster, etc, etc, tells “crazy adventures” of his life. They’re really not “crazy adventures,” these anecdotes; my own father's are easily just as rich and bizarre. Feynman came off to me as a somewhat unpleasant character: he was full to the brim of himself; his false modesty (“I’m too dim to realize when to keep my mouth shut, I just say what I think”) was cloying and annoying, as were his amazement at anyone else’s talent (a professional drummer is far better than him at the drums; this “shocks” him), his claims to understand nature better than artists, and his thinly-veiled put-downs of anyone even remotely concerned with the abstract. He was just the kind of jerk who, caught up in his criticism of others’ inability to grasp his broad points, never begins to wonder whether he is the one missing the gist. Also, his anecdotes are not fleshed out with context: who exactly are the people he’s talking to? When was this? I don’t care. In all, funny and interesting at times (at Los Alamos, on a committee to select school text books), but mainly kind of mundane."
14,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80479-peter-frazier,5,"This amusing little book of anecdotes had an alarmingly influential role in my life. It convinced me of the odd notion that it would be a good idea to go to Caltech and major in physics. In retrospect, this would have been a better idea had I been born around 1930 and was starting my scientific career around 1940, but nowadays it's a tough slog in physics, both money-wise and also discovery-wise. I think that people like Bohr and Planck and Einstein and Feynman discovered all the good stuff in physics and that future theory will be more difficult and less beautiful (though perhaps these string-theorists put my foot in my mouth). I wish I had realized all this when I was 17 rather than 24, but all is not lost: physics is wonderful training for all manner of mathematical disciplines, and all has worked out for the best. I retain a deep fondness for this book, and rereading old passages brings me comfort. If you ever have the choice between reading this book and doing something productive and worthwhile, I recommend that you read this book. All will work out for the best for you too."
15,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder,4,"Laugh out loud funny. My dad read this outloud to us when we were kids - I'm guessing at the exact year - and the whole family literally cried with laughter many times during the performance. Feyman's other memoirs are good too, but this is the funniest. I still think of it often. For instance, every time I use a combination lock, I think of his safe-cracking phase, and how it's every child's dream to learn how to crack safes and get at all that secret and valuable stuff. Which really sums up this book - Mr. Feyman approached life with the curiosity and glee of a small boy. He never lost that childlike sense of wonder or mischief.My only caveat - Mr. Feyman was quite the ladies' man, and there is a certain old-school misogyny in his style of writing about women. Looked at in the most charitable light possible, it's a reminder that he was human, as well as a genius physicist, and frankly, not always right. It doesn't make him any less of an amazing physicist, but it does remind us that he was mortal too.And after reading all of his memoirs, I began to suspect that his cavalier attitude towards women arose at least in part from his grief at the loss of his first wife, who died of cancer at a very young age (her early 20s, if I remember correctly), while he was busy working on the nuclear bomb in Los Alamos. She is the only woman he writes tenderly about - after that, the talk shifts to conquests and getting girls naked. His descriptions of his subsequent marriages lack the warmth of that first marriage, even if there is more fodder for humor. Something about it rings hollow even in Feyman's warm, humorous, self-deprecating voice. There is a real tragedy written between the lines here."
16,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2467151-elizabeth-k,2,"This was disappointing, because I've been wanting to read this for a while because he is so renown for being quite the hilarious character as well as a Nobel prize-winning physicist. This is a collection of essays that serves as a memoir; many are not directly related to physics, but that's definitely the theme. After reading this, my conclusion is that Feynman was mostly a world class knob. He lost me fairly early into it, when he described how you could see physics in action in the everyday world by messing with a waitress's tips. How very droll of you, Mr. Feynman. He is certainly quite the character in the same sense your annoying neighbor is quite the character, the kind who sees you unloading your groceries from the car and saunters over to give you pointless advice about his expert analysis on the best way to unload groceries without helping you, driving you to grit your teeth and nod as you flee toward your door because anything you might say in response, such as ""shut UP, annoying guy!"" would result in him saying ""Aw shucks, I can't help it that I'm smarter than you."" Many demerits for egregious overuse of the exclamation point.Grade: C-Recommended: Not really, although the essays set during his time at Los Alamos are somewhat interesting given the historical context. I suppose it's possible he really was charming and amusing in real life, but you wouldn't know it from his writing."

18,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,5,"What a fascinating personality! To follow your dreams, make them happen, make a living out of them, ultimately all this work to be of help for others and above all to enjoy life as you wish to - this is what I call to live your life to the fullest! Mr. Feynman stories are simply wonderful! They are not just funny - they present a man which desire to learn was his motto in life (he owes this desire to his father, a very remarkable man). According to him, anything can be learned as long as you wish for - so very true. If all pupils and students would have teachers like him, the world would be a much better place... I think the saying ""like father, like son"" emerged from their relationship. ;)Some called him corky; others arrogant - and maybe he was. But who are we to judge? I don't think it was easy for him to work on the atomic bomb project - the pressure, the implications... even brilliant minds need a getaway of some form. Maybe when we'll do the things he did we'll get to have a word on this matter. Until then, lets just admire his passion, his dedication and his work.The book does not contain scientific language, calculations or anything alike. Even if you're not interested in physics, this book is more than worth reading. Such a life experience not many can say they had...One more thing: I came across on below interview, produced by BBC in 1981, called The Pleasure Of Finding Things Out. 50 minutes length, worth every second of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgaw9... . It is a shorter version of his memoirs presented in the book and the following fragment is a part of it: People say to me, “Are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?” No I am not. I am just looking to find out more about the world. And if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law that explains everything so be it. That would be very nice discovery. If it turns out it’s like an onion with millions of layers and we just sick and tired of looking at the layers then that’s the way it is! But whatever way it comes out it’s nature, it’s there, and she’s going to come out the way she is.If you decide to put it on your to-read list, I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did :)"

He has been a hero of mine since I was very young, probably because my father also greatly admires him and spoke to me about Feynman and his unique personality from time to time.There are some great stories in this book and they will make you laugh out loud. Feynman was always so full of life and he was curious about absolutely everything from a very early age. He would always want to know, ""How does that work?"" or ""Why is that the way it is?"" or ""Is there another way to do that?"" He would also latch onto something and decide that he wanted to do it, and to do it really well. For example, witnessing the bongo-playing in Brazil inspired him to learn to play like that and not like some studio-taught purist. He achieved it through dedication to his objective and sheer passion.What made Feynman a genius? Well, there were lots of factors that contributed to his status, many of them discussed in other reviews of this book, but, my reason for putting him into that classification was that he was capable of explaining the most complex of matters to a five-year-old. That is TRUE genius.I have read this book many times. It is a short book and will remain amongst my collection until the day that I die. If you haven't read it already, you should. You really need to read this book. I can guarantee that it will change at least one aspect of your life!"

This is a captivating story of an amazing life that could not have been better had it been scripted at birth.Mr. Feynman has done it all. I loved the feeling of tagging along on this brilliant, Nobel-prize winning physicist’s life. A little eccentric yes, but the narrative flows in a very conversational manner (which is a style I like very much). From his early life, to his work on the atomic bomb, to his ability to crack safes, I could not help but admire his chutzpah and proven success. This ""nerd"" even had tremendous success with the ladies. Therefore, on behalf of nerds everywhere, you are our hero!He, like Robert Todd Lincoln, was always lucky enough to be at the right place at the right time in history. The difference is that Feynman tended to be around for the more auspicious historical events. Truly, there are not enough adjectives to describe his amazing talents, admirable life, and impressive success. Among the many biographies I’ve read, only one other person gets this summation, “Remarkable...a life well lived.” That person? Abigail Adams"
21,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,4,"This collection of stories was a tad bit uneven, but overall a helluva lot of fun! Feynman’s childlike curiosity and enthusiasm are infectious; he was a really likeable guy. With respect to math and science, Feynman made some excellent points about the dangers of rote memorization. People often mistakenly think that they’ve grasped something, but they’ve merely memorized facts rather than genuinely understood the thing conceptually. He also pointed out that with science, as with life in general, it is important to PLAY. We tend to lose sight of this far too often.As you’d expect, there is an abundance of humor in these anecdotes. My favorite funny part was when Feynman got into his first fight in a bar:
“One time I was in the men’s room of the bar and there was a guy at the urinal. He was kind of drunk, and said to me in a mean-sounding voice, ‘I don’t like your face. I think I’ll push it in.’I was scared green. I replied in an equally mean voice, ‘Get out of my way, or I’ll pee right through ya!’”
Best response ever."
22,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-romanas,5,"This is the manual of curiosity and intelligence by the great physicist -- Richard Feynman. An incredible life of one of the prodigious thinkers is summarized in less than 400 pages. I would not have put it down even if the book was 4000 pages long, so interesting is the story, a real page-turner.Apparently, by not taking life so seriously Dr. Feynman achieved some remarkably serious things which led to Nobel prize, and other remarkable accomplishments. How many other Nobel prize laureates have safe cracking as a hobby? The book is not just an entertaining story about an extraordinary life. The reader will find some invaluable wisdom about the essence of science, curiosity, creativity, teaching, science ethics, and life morals.I knew, believed, and always felt that curiosity is an essential ingredient of a purposeful life. Feynman, by his life, proved the point. For everybody seeking inspiration and curious about one of the most curious, and where it all might lead, this is a charming book which will probably be a jump-start to other Feynman’s books."
23,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3864006-pooja-dhami,5,"Before I read this engaging memoir, I knew him as Richard Phillips Feynman, one of the greatest physicists that ever lived. Henceforth, this name will evoke images of a prankster, a musician, a safe cracker, a biologist, a Brazilian band member, an artist who visited several brothels to sell his painting and a man who refused to grow old. These anecdotes from his life are sure to tickle your funny bone."

It’s obvious that they have a high functioning mind, which is the cause of such provocative mischievousness, and what follows next is what we already know, when they are constantly being told by their teachers! “You better use your mind to score good grades”.I think that’s the problem with our education system. It leaves no space for free thinking, it doesn’t let the students to think differently and to let them learn by experiments, by failed attempts, this is why most of us begin to lose interest in science because what we learn doesn’t really stay with us for a long time, since we don’t even understand the whys and hows behind the things!What makes a wind-up toy go? I thought, “I know what it is: They’re going to talk about mechanics, how the springs work inside the toy; about chemistry, how the engine of the automobile works; and biology, about how the muscles work.”If this makes you wonder why you never had a teacher who made you question everything and in turn made the process of learning interesting, then this book is for you! Professor Feynman (with his puzzle drive for discovering what’s the matter with things to figure out what to do to fix it) is the teacher you are looking for!This book is not an autobiography in its absolute sense, it’s rather a recollection of the adventures of a curious character which will give you a new world view to understand the genius behind a prankster and his indignant impatience with pretentious pompous fools and their hypocrisy.Its hilarious anecdotes (which are divided into wacky yet fascinating chapters) of fixing radio by thinking, stealing a door, learning biology with a map of a cat, fooling safecracker by safecracking, testing bloodhounds, not making decisions by refusing offers, receiving Nobel prize for the pleasure of discovering what he did, drawing and selling his beautiful artworks and learning to be an occasional jerk to women to get laid and playing with ants and bongo professionally, will surely hook you till the end.Like all smart people he might come across as a narcissist but if you have an admiration for geeky humour coupled with a razor-sharp wit and are curious enough to understand what sets his thought process apart from his brilliant peers, you might discover Feynman techniques to learn how to maintain an open but skeptical mind to look at things differently and your life will never be the same again!Following are the few things that I learned from this book, which I will never forget!You should have your passions – but also have some hobbies and strive to be extremely good at them by being really interested and keep on practising till you learn to do it fairly well, be attentive, use your own knowledge to try it differently from what is usually the practice. Learn from people around, don’t fear to experiment, gain new experiences, so that you have a story to tell, be notorious to exercise your brain but never hurt anyone. Be considerate and helpful! Learn how things work and to truly understand something, question why it is the way it is, what’s its use. Don’t memorize the definition of words and formulas but learn its application, learn with the help of examples and always make sure that the source of knowledge you are using is correct, always cross-check it by yourself. Learn what the rest of the world is like because the variety is always worthwhile."

Made me take interest in physics around us again. :)Feynman was surely a man of multiple lives, how could anybody live so much? Physicist, safe cracker, artist, frigideira (an instrument used in Samba music) player, nobel prize laureate, drummer, and more. His mischievous nature and varied interests (exploration of hypnotism and sense deprivation, e.g.) were inspiring in a way.As a scientist, he leaves out important messages primarily in the chapters: O Americano, Outra Vez! (later part, pg. 211 onwards, about state of science education in Brazil at the time); Is Electricity Fire? (on Jewish (dis)interest in science); Judging Books by their Covers (review of school math books, and disappointment obtained from them); and lastly, Cargo Cult Science, the last chapter.A must read for any science-loving person."
26,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10976459-irena,4,"This book's been recommended to me by my boyfriend and after giving it a 5-page trial, I got sucked right into it!I partially read it, partially listened to the audiobook (which was, imho, done really well and was so pleasant to listen to while doing puzzle or gaming or whatnot).I loved the very beginning, his childhood, where he was so curious and so sweet about his early discoveries. The rest of his science-related work as well as hobbies (drumming, painting, lock-picking, math duels, pranks, school book selection and more) can be preeety much summarized to..well, this picture:Feynman was definitely no bore. I love his way of everyday thinking: so practical, stripped of any tedious theorizing and philosophical blabber. Like in that part where he visits the biology department and find out that all the students memorize so many facts by heart when they could just look it up quickly. So I went to the librarian in the biology section and asked her if she could find me a map of the cat. ""A map of the cat, sir?"" she asked, horrified. ""You mean a zoological chart!"" From then on there were rumors about some dumb biology graduate student who was looking for a ""map of the cat.""  When it came time for me to give my talk on the subject, I started off by drawing an outline of the cat and began to name the various muscles. The other students in the class interrupt me: ""We know all that!"" ""Oh,"" I say, ""you do? Then no wonder I can catch up with you so fast after you had four years of biology."" They had wasted all their time memorizing stuff like that, when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes.""It's a really interesting, easy read - I really enjoyed this one, both in written and in audio form. And my most favourite part:  When I sat with the philosophers I listened to them discuss very seriously a book called Process and Reality by Whitehead. [...]First of all, I sat there without saying anything, which is almost unbelievable, but also true. A student gave a report on the chapter to be studied that week. In it Whitehead kept using the words ""essential object"" in a particular technical way that presumably he had defined, but that I didn't understand. After some discussion as to what ""essential object"" meant, the professor leading the seminar said something meant to clarify things and drew something that looked like lightning bolts on the blackboard. ""Mr. Feynman,"" he said, ""would you say an electron is an 'essential object'?"" Well, not I was in trouble. I admitted that I hadn't read the book, so I had no idea of what Whitehead meant by the phrase; I had only come to watch. ""But,"" I said, ""I'll try to answer the professor's question if you will first answer a question from me, so I can have a better idea of what 'essential object' means. Is a brick an essential object? [...] Then the answers came out. One man stood up and said, ""A brick as an individual, specific brick. THAT is what Whitehead means by an essential object."" Another man said ""No, it isn't the individual brick that is an essential object; it's the general character that all bricks have in common - their 'brickness' - that is the essential object."" Another guy got up and said, ""No, it's not in the bricks themselves. 'Essential object' means the idea in the mind that you get when you think of bricks."" Another guy got up, and another, and I tell you I have never heard such ingenious different ways of looking at a brick before.[image error]Now, did I mention the book gets hilarious at moments? :D Feynman was in Kyoto, trying to learn Japanese. So his lesson go like: One day he was teaching me the word for ""see."" ""All right,"" he said, ""You want to say, 'May I see your garden?' What do you say?"" I made up a sentence with the word that I just learned. ""No, no!"" he said. ""When you say to someone, ""Would you like to see my garden? you use the first 'see.' But when you want to see someone else's garden, you must use another 'see,' which is more polite."" ""Would you like to glance at my lousy garden?"" is essentially what you're saying in the first case, but when you want to look at the other fella's garden, you have to say something like, ""May I observe your gorgeous garden?"" So there's two different words you have to use.  Then he gave me another one: ""You go to a temple, and you want to look at the gardens..."" I made up a sentence, this time with the polite ""see."" ""No, no!"" he said. ""In the temple, the gardens are much more elegant. So you have to say something that would be equivalent to 'May I hang my eyes on your most exquisite gardens?'""*sigh* :'DI won't go into discussion of Feynman as a person outside of the science world. All I can conclude is that intelligence and morale do not have to coincide. Instead, I'll just troll the science a bit below :D brace yourself!"
27,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"This was a compilation of stories that Feynman tells from his own point of view. They were great. He seemed like a great guy. He was so full of life & had such an interest in it. From learning to pick locks, learn a different language, art, or music, he threw himself into the endeavor & did pretty well at it. I can appreciate that. He spent more time on these than he did on his work which is well documented elsewhere. I have Quantum Man: Richard Feynman's Life in Science in my queue, but I don't know when I'll get to it.He rarely had a bad word about anyone even when he was obviously disappointed in their choices. He sounds like a great teacher. He taught himself much (trig!) & I really liked the way he thought through problems, by building it in his head. I try to do that, but thought I was weird. I'll try harder from now on since I know I'm not. Many of the life lessons he passes along I've learned myself already, but they were still good ones.I'd heard he wasn't all that pleased with his Nobel Prize, but it was interesting to hear it from him. Considering what else he had said about his life to that point, it made a lot of sense.The bits on education were wonderful to listen to. I'd really liked to have had him as a teacher. I wish I could say I was shocked at the deplorable state of educational books that are being used on our children, but I was subject to them & so were my kids, so I know first hand. I can't say that the stupidity of the selection process surprised me either. The last section on how science should be performed & the standards it should be held to were great. It's especially important today when there is so much more to know, our technology has advanced so far, & is based on older methods. Several times lately, I've read articles that have stated facts that didn't add up to me. I've checked the studies they cited & found that they were 50 years old! No one has repeated the study in all that time?Great read & highly recommended."

In this autobiography, Feynman goes over his adventures growing up in NYC, at MIT, Princeton, Cornell, Caltech and other locales.

The book doesn't go much into his physics but his experiences as a prankster and tinkerer and safecracker and adventurer as he goes from one episode to another. Interesting guy."
29,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33262643-titas-i-read-in-bed,5,"Physics is like sex!Today we will talk about a scientist who was an extraordinary man, known as a teacher, lover, master safe cracker (who stole papers of Manhattan Project), fan of Las Vegas’s strip clubs, exceptional liar, musician, artist and probably the most brilliant, influential, and iconoclastic figure in his field in the post-World War II era.How does one define a role model? A prodigy, hard-worker, achiever, winner in the field one is interested in, right? Well in that case the Nobel Prize winner theoretical Physicist Richard P. Feynman is a perfect candidate as role model to physicists. He was dangerously smart and an exceptional teacher. But underneath everything we generally know about him as a scientist, he had a curios and alarmingly mischievous mind that knew no boundaries.First let me just mention some of his works:During World War II Feynman was recruited to serve as a staff member of the U.S. atomic bomb project at Princeton University (1941-42). He was co-awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work. Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology.Enough with the facts already! Now lets talk about the wisdom he left behind!While stealing papers of Nuclear bombing, you should leave mysterious clues: Feynman was a master of desk wiping, lock picking and safe cracking. He even used to think about the mentality and psychology of the safe owner to crack faster. He once cracked three safes of Manhattan project and left certain clues as a mysterious mastermind. Why? Oh just for the fun of course!If you have to lie, lie with full confidence: It doesn’t matter if what you are saying is absolute truth or not. Even if you are unsure, don’t show it. Just go through it in full throttle judging the situation. Example- Feynman once got on stage and recited a jibrish with just the few words he knew in a foreign language. When one doubtfully asked if it was wrong, he replied that the man didn’t understand the depth of the recital!If you’re in Vegas and short in money, act as drunk friends of the strippers: I don’t even have the courage and experience to explain this one.Love what you do and do what you love: In his own words- “Physics is like sex: sure it may give some practical result, but that’s not why we do it.”Know yourself, find where you belong and embrace your faults: “I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.”“That’s the trouble with not being in your own field: You don’t take it seriously.”“All the time you’re saying to yourself, ‘I could do that, but I won’t,’–which is just another way of saying that you can’t.”And most important of all- don’t lie to yourself: “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”Even after being a dashing lover and romantic husband, Feynman was a phenomenal teacher (yes, this man was everything one wishes to be). His series of books 
The Feynman Lectures on Physics
 is perhaps the most popular physics book ever written which Nature described the book as having “simplicity, beauty, unity … presented with enthusiasm and insight”.Although he had experimented with LSD and Marijuana just because he was curious about the effects, he was was a damn fine fellow when it came to the meaning and purpose of life. To him the purpose was knowledge as he had described, “I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there.”A boy who knew how radios work, a student who invented his own mathematical symbols for better understanding, an undergraduate who stole a door, the only scientist who watched Atom Bomb test (Trinity test) without wearing glasses, and the only scientist ever who had asked a reporter if he can refuse the Nobel Prize because he didn’t like to answer too many phone calls – Mr. Feynman had lived a life that we live in 4 or 5 lives summed up together. Why? For the glory of knowledge of course! He was an unique personality beyond rules and paths.Thus like many many other students of physics, if I’m asked about my role model, it is none other than R. P. Feynman- a man who understood very very early that one should focus on understanding instead of just knowing things. Reading about all his life and life’s works one wonders what an honour it would have been to see him once face to face. The man who must have been the only one to appear in the world of Physics with such energy and brilliance.Read this semi-autobiographic book to experience something like never before.In his precious word, a person should live a life 
“where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.”

30,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162027-emily,2,"This book of anecdotes is written in a very casual, fun way that makes it easy to read. The problem is that the author, Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Dick Feynman, is annoying. All the anecdotes involve him discovering a hidden talent, using it, delighting others (or himself if that's his real goal) and then being applauded for it (sometimes only by himself). For example, he discovers that he's a great artist, musician, safecracker, and critic. Everything revolves around him showing off and being somewhat of a jerk. There were many times when I thought, yeah buddy, *you* think it's funny but no one else does. A few stories like this and it's quirky but piled on top of each other, it's annoying.I can't really recommend this book. Maybe mischevious self-aggrandizing guys would enjoy it but otherwise, I suggest a pass."
31,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,5,"This book was a pure delight. The subtitle ""Adventures of a Curious Character"" is spot-on. Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life, thought a series of stories.One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things. You would think a world-famous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics - but Feynman was curious about everything he saw. He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show, he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them, he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling, he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women, he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun - the list goes on! My take: you should have your passions - but you should also have your hobbies. I think I need a new hobby :)I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system. He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to. I think this is not a unique problem in education.Another lesson learned from Feynman's studies of science is to never take any data for granted. Always always question the sources. Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would re-generate many of the numbers on his own - even if they had been published in other places. For many things we are (and not just in science) standing on the shoulders of giants. The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with. I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist, with real integrity. And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles. This book was a light-hearted attempt to point that out - not to mention, a very entertaining read."

He was a man ahead of his time when it came to many things -- & of his time when it came to his ideas about 'pretty girls' (as he calls women). The audiobook reader did a great job, but what a shame Feynman didn't read it himself before he passed on..."

“Would you like cream or lemon in your tea, Mr. Feynman?” It’s Mrs. Eisenhart, pouring tea.“I’ll have both, thank you,” I say, still looking for where I’m going to sit, when suddenly I hear “Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Surely you’re joking, Mr. Feynman.”
The title of this collection comes from a tale that took place early in Feynman's career where he was invited for an afternoon tea with the dean of his university. The dean's wife is serving and asks him the above question. Richard never drinks tea and never moves in the same society that does, little own the society that has lemon OR cream with it. A big theme of these stories and indeed a running theme in Feynman's life is that he had no time for formalisms, rituals or societal views. He does attribute a lot of this to his upbringing. His father was a uniform maker and often dealt with clients of all types of notoriety and he knew that underneath all those uniforms were just another naked ape. He passed on his views to his children and Richard went so far as to nearly not accept his Nobel Prize. To him it was another form of bullshit and that his reward had already been awarded with other scientists using his findings.It's no argument that Feynman was a brilliant physicist, but he also had many interests. And a great proportion of these stories are about these interests or how his interests intersected with his physics work. There is only one story in this collection that is technical in any way. The collection reads as if you had somehow run into Feynman in a seedy bar in 1960s Vegas (there's a story about this time) waiting for a showgirl to finish work. He is a great orator and the origins of these stories are that they were recorded and transcribed by Ralph Leighton, a drumming pal of Richard's. Yes, Feynman played the bongos. So while you have this brilliant man, in some ways ahead of his time in the ways that he thought and how he acted, there ares some hints that he is a man of his time. Reading these stories you come to realise that Feynman was quite the womaniser. He appreciated the female form in a socially acceptable way for the time that he lived in. And so when someone from the twenty-first century reads this book he can come across as a bit sleazy. I am not going to defend his attitudes nor am I going to condone them. Personally I found nothing overtly offensive about his actions or his attitudes. But I can imagine my partner reading this and sighing at several statements made by him. The book covers times in his childhood right up until late in life. There is a nice large chapter on his time at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project. There are also stories about his time in Brazil and Japan and his love for immersing himself in a different way of life. There are also a couple of great chapters on education; one about the standard of students he sees while in Brazil and the other concerning a time when he was asked to be on a panel to decide high school texts for his school region. I'd recommend this read to most people. It is extremely accessible, with little jargon or technical physics. It talks more on his philosophy of living, learning and how to deal with the world around you. He is definitely a great orator and that is why his legacy lives on. This book remains a popular seller in the general sciences and recordings of his lectures and interviews are popular on youtube. It's great to know that we still have so much of him around.And for those who want more there are plenty more collections of his wisdom. There is also Feynman a biographic graphic novel."

I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.” ― Richard Feynman, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!I've been circling this book, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, and Gleck's Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman for awhile. This one seemed the most fun and easiest place to start. I was driving from Taos/Santa Fe back to Phoenix last week and as I drove past Los Alamos, it was just the particle collision in my brain I needed to start on Feynman.Often, memoirs are hard to read because you know a bunch of it is façade. A person is showing you a part of them for a purpose. They want to be viewed as smart, important, funny, etc. They carefully guide you through a Potemkin village of their life. Richard Feynman's memoir is different. Not that I don't think Feynman had an ego. He might have even had an agenda with the book. But, for the most part, he seemed much more interested in the stories he wanted to tell, rather than on how they would make him look. He wasn't all that worried about how he looked so much. His entire life was built around doing what he wanted, exploring what he found interesting, violating taboos, beating his own drums and cutting his own path. He was a Nobel-prize winning polymath physicist whose other talents included playing drums, teaching, drawing naked girls, picking locks, making atomic bombs, practical jokes, and telling stories. He wasn't interested in the usual trappings of success. Many of those things annoyed him. He was curious. He was a risk-taker. He was a genius."

When I read this book, I almost feel that Feynman's telling the stories himself. Well, when that happens in real life, you always want to join in; here's my personal best effort at a Feynman-type anecdote. I hope it's now far enough in the past that the people concerned will see the funny side, if they happen to stumble across this page by accident!STAR TREK AND THE PERSONAL SATELLITE ASSISTANTIt was early 2000, and I had just started working at NASA Ames Research Center in California. I was part of this little group that was supposed to be developing spoken language dialogue systems for space applications. The guy whose idea it was had started up the group, recruited me and two other people, and then left to join Microsoft Research before I'd even arrived. So everyone was looking at us suspiciously. Why did NASA need software that you could talk to?The rest of this review is available elsewhere (the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons)"

Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.""(Video Review) The story of Feynman changed fundamentally, what I think about the world around me.The story of Richard and his father helped me to understand, that many parents could help their children to a more fulfilling life. Parents could pique the interest of the child very early and could give him real answers if he asks why again and again.He changed my view about scientists. He proved that the life of a scientist can be also “sexy” and interesting and the same time useful and deep activity. You rarely have a chance to meet pedagogues who can help you fall in love with learning and set the fire of science in you, as Feynman did.This book is not only interesting for physicists and scientists, but also for parents and pedagogues who want to inspire their children, students to have a better life. Elon Musk (founder of Tesla) founded a school build on the same principles what Feynman confessed. Where children have a chance to understand the thing work around us, understand the “whys”, and continuously maintain the interest of the students.Of course many people cannot afford this luxury. But also they can profit from these pedagogical principles, even if these seems to be terrifying at the first time as a parent. If you encourage your child to question anybody, you will be also questioned. If you encourage your child, not to defer to different orders, it questions basic societal values of many people and they can be stigmatized being unrespectful. But I think, you will only show a path for your child, which even can lead to the Nobel-prize, but to a happier, more interesting life. And now I am surely not joking."

I'll never make that mistake again, reading the experts' opinions. Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that's the end of you.
I can usually tell when I’m going to give a book 5 stars by one sign: I can’t shut up about it. Well, I couldn’t and can’t shut up about this book; it was simply great. This greatness sort of snuck up on me. I’d recently read a collection of anecdotes by a scientist (A Primate’s Memoir) and found it rather disappointing. Plus, the whole idea of reading a book of stories about a great physicist, without learning any actual physics, seemed silly. But my skepticism had withered away by the end of the first chapter; I was entranced by the man, absolutely fascinated, and remained so the whole time.The subtitle of this book is perfect, because the two meanings of the word “curious” converge to encapsulate Feynman: he was curious in the sense of being odd, as well as curious in his love of learning. I was trying to figure out a way to describe Feynman’s personality, and this is the best I’ve come up with: Feynman is Huck Finn grown up to become a physicist. The qualities that make Mark Twain’s most famous character so endearing are also the qualities that endear Feynman to me: mischievousness, curiosity, cleverness, honesty, naiveté, friendliness, frankness, and an uncompromising moral principle. Like Huck, Feynman is always getting himself into absurd situations, and getting out of them with pure quickness of mind; like Huck, Feynman likes to fool other people and play tricks, but all without a hint of malice; and like Huck, Feynman will stick his neck out for what he feels is right.There are some hilarious stories in here, which I won’t spoil. But what was more impressive to me was the amount of serious thought that could be found. Feynman’s criticism of the Brazilian school system—which relied overmuch on memorization by rote, and concentrated overmuch on passing tests, instead of teaching students how to make sense of the world around them—applies equally well to many aspects of the current U.S. school system. Equally relevant was Feynman’s chapter on the time he served on the board that oversaw the evaluation of math textbooks for the California school system; it was a Kafkaesque farce. But by far the most consistent intellectual theme that went through these reflections was an absolute distrust of pretension, reputation, convention, snobbery, prestige, and authority.In my own life, one of the most interesting, and also most difficult, lessons that I’ve had to learn is that people are not nearly as competent as they’d like you to believe. When I was a kid, I had a lot of faith in all sorts of things. I thought that if an ‘expert’ said something, it must be true; I assumed that there was a particular ‘expert’ in every type of activity, be it business or science, to ensure that things ran the way they were supposed to. In short, I had the comforting illusion that very smart people in very white lab coats were behind the scenes, ensuring that things ran smoothly. The world certainly cooperated with this illusion for a while (after all, that’s the whole basis of advertising); but it wasn’t long after meeting people in the ‘real world’ that this illusion imploded: the world is run by people underqualified and overconfident.I include this bit about myself because I don’t think I would have reacted so emotionally to this rather lighthearted book were it not that I had that experience. In a way, a distrust of all authority is Feynman’s central social message. He is constantly running into ‘experts’ who haven’t the slightest idea what they’re talking about. He goes to academic conferences full of pretentious windbags; he trusts the results of other people’s experiments, and later finds that they were seriously flawed.So any time somebody makes a claim, he decides to test it out for himself; and the few times he doesn’t do this, he gets into trouble. This realization, that most people are inclined to trust claims from authority, is integral to his almost supernatural ability to navigate unfamiliar situations; Feynman is so easily able to bluff his way through because people take his word for things. So this central insight—to always check for youself—is both the heart of his scientific attitude, as well as his way of effortlessly gliding through the world. His ability to crack safes, for example, wasn’t due to his knowing a lot about safes, but simply realizing that most people used their safes foolishly, not resetting the factory combination or setting it to something obvious. Most of us assume that we couldn’t figure out how to crack a safe; but Feynman did what he always did, and saw for himself whether he could: and he could!I honestly wish that this book was three times its length. Now, I must know more about Feynman. My favorite saints are the ones who would hate to be worshiped, and Feynman certainly would think this glowing review was nonsense. Well, perhaps it is; but the only way you’ll know for sure is by reading this book, and checking for yourself."
38,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,5,"Fellers, lemme tell you about one of the smartest sumbitches to ever walk the earth by way of narrative aid. Picture this:  You’ve covered yourself from head to tippy-toe in Vaseline, you’ve been grappling with the concept of higher dimensions all damn night. Engaging in repeated bouts of what could only be described as a physical profanity spawned from the unholy body-karate of Turkish Oil Wrestling, Passive Aggressive Pole Dancing, and Non-Euclidean Interpretive Dance, has sapped you of vital cognitive nutrients. You’re demoralized. There’s no way you’ll understand this. You’re so dumb you couldn’t pour piss out of a boot if the instructions were written on the heel. You might as well give up. Belching forth a line of caustic invectives, you rail against the deities of genetic inheritance, ideal geographic/home conditions, nurturing parents, free access to information, money, wonderful teachers, proper nutrition, interesting peer groups, and lead paint. Then you collapse. During the course of your angry nap, you experience a fitful dream. You’re in the midst of a grueling marathon. Your muscles are bathed in acid. Your lungs are a frozen ball of expanding gas crowding out your innards. With tremendous effort, and cussing so foul memory doesn’t permit you to recall it, you crest a hill. Off in the distance, you see the smartest people you know in your personal life, implacably approaching the finish. You realize that, with enough training, you could bridge the cognitive divide between you and them. “If I just buckle down and learn my multiplication tables, I can run shoulder to shoulder with Sara and Jimbo.” You think. They’re not so different from you, they just didn’t spend six months re-watching The Jersey Shore. This thought lightens all your burdens. You push on with renewed spirits. Nothing can stop you now.  Well, don’t get carried away chief, because you stagger across the finish line like a spastic newborn giraffe doing the Butterfly and proceed to void your bowels, which is just damn embarrassing. But you made it. By Jove you made it! At that moment, a man comes trotting by your fetal form. His steps are springy and there’s a curious clinking noise that accompanies his gait. He’s got a mischievous grin and intelligent eyes. He doesn’t appear to be sweating and his breathing is relaxed. How curious, you think. Well, at least you beat one person in this godawful pummeling of pavement. “Tough break, my man.” You offer your condolences to the stranger as he sails past you with a good natured laugh. “That’s Richard Feynman.” Someone says. “Poor bastard.” You cough. “That’s his tenth lap. He just does this shit for fun.” As the peculiar man recedes into the periphery, you catch a glint of metal. Beneath his shorts you see what appear to be cybernetic ostrich legs.Well, shit, that wasn’t as uplifting as I intended it to be. My point is: There’s smart people that you can imagine emulating through linear improvements, and then there are people like Richard Feynman, who are a different kind of athlete (and arguably a damned cheater). If you read this book you’ll come to know a bit about an affable rascal, a maverick, a first principles thinker with a wicked sense of humor who was insatiably curious about the natural world. A person who wasn’t comfortable with understanding anything superficially, or expressing it in a nauseatingly ostentatious way. He had a low tolerance for horseshit, saying a lot that means very little, (forgive me, Dick), sloppy reasoning, people pretending to know things they can’t possibly know, and making things more complicated than they need to be. Here is a brief (far from exhaustive) list of things he applied his alien intellect to:Quantum Electrodynamics.Statistical Mechanics.Parallel ComputingRadio construction and repair.Playing bongo drums.Superfluidity.Criticizing the educational system’s emphasis on rote memorization.Quarks.Painting.Participating in humanity’s potential swan song at Los Alamos.Safe cracking.Taking a cudgel to uppity philosophers.Teaching.Sussing out bureaucratic and engineering malfeasance in the wake of The Challenger Disaster.Coercing ants to follow pheromone trails.Cultivating an eccentric personality which makes for an interesting portfolio of anecdotes which comprise the bulk of this book.Threatening to piss through a man in a bar bathroom.Metabolizing oxygen.Offering the best quote of all time on his death bed. “I’d hate to die twice. It’s so boring.”Feynman is a personal hero of mine, and this is one of the greatest autobiographies ever written. It is genuinely funny, and if you come away from it without wanting to know more about how things really work, well, you’re dead to me. Let’s go out with a quote, because I’ve exhausted my word-bag.“It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn’t get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.”Despair of your position on the continuum of human intellect with this book!"
39,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/300186-penny,5,"Feynman is a physicist who taught at Cornell and Princeton, worked on the Manhattan Project and won the Nobel Prize. He's also a complete hoot. The book is a series of autobiographical stories -- pranks pulled as a student at MIT and at Los Alamos, teaching himself to paint, scientific discoveries he made, his three marriages, how he was rejected by the draft board for being mentally suspect (they asked him if he ever heard voices and he said yes he did and then went on to describe what he found interesting about that. He said that sometimes when falling in and out of sleep he'd imagine conversations with his foreign-born colleagues and the voices in his head spoke accurately with their accents -- but that if he tried to imitate such accents he could not do so at all. So how was it that one part of his brain had captured accents correctly but another hadn't? This was entirely typical of Feynman's wide ranging curiosity and intelligence, but the end result in this case was that the psychologists decided he was nuts. His colleagues at Cornell were vastly amused by this.)What I love about Feynman -- first of all, his great interest in everything and his willingness to experiment. The great joy he found in working things through (he said that the reason he'd never tried drugs, though he was tempted, was that he enjoyed thinking too much and didn't want to risk that.) Also, he's clearly so very intelligent and reading his book, his thoughts seem so easy to follow -- it makes the world of science seem accessible."
40,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,3,"There’s presumably a rule where only smart people are awarded Nobel Prizes in Physics. Richard Feynman was no exception. This memoir is filled with anecdotes from his childhood spent fixing radios, his experiences as a young man doing bomb research at Los Alamos up through his days as a renowned professor at Cal Tech. The central theme was always that this is one smart cookie. It was interesting to pick up on his thought processes. It probably didn’t feature as much pure science as most of his other books, but at least you could appreciate his intuition into the physical world’s biggest puzzles. Rather than emphasizing the technical details of physics, most of his stories were focused on his other interests and his geeky humor.While some of the stories were entertaining, and the lumens of candle power abounded, it didn’t always work for me. I kept getting the feeling that had the same stories been told in the third person, they would have been better – less egotistical sounding. In every one of his sidelines, he was masterful. It was like he was still driving home the point of how brilliant he was even when he was slumming it. After a while, I got tired of hearing how he became fluent in Portuguese when he taught in Brazil, or impressed the locals to no end with his distinctive style of bongo playing, or could dance like a professional, or got just about any woman he wanted to sleep with him. It was this last one that left the worst taste in my mouth. Some of his tales of attraction and conquest occurred when one of his wives was on her death bed. He was probably not as bad as I’ve made him sound. Like I said, we can certainly appreciate his intellect. He had a rare ability to explain difficult concepts in laymen’s terms, too. I got a confirmation of this a week after I finished the book when we were interviewing a former student of his from Cal Tech. He mentioned the “Feynman Effect”: a phenomenon whereby someone asking him a question got answered in such a clear and intuitive way that it was only later that they realized they still didn’t know exactly how it all tied to their existing understanding.So, count me as a fan of his scientific contributions and his ability to communicate, but not of his swagger. If it had all been a bit of a joke (you know, physicist … funny hair … limited social skills … but a would-be Lothario in spite of it), I would have laughed along with him, but I don’t think that was his intention. "
41,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/995651-nick,1,"One of the problems with reading a book written by a genius is that you have to ask yourself whether any perceived deficiencies in the text are due to the author, or due to your own failure to comprehend his brilliance. That said, I wasn't thrilled by this book. On a purely technical level, it would have benefited from a stronger editor. While there's a rough chronological order to the material, there tends to be a lot of jumping around both within and between the chapters. A few times, Feynman would relate some post-WWII anecdote, only to jump back to something that happened during his time at Los Alamos in the early 1940s. He'll mention that he divorced his second wife, and then shortly thereafter tell a story set during the marriage. It gives the book a very disjointed quality.On a more personal level, Feynman just doesn't strike me as someone you'd want to spend time with. About 30% of his stories talk about a time he pulled a fast one on somebody, or how he did something arrogant and obnoxious and it developed into an incident. Reading this book feels like babysitting a very rambunctious toddler--as amusing as his antics may be, you're can't help but looking forward to it being over. And while it's perhaps unfair to judge his behavior by modern standards, some of the womanizing and borderline misogyny (as when he decides that the best way to pick up women in bars is to treat them badly and call them whores) is a bit disappointing. Feynman's scientific accomplishments may be beyond reproach, but I doubt I'll spend any more time with his memoirs."
42,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9974807-tess-j,1,"Listen, I read this a long time ago but here's the thing about it. I'm a big sience fan, and I've always heard how brilliant and funny Richard Feynman was, especially because of his connection to the UofC. But I loathed this book. I suppose it's a memoir, and I don't know if it's ghost written or not, but what was supposed to endear me to Mr Feynman made him revolting to me. According to this book, he treated other people like dirt and thought it was hilarious, he correlated pure intelligence with worth, and he dismissed and disrespected everyone who he felt was not as intellectual as he was (and being that he was a genius, that was most of everybody). Perhaps this is melodramatic, but he sickened me a touch. His blatant disrespect for the work of other scholars in the guise of a patronizing outlook is wholly demoralizing, and for people who wished to pursue a degree in the sciences under him I can't even imagine what it was like to deal with his pomp and ego. I know that the persona displayed in memoirs is different than the actual personality of a person, but the gleeful manner in which he presents his attitude does nothing to disprove my issues with his style.

They’re really not “crazy adventures,” these anecdotes; my own father's are easily just as rich and bizarre. Feynman came off to me as a somewhat unpleasant character: he was full to the brim of himself; his false modesty (“I’m too dim to realize when to keep my mouth shut, I just say what I think”) was cloying and annoying, as were his amazement at anyone else’s talent (a professional drummer is far better than him at the drums; this “shocks” him), his claims to understand nature better than artists, and his thinly-veiled put-downs of anyone even remotely concerned with the abstract. He was just the kind of jerk who, caught up in his criticism of others’ inability to grasp his broad points, never begins to wonder whether he is the one missing the gist. Also, his anecdotes are not fleshed out with context: who exactly are the people he’s talking to? When was this? I don’t care. In all, funny and interesting at times (at Los Alamos, on a committee to select school text books), but mainly kind of mundane."
44,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80479-peter-frazier,5,"This amusing little book of anecdotes had an alarmingly influential role in my life. It convinced me of the odd notion that it would be a good idea to go to Caltech and major in physics. In retrospect, this would have been a better idea had I been born around 1930 and was starting my scientific career around 1940, but nowadays it's a tough slog in physics, both money-wise and also discovery-wise. I think that people like Bohr and Planck and Einstein and Feynman discovered all the good stuff in physics and that future theory will be more difficult and less beautiful (though perhaps these string-theorists put my foot in my mouth). I wish I had realized all this when I was 17 rather than 24, but all is not lost: physics is wonderful training for all manner of mathematical disciplines, and all has worked out for the best. I retain a deep fondness for this book, and rereading old passages brings me comfort. If you ever have the choice between reading this book and doing something productive and worthwhile, I recommend that you read this book. All will work out for the best for you too."
45,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder,4,"Laugh out loud funny. My dad read this outloud to us when we were kids - I'm guessing at the exact year - and the whole family literally cried with laughter many times during the performance. Feyman's other memoirs are good too, but this is the funniest. I still think of it often. For instance, every time I use a combination lock, I think of his safe-cracking phase, and how it's every child's dream to learn how to crack safes and get at all that secret and valuable stuff. Which really sums up this book - Mr. Feyman approached life with the curiosity and glee of a small boy. He never lost that childlike sense of wonder or mischief.My only caveat - Mr. Feyman was quite the ladies' man, and there is a certain old-school misogyny in his style of writing about women. Looked at in the most charitable light possible, it's a reminder that he was human, as well as a genius physicist, and frankly, not always right. It doesn't make him any less of an amazing physicist, but it does remind us that he was mortal too.And after reading all of his memoirs, I began to suspect that his cavalier attitude towards women arose at least in part from his grief at the loss of his first wife, who died of cancer at a very young age (her early 20s, if I remember correctly), while he was busy working on the nuclear bomb in Los Alamos. She is the only woman he writes tenderly about - after that, the talk shifts to conquests and getting girls naked. His descriptions of his subsequent marriages lack the warmth of that first marriage, even if there is more fodder for humor. Something about it rings hollow even in Feyman's warm, humorous, self-deprecating voice. There is a real tragedy written between the lines here."
46,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2467151-elizabeth-k,2,"This was disappointing, because I've been wanting to read this for a while because he is so renown for being quite the hilarious character as well as a Nobel prize-winning physicist. This is a collection of essays that serves as a memoir; many are not directly related to physics, but that's definitely the theme. After reading this, my conclusion is that Feynman was mostly a world class knob. He lost me fairly early into it, when he described how you could see physics in action in the everyday world by messing with a waitress's tips. How very droll of you, Mr. Feynman. He is certainly quite the character in the same sense your annoying neighbor is quite the character, the kind who sees you unloading your groceries from the car and saunters over to give you pointless advice about his expert analysis on the best way to unload groceries without helping you, driving you to grit your teeth and nod as you flee toward your door because anything you might say in response, such as ""shut UP, annoying guy!"" would result in him saying ""Aw shucks, I can't help it that I'm smarter than you."" Many demerits for egregious overuse of the exclamation point.Grade: C-Recommended: Not really, although the essays set during his time at Los Alamos are somewhat interesting given the historical context. I suppose it's possible he really was charming and amusing in real life, but you wouldn't know it from his writing."

To follow your dreams, make them happen, make a living out of them, ultimately all this work to be of help for others and above all to enjoy life as you wish to - this is what I call to live your life to the fullest! Mr. Feynman stories are simply wonderful! They are not just funny - they present a man which desire to learn was his motto in life (he owes this desire to his father, a very remarkable man). According to him, anything can be learned as long as you wish for - so very true. If all pupils and students would have teachers like him, the world would be a much better place... I think the saying ""like father, like son"" emerged from their relationship. ;)Some called him corky; others arrogant - and maybe he was. But who are we to judge? I don't think it was easy for him to work on the atomic bomb project - the pressure, the implications... even brilliant minds need a getaway of some form. Maybe when we'll do the things he did we'll get to have a word on this matter. Until then, lets just admire his passion, his dedication and his work.The book does not contain scientific language, calculations or anything alike. Even if you're not interested in physics, this book is more than worth reading. Such a life experience not many can say they had...One more thing: I came across on below interview, produced by BBC in 1981, called The Pleasure Of Finding Things Out. 50 minutes length, worth every second of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgaw9... . It is a shorter version of his memoirs presented in the book and the following fragment is a part of it: People say to me, “Are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?” No I am not. I am just looking to find out more about the world. And if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law that explains everything so be it. That would be very nice discovery. If it turns out it’s like an onion with millions of layers and we just sick and tired of looking at the layers then that’s the way it is! But whatever way it comes out it’s nature, it’s there, and she’s going to come out the way she is.If you decide to put it on your to-read list, I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did :)"

He has been a hero of mine since I was very young, probably because my father also greatly admires him and spoke to me about Feynman and his unique personality from time to time.There are some great stories in this book and they will make you laugh out loud. Feynman was always so full of life and he was curious about absolutely everything from a very early age. He would always want to know, ""How does that work?"" or ""Why is that the way it is?"" or ""Is there another way to do that?"" He would also latch onto something and decide that he wanted to do it, and to do it really well. For example, witnessing the bongo-playing in Brazil inspired him to learn to play like that and not like some studio-taught purist. He achieved it through dedication to his objective and sheer passion.What made Feynman a genius? Well, there were lots of factors that contributed to his status, many of them discussed in other reviews of this book, but, my reason for putting him into that classification was that he was capable of explaining the most complex of matters to a five-year-old. That is TRUE genius.I have read this book many times. It is a short book and will remain amongst my collection until the day that I die. If you haven't read it already, you should.

This is a captivating story of an amazing life that could not have been better had it been scripted at birth.Mr. Feynman has done it all. I loved the feeling of tagging along on this brilliant, Nobel-prize winning physicist’s life. A little eccentric yes, but the narrative flows in a very conversational manner (which is a style I like very much). From his early life, to his work on the atomic bomb, to his ability to crack safes, I could not help but admire his chutzpah and proven success. This ""nerd"" even had tremendous success with the ladies. Therefore, on behalf of nerds everywhere, you are our hero!He, like Robert Todd Lincoln, was always lucky enough to be at the right place at the right time in history. The difference is that Feynman tended to be around for the more auspicious historical events. Truly, there are not enough adjectives to describe his amazing talents, admirable life, and impressive success.

People often mistakenly think that they’ve grasped something, but they’ve merely memorized facts rather than genuinely understood the thing conceptually. He also pointed out that with science, as with life in general, it is important to PLAY. We tend to lose sight of this far too often.As you’d expect, there is an abundance of humor in these anecdotes. My favorite funny part was when Feynman got into his first fight in a bar:
“One time I was in the men’s room of the bar and there was a guy at the urinal. He was kind of drunk, and said to me in a mean-sounding voice, ‘I don’t like your face. I think I’ll push it in.’I was scared green. I replied in an equally mean voice, ‘Get out of my way, or I’ll pee right through ya!’”
Best response ever."
52,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-romanas,5,"This is the manual of curiosity and intelligence by the great physicist -- Richard Feynman. An incredible life of one of the prodigious thinkers is summarized in less than 400 pages. I would not have put it down even if the book was 4000 pages long, so interesting is the story, a real page-turner.Apparently, by not taking life so seriously Dr. Feynman achieved some remarkably serious things which led to Nobel prize, and other remarkable accomplishments. How many other Nobel prize laureates have safe cracking as a hobby? The book is not just an entertaining story about an extraordinary life. The reader will find some invaluable wisdom about the essence of science, curiosity, creativity, teaching, science ethics, and life morals.I knew, believed, and always felt that curiosity is an essential ingredient of a purposeful life. Feynman, by his life, proved the point. For everybody seeking inspiration and curious about one of the most curious, and where it all might lead, this is a charming book which will probably be a jump-start to other Feynman’s books."

Henceforth, this name will evoke images of a prankster, a musician, a safe cracker, a biologist, a Brazilian band member, an artist who visited several brothels to sell his painting and a man who refused to grow old. These anecdotes from his life are sure to tickle your funny bone."

It’s obvious that they have a high functioning mind, which is the cause of such provocative mischievousness, and what follows next is what we already know, when they are constantly being told by their teachers! “You better use your mind to score good grades”.I think that’s the problem with our education system. It leaves no space for free thinking, it doesn’t let the students to think differently and to let them learn by experiments, by failed attempts, this is why most of us begin to lose interest in science because what we learn doesn’t really stay with us for a long time, since we don’t even understand the whys and hows behind the things!What makes a wind-up toy go? I thought, “I know what it is: They’re going to talk about mechanics, how the springs work inside the toy; about chemistry, how the engine of the automobile works; and biology, about how the muscles work.”If this makes you wonder why you never had a teacher who made you question everything and in turn made the process of learning interesting, then this book is for you! Professor Feynman (with his puzzle drive for discovering what’s the matter with things to figure out what to do to fix it) is the teacher you are looking for!This book is not an autobiography in its absolute sense, it’s rather a recollection of the adventures of a curious character which will give you a new world view to understand the genius behind a prankster and his indignant impatience with pretentious pompous fools and their hypocrisy.Its hilarious anecdotes (which are divided into wacky yet fascinating chapters) of fixing radio by thinking, stealing a door, learning biology with a map of a cat, fooling safecracker by safecracking, testing bloodhounds, not making decisions by refusing offers, receiving Nobel prize for the pleasure of discovering what he did, drawing and selling his beautiful artworks and learning to be an occasional jerk to women to get laid and playing with ants and bongo professionally, will surely hook you till the end.Like all smart people he might come across as a narcissist but if you have an admiration for geeky humour coupled with a razor-sharp wit and are curious enough to understand what sets his thought process apart from his brilliant peers, you might discover Feynman techniques to learn how to maintain an open but skeptical mind to look at things differently and your life will never be the same again!Following are the few things that I learned from this book, which I will never forget!You should have your passions – but also have some hobbies and strive to be extremely good at them by being really interested and keep on practising till you learn to do it fairly well, be attentive, use your own knowledge to try it differently from what is usually the practice. Learn from people around, don’t fear to experiment, gain new experiences, so that you have a story to tell, be notorious to exercise your brain but never hurt anyone. Be considerate and helpful! Learn how things work and to truly understand something, question why it is the way it is, what’s its use. Don’t memorize the definition of words and formulas but learn its application, learn with the help of examples and always make sure that the source of knowledge you are using is correct, always cross-check it by yourself. Learn what the rest of the world is like because the variety is always worthwhile."

Made me take interest in physics around us again. :)Feynman was surely a man of multiple lives, how could anybody live so much? Physicist, safe cracker, artist, frigideira (an instrument used in Samba music) player, nobel prize laureate, drummer, and more. His mischievous nature and varied interests (exploration of hypnotism and sense deprivation, e.g.) were inspiring in a way.As a scientist, he leaves out important messages primarily in the chapters: O Americano, Outra Vez! (later part, pg. 211 onwards, about state of science education in Brazil at the time); Is Electricity Fire? (on Jewish (dis)interest in science); Judging Books by their Covers (review of school math books, and disappointment obtained from them); and lastly, Cargo Cult Science, the last chapter.A must read for any science-loving person."
56,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10976459-irena,4,"This book's been recommended to me by my boyfriend and after giving it a 5-page trial, I got sucked right into it!I partially read it, partially listened to the audiobook (which was, imho, done really well and was so pleasant to listen to while doing puzzle or gaming or whatnot).I loved the very beginning, his childhood, where he was so curious and so sweet about his early discoveries. The rest of his science-related work as well as hobbies (drumming, painting, lock-picking, math duels, pranks, school book selection and more) can be preeety much summarized to..well, this picture:Feynman was definitely no bore. I love his way of everyday thinking: so practical, stripped of any tedious theorizing and philosophical blabber. Like in that part where he visits the biology department and find out that all the students memorize so many facts by heart when they could just look it up quickly. So I went to the librarian in the biology section and asked her if she could find me a map of the cat. ""A map of the cat, sir?"" she asked, horrified. ""You mean a zoological chart!"" From then on there were rumors about some dumb biology graduate student who was looking for a ""map of the cat.""  When it came time for me to give my talk on the subject, I started off by drawing an outline of the cat and began to name the various muscles. The other students in the class interrupt me: ""We know all that!"" ""Oh,"" I say, ""you do? Then no wonder I can catch up with you so fast after you had four years of biology."" They had wasted all their time memorizing stuff like that, when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes.""It's a really interesting, easy read - I really enjoyed this one, both in written and in audio form. And my most favourite part:  When I sat with the philosophers I listened to them discuss very seriously a book called Process and Reality by Whitehead. [...]First of all, I sat there without saying anything, which is almost unbelievable, but also true. A student gave a report on the chapter to be studied that week. In it Whitehead kept using the words ""essential object"" in a particular technical way that presumably he had defined, but that I didn't understand. After some discussion as to what ""essential object"" meant, the professor leading the seminar said something meant to clarify things and drew something that looked like lightning bolts on the blackboard. ""Mr. Feynman,"" he said, ""would you say an electron is an 'essential object'?"" Well, not I was in trouble. I admitted that I hadn't read the book, so I had no idea of what Whitehead meant by the phrase; I had only come to watch. ""But,"" I said, ""I'll try to answer the professor's question if you will first answer a question from me, so I can have a better idea of what 'essential object' means. Is a brick an essential object? [...] Then the answers came out. One man stood up and said, ""A brick as an individual, specific brick. THAT is what Whitehead means by an essential object."" Another man said ""No, it isn't the individual brick that is an essential object; it's the general character that all bricks have in common - their 'brickness' - that is the essential object."" Another guy got up and said, ""No, it's not in the bricks themselves. 'Essential object' means the idea in the mind that you get when you think of bricks."" Another guy got up, and another, and I tell you I have never heard such ingenious different ways of looking at a brick before.[image error]Now, did I mention the book gets hilarious at moments? :D Feynman was in Kyoto, trying to learn Japanese. So his lesson go like: One day he was teaching me the word for ""see."" ""All right,"" he said, ""You want to say, 'May I see your garden?' What do you say?"" I made up a sentence with the word that I just learned. ""No, no!"" he said. ""When you say to someone, ""Would you like to see my garden? you use the first 'see.' But when you want to see someone else's garden, you must use another 'see,' which is more polite."" ""Would you like to glance at my lousy garden?"" is essentially what you're saying in the first case, but when you want to look at the other fella's garden, you have to say something like, ""May I observe your gorgeous garden?"" So there's two different words you have to use.  Then he gave me another one: ""You go to a temple, and you want to look at the gardens..."" I made up a sentence, this time with the polite ""see."" ""No, no!"" he said. ""In the temple, the gardens are much more elegant. So you have to say something that would be equivalent to 'May I hang my eyes on your most exquisite gardens?'""*sigh* :'DI won't go into discussion of Feynman as a person outside of the science world. All I can conclude is that intelligence and morale do not have to coincide. Instead, I'll just troll the science a bit below :D brace yourself!"
57,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"This was a compilation of stories that Feynman tells from his own point of view. They were great. He seemed like a great guy. He was so full of life & had such an interest in it. From learning to pick locks, learn a different language, art, or music, he threw himself into the endeavor & did pretty well at it. I can appreciate that. He spent more time on these than he did on his work which is well documented elsewhere. I have Quantum Man: Richard Feynman's Life in Science in my queue, but I don't know when I'll get to it.He rarely had a bad word about anyone even when he was obviously disappointed in their choices. He sounds like a great teacher. He taught himself much (trig!) & I really liked the way he thought through problems, by building it in his head. I try to do that, but thought I was weird. I'll try harder from now on since I know I'm not. Many of the life lessons he passes along I've learned myself already, but they were still good ones.I'd heard he wasn't all that pleased with his Nobel Prize, but it was interesting to hear it from him. Considering what else he had said about his life to that point, it made a lot of sense.The bits on education were wonderful to listen to. I'd really liked to have had him as a teacher. I wish I could say I was shocked at the deplorable state of educational books that are being used on our children, but I was subject to them & so were my kids, so I know first hand. I can't say that the stupidity of the selection process surprised me either. The last section on how science should be performed & the standards it should be held to were great. It's especially important today when there is so much more to know, our technology has advanced so far, & is based on older methods. Several times lately, I've read articles that have stated facts that didn't add up to me. I've checked the studies they cited & found that they were 50 years old! No one has repeated the study in all that time?Great read & highly recommended."

In this autobiography, Feynman goes over his adventures growing up in NYC, at MIT, Princeton, Cornell, Caltech and other locales.

The book doesn't go much into his physics but his experiences as a prankster and tinkerer and safecracker and adventurer as he goes from one episode to another. Interesting guy."
59,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33262643-titas-i-read-in-bed,5,"Physics is like sex!Today we will talk about a scientist who was an extraordinary man, known as a teacher, lover, master safe cracker (who stole papers of Manhattan Project), fan of Las Vegas’s strip clubs, exceptional liar, musician, artist and probably the most brilliant, influential, and iconoclastic figure in his field in the post-World War II era.How does one define a role model? A prodigy, hard-worker, achiever, winner in the field one is interested in, right? Well in that case the Nobel Prize winner theoretical Physicist Richard P. Feynman is a perfect candidate as role model to physicists. He was dangerously smart and an exceptional teacher. But underneath everything we generally know about him as a scientist, he had a curios and alarmingly mischievous mind that knew no boundaries.First let me just mention some of his works:During World War II Feynman was recruited to serve as a staff member of the U.S. atomic bomb project at Princeton University (1941-42). He was co-awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work. Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology.Enough with the facts already! Now lets talk about the wisdom he left behind!While stealing papers of Nuclear bombing, you should leave mysterious clues: Feynman was a master of desk wiping, lock picking and safe cracking. He even used to think about the mentality and psychology of the safe owner to crack faster. He once cracked three safes of Manhattan project and left certain clues as a mysterious mastermind. Why? Oh just for the fun of course!If you have to lie, lie with full confidence: It doesn’t matter if what you are saying is absolute truth or not. Even if you are unsure, don’t show it. Just go through it in full throttle judging the situation. Example- Feynman once got on stage and recited a jibrish with just the few words he knew in a foreign language. When one doubtfully asked if it was wrong, he replied that the man didn’t understand the depth of the recital!If you’re in Vegas and short in money, act as drunk friends of the strippers: I don’t even have the courage and experience to explain this one.Love what you do and do what you love: In his own words- “Physics is like sex: sure it may give some practical result, but that’s not why we do it.”Know yourself, find where you belong and embrace your faults: “I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.”“That’s the trouble with not being in your own field: You don’t take it seriously.”“All the time you’re saying to yourself, ‘I could do that, but I won’t,’–which is just another way of saying that you can’t.”And most important of all- don’t lie to yourself: “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”Even after being a dashing lover and romantic husband, Feynman was a phenomenal teacher (yes, this man was everything one wishes to be). His series of books 
The Feynman Lectures on Physics
 is perhaps the most popular physics book ever written which Nature described the book as having “simplicity, beauty, unity … presented with enthusiasm and insight”.Although he had experimented with LSD and Marijuana just because he was curious about the effects, he was was a damn fine fellow when it came to the meaning and purpose of life. To him the purpose was knowledge as he had described, “I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there.”A boy who knew how radios work, a student who invented his own mathematical symbols for better understanding, an undergraduate who stole a door, the only scientist who watched Atom Bomb test (Trinity test) without wearing glasses, and the only scientist ever who had asked a reporter if he can refuse the Nobel Prize because he didn’t like to answer too many phone calls – Mr. Feynman had lived a life that we live in 4 or 5 lives summed up together. Why? For the glory of knowledge of course! He was an unique personality beyond rules and paths.Thus like many many other students of physics, if I’m asked about my role model, it is none other than R. P. Feynman- a man who understood very very early that one should focus on understanding instead of just knowing things. Reading about all his life and life’s works one wonders what an honour it would have been to see him once face to face. The man who must have been the only one to appear in the world of Physics with such energy and brilliance.Read this semi-autobiographic book to experience something like never before.In his precious word, a person should live a life 
“where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.”

60,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162027-emily,2,"This book of anecdotes is written in a very casual, fun way that makes it easy to read. The problem is that the author, Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Dick Feynman, is annoying. All the anecdotes involve him discovering a hidden talent, using it, delighting others (or himself if that's his real goal) and then being applauded for it (sometimes only by himself). For example, he discovers that he's a great artist, musician, safecracker, and critic. Everything revolves around him showing off and being somewhat of a jerk. There were many times when I thought, yeah buddy, *you* think it's funny but no one else does. A few stories like this and it's quirky but piled on top of each other, it's annoying.I can't really recommend this book. Maybe mischevious self-aggrandizing guys would enjoy it but otherwise, I suggest a pass."
61,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,5,"This book was a pure delight. The subtitle ""Adventures of a Curious Character"" is spot-on. Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life, thought a series of stories.One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things. You would think a world-famous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics - but Feynman was curious about everything he saw. He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show, he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them, he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling, he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women, he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun - the list goes on! My take: you should have your passions - but you should also have your hobbies. I think I need a new hobby :)I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system. He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to. I think this is not a unique problem in education.Another lesson learned from Feynman's studies of science is to never take any data for granted. Always always question the sources. Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would re-generate many of the numbers on his own - even if they had been published in other places. For many things we are (and not just in science) standing on the shoulders of giants. The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with. I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist, with real integrity. And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles. This book was a light-hearted attempt to point that out - not to mention, a very entertaining read."

He was a man ahead of his time when it came to many things -- & of his time when it came to his ideas about 'pretty girls' (as he calls women).

“Would you like cream or lemon in your tea, Mr. Feynman?” It’s Mrs. Eisenhart, pouring tea.“I’ll have both, thank you,” I say, still looking for where I’m going to sit, when suddenly I hear “Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Surely you’re joking, Mr. Feynman.”
The title of this collection comes from a tale that took place early in Feynman's career where he was invited for an afternoon tea with the dean of his university. The dean's wife is serving and asks him the above question. Richard never drinks tea and never moves in the same society that does, little own the society that has lemon OR cream with it. A big theme of these stories and indeed a running theme in Feynman's life is that he had no time for formalisms, rituals or societal views. He does attribute a lot of this to his upbringing. His father was a uniform maker and often dealt with clients of all types of notoriety and he knew that underneath all those uniforms were just another naked ape. He passed on his views to his children and Richard went so far as to nearly not accept his Nobel Prize. To him it was another form of bullshit and that his reward had already been awarded with other scientists using his findings.It's no argument that Feynman was a brilliant physicist, but he also had many interests. And a great proportion of these stories are about these interests or how his interests intersected with his physics work. There is only one story in this collection that is technical in any way. The collection reads as if you had somehow run into Feynman in a seedy bar in 1960s Vegas (there's a story about this time) waiting for a showgirl to finish work. He is a great orator and the origins of these stories are that they were recorded and transcribed by Ralph Leighton, a drumming pal of Richard's. Yes, Feynman played the bongos. So while you have this brilliant man, in some ways ahead of his time in the ways that he thought and how he acted, there ares some hints that he is a man of his time. Reading these stories you come to realise that Feynman was quite the womaniser. He appreciated the female form in a socially acceptable way for the time that he lived in. And so when someone from the twenty-first century reads this book he can come across as a bit sleazy. I am not going to defend his attitudes nor am I going to condone them. Personally I found nothing overtly offensive about his actions or his attitudes. But I can imagine my partner reading this and sighing at several statements made by him. The book covers times in his childhood right up until late in life. There is a nice large chapter on his time at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project. There are also stories about his time in Brazil and Japan and his love for immersing himself in a different way of life. There are also a couple of great chapters on education; one about the standard of students he sees while in Brazil and the other concerning a time when he was asked to be on a panel to decide high school texts for his school region. I'd recommend this read to most people. It is extremely accessible, with little jargon or technical physics. It talks more on his philosophy of living, learning and how to deal with the world around you. He is definitely a great orator and that is why his legacy lives on. This book remains a popular seller in the general sciences and recordings of his lectures and interviews are popular on youtube. It's great to know that we still have so much of him around.And for those who want more there are plenty more collections of his wisdom. There is also Feynman a biographic graphic novel."

I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.” ― Richard Feynman, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!I've been circling this book, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, and Gleck's Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman for awhile. This one seemed the most fun and easiest place to start. I was driving from Taos/Santa Fe back to Phoenix last week and as I drove past Los Alamos, it was just the particle collision in my brain I needed to start on Feynman.Often, memoirs are hard to read because you know a bunch of it is façade. A person is showing you a part of them for a purpose. They want to be viewed as smart, important, funny, etc. They carefully guide you through a Potemkin village of their life. Richard Feynman's memoir is different. Not that I don't think Feynman had an ego. He might have even had an agenda with the book. But, for the most part, he seemed much more interested in the stories he wanted to tell, rather than on how they would make him look. He wasn't all that worried about how he looked so much. His entire life was built around doing what he wanted, exploring what he found interesting, violating taboos, beating his own drums and cutting his own path. He was a Nobel-prize winning polymath physicist whose other talents included playing drums, teaching, drawing naked girls, picking locks, making atomic bombs, practical jokes, and telling stories. He wasn't interested in the usual trappings of success. Many of those things annoyed him. He was curious. He was a risk-taker. He was a genius."

When I read this book, I almost feel that Feynman's telling the stories himself. Well, when that happens in real life, you always want to join in; here's my personal best effort at a Feynman-type anecdote. I hope it's now far enough in the past that the people concerned will see the funny side, if they happen to stumble across this page by accident!STAR TREK AND THE PERSONAL SATELLITE ASSISTANTIt was early 2000, and I had just started working at NASA Ames Research Center in California. I was part of this little group that was supposed to be developing spoken language dialogue systems for space applications.

Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.""(Video Review) The story of Feynman changed fundamentally, what I think about the world around me.The story of Richard and his father helped me to understand, that many parents could help their children to a more fulfilling life. Parents could pique the interest of the child very early and could give him real answers if he asks why again and again.He changed my view about scientists. He proved that the life of a scientist can be also “sexy” and interesting and the same time useful and deep activity. You rarely have a chance to meet pedagogues who can help you fall in love with learning and set the fire of science in you, as Feynman did.This book is not only interesting for physicists and scientists, but also for parents and pedagogues who want to inspire their children, students to have a better life. Elon Musk (founder of Tesla) founded a school build on the same principles what Feynman confessed. Where children have a chance to understand the thing work around us, understand the “whys”, and continuously maintain the interest of the students.Of course many people cannot afford this luxury. But also they can profit from these pedagogical principles, even if these seems to be terrifying at the first time as a parent. If you encourage your child to question anybody, you will be also questioned. If you encourage your child, not to defer to different orders, it questions basic societal values of many people and they can be stigmatized being unrespectful. But I think, you will only show a path for your child, which even can lead to the Nobel-prize, but to a happier, more interesting life. And now I am surely not joking."

I'll never make that mistake again, reading the experts' opinions. Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that's the end of you.
I can usually tell when I’m going to give a book 5 stars by one sign: I can’t shut up about it. Well, I couldn’t and can’t shut up about this book; it was simply great. This greatness sort of snuck up on me. I’d recently read a collection of anecdotes by a scientist (A Primate’s Memoir) and found it rather disappointing. Plus, the whole idea of reading a book of stories about a great physicist, without learning any actual physics, seemed silly. But my skepticism had withered away by the end of the first chapter; I was entranced by the man, absolutely fascinated, and remained so the whole time.The subtitle of this book is perfect, because the two meanings of the word “curious” converge to encapsulate Feynman: he was curious in the sense of being odd, as well as curious in his love of learning. I was trying to figure out a way to describe Feynman’s personality, and this is the best I’ve come up with: Feynman is Huck Finn grown up to become a physicist. The qualities that make Mark Twain’s most famous character so endearing are also the qualities that endear Feynman to me: mischievousness, curiosity, cleverness, honesty, naiveté, friendliness, frankness, and an uncompromising moral principle. Like Huck, Feynman is always getting himself into absurd situations, and getting out of them with pure quickness of mind; like Huck, Feynman likes to fool other people and play tricks, but all without a hint of malice; and like Huck, Feynman will stick his neck out for what he feels is right.There are some hilarious stories in here, which I won’t spoil. But what was more impressive to me was the amount of serious thought that could be found. Feynman’s criticism of the Brazilian school system—which relied overmuch on memorization by rote, and concentrated overmuch on passing tests, instead of teaching students how to make sense of the world around them—applies equally well to many aspects of the current U.S. school system. Equally relevant was Feynman’s chapter on the time he served on the board that oversaw the evaluation of math textbooks for the California school system; it was a Kafkaesque farce. But by far the most consistent intellectual theme that went through these reflections was an absolute distrust of pretension, reputation, convention, snobbery, prestige, and authority.In my own life, one of the most interesting, and also most difficult, lessons that I’ve had to learn is that people are not nearly as competent as they’d like you to believe. When I was a kid, I had a lot of faith in all sorts of things. I thought that if an ‘expert’ said something, it must be true; I assumed that there was a particular ‘expert’ in every type of activity, be it business or science, to ensure that things ran the way they were supposed to. In short, I had the comforting illusion that very smart people in very white lab coats were behind the scenes, ensuring that things ran smoothly. The world certainly cooperated with this illusion for a while (after all, that’s the whole basis of advertising); but it wasn’t long after meeting people in the ‘real world’ that this illusion imploded: the world is run by people underqualified and overconfident.I include this bit about myself because I don’t think I would have reacted so emotionally to this rather lighthearted book were it not that I had that experience. In a way, a distrust of all authority is Feynman’s central social message. He is constantly running into ‘experts’ who haven’t the slightest idea what they’re talking about. He goes to academic conferences full of pretentious windbags; he trusts the results of other people’s experiments, and later finds that they were seriously flawed.So any time somebody makes a claim, he decides to test it out for himself; and the few times he doesn’t do this, he gets into trouble. This realization, that most people are inclined to trust claims from authority, is integral to his almost supernatural ability to navigate unfamiliar situations; Feynman is so easily able to bluff his way through because people take his word for things. So this central insight—to always check for youself—is both the heart of his scientific attitude, as well as his way of effortlessly gliding through the world. His ability to crack safes, for example, wasn’t due to his knowing a lot about safes, but simply realizing that most people used their safes foolishly, not resetting the factory combination or setting it to something obvious. Most of us assume that we couldn’t figure out how to crack a safe; but Feynman did what he always did, and saw for himself whether he could: and he could!I honestly wish that this book was three times its length. Now, I must know more about Feynman. My favorite saints are the ones who would hate to be worshiped, and Feynman certainly would think this glowing review was nonsense. Well, perhaps it is; but the only way you’ll know for sure is by reading this book, and checking for yourself."

Picture this:  You’ve covered yourself from head to tippy-toe in Vaseline, you’ve been grappling with the concept of higher dimensions all damn night. Engaging in repeated bouts of what could only be described as a physical profanity spawned from the unholy body-karate of Turkish Oil Wrestling, Passive Aggressive Pole Dancing, and Non-Euclidean Interpretive Dance, has sapped you of vital cognitive nutrients. You’re demoralized. There’s no way you’ll understand this. You’re so dumb you couldn’t pour piss out of a boot if the instructions were written on the heel. You might as well give up. Belching forth a line of caustic invectives, you rail against the deities of genetic inheritance, ideal geographic/home conditions, nurturing parents, free access to information, money, wonderful teachers, proper nutrition, interesting peer groups, and lead paint. Then you collapse. During the course of your angry nap, you experience a fitful dream. You’re in the midst of a grueling marathon. Your muscles are bathed in acid. Your lungs are a frozen ball of expanding gas crowding out your innards. With tremendous effort, and cussing so foul memory doesn’t permit you to recall it, you crest a hill. Off in the distance, you see the smartest people you know in your personal life, implacably approaching the finish. You realize that, with enough training, you could bridge the cognitive divide between you and them. “If I just buckle down and learn my multiplication tables, I can run shoulder to shoulder with Sara and Jimbo.” You think. They’re not so different from you, they just didn’t spend six months re-watching The Jersey Shore. This thought lightens all your burdens. You push on with renewed spirits. Nothing can stop you now.  Well, don’t get carried away chief, because you stagger across the finish line like a spastic newborn giraffe doing the Butterfly and proceed to void your bowels, which is just damn embarrassing. But you made it. By Jove you made it! At that moment, a man comes trotting by your fetal form. His steps are springy and there’s a curious clinking noise that accompanies his gait. He’s got a mischievous grin and intelligent eyes. He doesn’t appear to be sweating and his breathing is relaxed. How curious, you think. Well, at least you beat one person in this godawful pummeling of pavement. “Tough break, my man.” You offer your condolences to the stranger as he sails past you with a good natured laugh. “That’s Richard Feynman.” Someone says. “Poor bastard.” You cough. “That’s his tenth lap. He just does this shit for fun.” As the peculiar man recedes into the periphery, you catch a glint of metal. Beneath his shorts you see what appear to be cybernetic ostrich legs.Well, shit, that wasn’t as uplifting as I intended it to be. My point is: There’s smart people that you can imagine emulating through linear improvements, and then there are people like Richard Feynman, who are a different kind of athlete (and arguably a damned cheater). If you read this book you’ll come to know a bit about an affable rascal, a maverick, a first principles thinker with a wicked sense of humor who was insatiably curious about the natural world. A person who wasn’t comfortable with understanding anything superficially, or expressing it in a nauseatingly ostentatious way. He had a low tolerance for horseshit, saying a lot that means very little, (forgive me, Dick), sloppy reasoning, people pretending to know things they can’t possibly know, and making things more complicated than they need to be. Here is a brief (far from exhaustive) list of things he applied his alien intellect to:Quantum Electrodynamics.Statistical Mechanics.Parallel ComputingRadio construction and repair.Playing bongo drums.Superfluidity.Criticizing the educational system’s emphasis on rote memorization.Quarks.Painting.Participating in humanity’s potential swan song at Los Alamos.Safe cracking.Taking a cudgel to uppity philosophers.Teaching.Sussing out bureaucratic and engineering malfeasance in the wake of The Challenger Disaster.Coercing ants to follow pheromone trails.Cultivating an eccentric personality which makes for an interesting portfolio of anecdotes which comprise the bulk of this book.Threatening to piss through a man in a bar bathroom.Metabolizing oxygen.Offering the best quote of all time on his death bed. “I’d hate to die twice. It’s so boring.”Feynman is a personal hero of mine, and this is one of the greatest autobiographies ever written. It is genuinely funny, and if you come away from it without wanting to know more about how things really work, well, you’re dead to me. Let’s go out with a quote, because I’ve exhausted my word-bag.“It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn’t get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.”Despair of your position on the continuum of human intellect with this book!"
69,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/300186-penny,5,"Feynman is a physicist who taught at Cornell and Princeton, worked on the Manhattan Project and won the Nobel Prize. He's also a complete hoot. The book is a series of autobiographical stories -- pranks pulled as a student at MIT and at Los Alamos, teaching himself to paint, scientific discoveries he made, his three marriages, how he was rejected by the draft board for being mentally suspect (they asked him if he ever heard voices and he said yes he did and then went on to describe what he found interesting about that. He said that sometimes when falling in and out of sleep he'd imagine conversations with his foreign-born colleagues and the voices in his head spoke accurately with their accents -- but that if he tried to imitate such accents he could not do so at all. So how was it that one part of his brain had captured accents correctly but another hadn't? This was entirely typical of Feynman's wide ranging curiosity and intelligence, but the end result in this case was that the psychologists decided he was nuts. His colleagues at Cornell were vastly amused by this.)What I love about Feynman -- first of all, his great interest in everything and his willingness to experiment. The great joy he found in working things through (he said that the reason he'd never tried drugs, though he was tempted, was that he enjoyed thinking too much and didn't want to risk that.) Also, he's clearly so very intelligent and reading his book, his thoughts seem so easy to follow -- it makes the world of science seem accessible."
70,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,3,"There’s presumably a rule where only smart people are awarded Nobel Prizes in Physics. Richard Feynman was no exception. This memoir is filled with anecdotes from his childhood spent fixing radios, his experiences as a young man doing bomb research at Los Alamos up through his days as a renowned professor at Cal Tech. The central theme was always that this is one smart cookie. It was interesting to pick up on his thought processes. It probably didn’t feature as much pure science as most of his other books, but at least you could appreciate his intuition into the physical world’s biggest puzzles. Rather than emphasizing the technical details of physics, most of his stories were focused on his other interests and his geeky humor.While some of the stories were entertaining, and the lumens of candle power abounded, it didn’t always work for me. I kept getting the feeling that had the same stories been told in the third person, they would have been better – less egotistical sounding. In every one of his sidelines, he was masterful. It was like he was still driving home the point of how brilliant he was even when he was slumming it. After a while, I got tired of hearing how he became fluent in Portuguese when he taught in Brazil, or impressed the locals to no end with his distinctive style of bongo playing, or could dance like a professional, or got just about any woman he wanted to sleep with him. It was this last one that left the worst taste in my mouth. Some of his tales of attraction and conquest occurred when one of his wives was on her death bed. He was probably not as bad as I’ve made him sound. Like I said, we can certainly appreciate his intellect. He had a rare ability to explain difficult concepts in laymen’s terms, too. I got a confirmation of this a week after I finished the book when we were interviewing a former student of his from Cal Tech. He mentioned the “Feynman Effect”: a phenomenon whereby someone asking him a question got answered in such a clear and intuitive way that it was only later that they realized they still didn’t know exactly how it all tied to their existing understanding.So, count me as a fan of his scientific contributions and his ability to communicate, but not of his swagger. If it had all been a bit of a joke (you know, physicist … funny hair … limited social skills … but a would-be Lothario in spite of it), I would have laughed along with him, but I don’t think that was his intention. "
71,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/995651-nick,1,"One of the problems with reading a book written by a genius is that you have to ask yourself whether any perceived deficiencies in the text are due to the author, or due to your own failure to comprehend his brilliance. That said, I wasn't thrilled by this book. On a purely technical level, it would have benefited from a stronger editor. While there's a rough chronological order to the material, there tends to be a lot of jumping around both within and between the chapters. A few times, Feynman would relate some post-WWII anecdote, only to jump back to something that happened during his time at Los Alamos in the early 1940s. He'll mention that he divorced his second wife, and then shortly thereafter tell a story set during the marriage. It gives the book a very disjointed quality.On a more personal level, Feynman just doesn't strike me as someone you'd want to spend time with. About 30% of his stories talk about a time he pulled a fast one on somebody, or how he did something arrogant and obnoxious and it developed into an incident. Reading this book feels like babysitting a very rambunctious toddler--as amusing as his antics may be, you're can't help but looking forward to it being over. And while it's perhaps unfair to judge his behavior by modern standards, some of the womanizing and borderline misogyny (as when he decides that the best way to pick up women in bars is to treat them badly and call them whores) is a bit disappointing. Feynman's scientific accomplishments may be beyond reproach, but I doubt I'll spend any more time with his memoirs."
72,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9974807-tess-j,1,"Listen, I read this a long time ago but here's the thing about it. I'm a big sience fan, and I've always heard how brilliant and funny Richard Feynman was, especially because of his connection to the UofC. But I loathed this book. I suppose it's a memoir, and I don't know if it's ghost written or not, but what was supposed to endear me to Mr Feynman made him revolting to me. According to this book, he treated other people like dirt and thought it was hilarious, he correlated pure intelligence with worth, and he dismissed and disrespected everyone who he felt was not as intellectual as he was (and being that he was a genius, that was most of everybody). Perhaps this is melodramatic, but he sickened me a touch. His blatant disrespect for the work of other scholars in the guise of a patronizing outlook is wholly demoralizing, and for people who wished to pursue a degree in the sciences under him I can't even imagine what it was like to deal with his pomp and ego. I know that the persona displayed in memoirs is different than the actual personality of a person, but the gleeful manner in which he presents his attitude does nothing to disprove my issues with his style. "
73,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,2,"The Nobel prize winning physicist, acclaimed drummer, artist, expert on Mayan astronomy, safecracker, prankster, etc, etc, tells “crazy adventures” of his life. They’re really not “crazy adventures,” these anecdotes; my own father's are easily just as rich and bizarre. Feynman came off to me as a somewhat unpleasant character: he was full to the brim of himself; his false modesty (“I’m too dim to realize when to keep my mouth shut, I just say what I think”) was cloying and annoying, as were his amazement at anyone else’s talent (a professional drummer is far better than him at the drums; this “shocks” him), his claims to understand nature better than artists, and his thinly-veiled put-downs of anyone even remotely concerned with the abstract. He was just the kind of jerk who, caught up in his criticism of others’ inability to grasp his broad points, never begins to wonder whether he is the one missing the gist. Also, his anecdotes are not fleshed out with context: who exactly are the people he’s talking to? When was this? I don’t care. In all, funny and interesting at times (at Los Alamos, on a committee to select school text books), but mainly kind of mundane."
74,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80479-peter-frazier,5,"This amusing little book of anecdotes had an alarmingly influential role in my life. It convinced me of the odd notion that it would be a good idea to go to Caltech and major in physics. In retrospect, this would have been a better idea had I been born around 1930 and was starting my scientific career around 1940, but nowadays it's a tough slog in physics, both money-wise and also discovery-wise. I think that people like Bohr and Planck and Einstein and Feynman discovered all the good stuff in physics and that future theory will be more difficult and less beautiful (though perhaps these string-theorists put my foot in my mouth). I wish I had realized all this when I was 17 rather than 24, but all is not lost: physics is wonderful training for all manner of mathematical disciplines, and all has worked out for the best. I retain a deep fondness for this book, and rereading old passages brings me comfort. If you ever have the choice between reading this book and doing something productive and worthwhile, I recommend that you read this book. All will work out for the best for you too."
75,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder,4,"Laugh out loud funny. My dad read this outloud to us when we were kids - I'm guessing at the exact year - and the whole family literally cried with laughter many times during the performance. Feyman's other memoirs are good too, but this is the funniest. I still think of it often. For instance, every time I use a combination lock, I think of his safe-cracking phase, and how it's every child's dream to learn how to crack safes and get at all that secret and valuable stuff. Which really sums up this book - Mr. Feyman approached life with the curiosity and glee of a small boy. He never lost that childlike sense of wonder or mischief.My only caveat - Mr. Feyman was quite the ladies' man, and there is a certain old-school misogyny in his style of writing about women. Looked at in the most charitable light possible, it's a reminder that he was human, as well as a genius physicist, and frankly, not always right. It doesn't make him any less of an amazing physicist, but it does remind us that he was mortal too.And after reading all of his memoirs, I began to suspect that his cavalier attitude towards women arose at least in part from his grief at the loss of his first wife, who died of cancer at a very young age (her early 20s, if I remember correctly), while he was busy working on the nuclear bomb in Los Alamos. She is the only woman he writes tenderly about - after that, the talk shifts to conquests and getting girls naked. His descriptions of his subsequent marriages lack the warmth of that first marriage, even if there is more fodder for humor. Something about it rings hollow even in Feyman's warm, humorous, self-deprecating voice. There is a real tragedy written between the lines here."
76,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2467151-elizabeth-k,2,"This was disappointing, because I've been wanting to read this for a while because he is so renown for being quite the hilarious character as well as a Nobel prize-winning physicist. This is a collection of essays that serves as a memoir; many are not directly related to physics, but that's definitely the theme. After reading this, my conclusion is that Feynman was mostly a world class knob. He lost me fairly early into it, when he described how you could see physics in action in the everyday world by messing with a waitress's tips. How very droll of you, Mr. Feynman. He is certainly quite the character in the same sense your annoying neighbor is quite the character, the kind who sees you unloading your groceries from the car and saunters over to give you pointless advice about his expert analysis on the best way to unload groceries without helping you, driving you to grit your teeth and nod as you flee toward your door because anything you might say in response, such as ""shut UP, annoying guy!"" would result in him saying ""Aw shucks, I can't help it that I'm smarter than you."" Many demerits for egregious overuse of the exclamation point.Grade: C-Recommended: Not really, although the essays set during his time at Los Alamos are somewhat interesting given the historical context. I suppose it's possible he really was charming and amusing in real life, but you wouldn't know it from his writing."

To follow your dreams, make them happen, make a living out of them, ultimately all this work to be of help for others and above all to enjoy life as you wish to - this is what I call to live your life to the fullest! Mr. Feynman stories are simply wonderful! They are not just funny - they present a man which desire to learn was his motto in life (he owes this desire to his father, a very remarkable man). According to him, anything can be learned as long as you wish for - so very true. If all pupils and students would have teachers like him, the world would be a much better place... I think the saying ""like father, like son"" emerged from their relationship. ;)Some called him corky; others arrogant - and maybe he was. But who are we to judge? I don't think it was easy for him to work on the atomic bomb project - the pressure, the implications... even brilliant minds need a getaway of some form. Maybe when we'll do the things he did we'll get to have a word on this matter. Until then, lets just admire his passion, his dedication and his work.The book does not contain scientific language, calculations or anything alike. Even if you're not interested in physics, this book is more than worth reading. Such a life experience not many can say they had...One more thing: I came across on below interview, produced by BBC in 1981, called The Pleasure Of Finding Things Out. 50 minutes length, worth every second of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgaw9... . It is a shorter version of his memoirs presented in the book and the following fragment is a part of it: People say to me, “Are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?” No I am not. I am just looking to find out more about the world. And if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law that explains everything so be it. That would be very nice discovery. If it turns out it’s like an onion with millions of layers and we just sick and tired of looking at the layers then that’s the way it is! But whatever way it comes out it’s nature, it’s there, and she’s going to come out the way she is.If you decide to put it on your to-read list, I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did :)"

He has been a hero of mine since I was very young, probably because my father also greatly admires him and spoke to me about Feynman and his unique personality from time to time.There are some great stories in this book and they will make you laugh out loud. Feynman was always so full of life and he was curious about absolutely everything from a very early age. He would always want to know, ""How does that work?"" or ""Why is that the way it is?"" or ""Is there another way to do that?"" He would also latch onto something and decide that he wanted to do it, and to do it really well. For example, witnessing the bongo-playing in Brazil inspired him to learn to play like that and not like some studio-taught purist. He achieved it through dedication to his objective and sheer passion.What made Feynman a genius? Well, there were lots of factors that contributed to his status, many of them discussed in other reviews of this book, but, my reason for putting him into that classification was that he was capable of explaining the most complex of matters to a five-year-old. That is TRUE genius.I have read this book many times. It is a short book and will remain amongst my collection until the day that I die. If you haven't read it already, you should. You really need to read this book. I can guarantee that it will change at least one aspect of your life!"

This is a captivating story of an amazing life that could not have been better had it been scripted at birth.Mr. Feynman has done it all. I loved the feeling of tagging along on this brilliant, Nobel-prize winning physicist’s life. A little eccentric yes, but the narrative flows in a very conversational manner (which is a style I like very much). From his early life, to his work on the atomic bomb, to his ability to crack safes, I could not help but admire his chutzpah and proven success. This ""nerd"" even had tremendous success with the ladies. Therefore, on behalf of nerds everywhere, you are our hero!He, like Robert Todd Lincoln, was always lucky enough to be at the right place at the right time in history. The difference is that Feynman tended to be around for the more auspicious historical events. Truly, there are not enough adjectives to describe his amazing talents, admirable life, and impressive success. Among the many biographies I’ve read, only one other person gets this summation, “Remarkable...a life well lived.” That person? Abigail Adams"
81,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,4,"This collection of stories was a tad bit uneven, but overall a helluva lot of fun! Feynman’s childlike curiosity and enthusiasm are infectious; he was a really likeable guy. With respect to math and science, Feynman made some excellent points about the dangers of rote memorization. People often mistakenly think that they’ve grasped something, but they’ve merely memorized facts rather than genuinely understood the thing conceptually. He also pointed out that with science, as with life in general, it is important to PLAY. We tend to lose sight of this far too often.As you’d expect, there is an abundance of humor in these anecdotes. My favorite funny part was when Feynman got into his first fight in a bar:
“One time I was in the men’s room of the bar and there was a guy at the urinal. He was kind of drunk, and said to me in a mean-sounding voice, ‘I don’t like your face. I think I’ll push it in.’I was scared green. I replied in an equally mean voice, ‘Get out of my way, or I’ll pee right through ya!’”
Best response ever."

An incredible life of one of the prodigious thinkers is summarized in less than 400 pages. I would not have put it down even if the book was 4000 pages long, so interesting is the story, a real page-turner.Apparently, by not taking life so seriously Dr. Feynman achieved some remarkably serious things which led to Nobel prize, and other remarkable accomplishments. How many other Nobel prize laureates have safe cracking as a hobby? The book is not just an entertaining story about an extraordinary life. The reader will find some invaluable wisdom about the essence of science, curiosity, creativity, teaching, science ethics, and life morals.I knew, believed, and always felt that curiosity is an essential ingredient of a purposeful life. Feynman, by his life, proved the point. For everybody seeking inspiration and curious about one of the most curious, and where it all might lead, this is a charming book which will probably be a jump-start to other Feynman’s books."

It’s obvious that they have a high functioning mind, which is the cause of such provocative mischievousness, and what follows next is what we already know, when they are constantly being told by their teachers! “You better use your mind to score good grades”.I think that’s the problem with our education system. It leaves no space for free thinking, it doesn’t let the students to think differently and to let them learn by experiments, by failed attempts, this is why most of us begin to lose interest in science because what we learn doesn’t really stay with us for a long time, since we don’t even understand the whys and hows behind the things!What makes a wind-up toy go? I thought, “I know what it is: They’re going to talk about mechanics, how the springs work inside the toy; about chemistry, how the engine of the automobile works; and biology, about how the muscles work.”If this makes you wonder why you never had a teacher who made you question everything and in turn made the process of learning interesting, then this book is for you! Professor Feynman (with his puzzle drive for discovering what’s the matter with things to figure out what to do to fix it) is the teacher you are looking for!This book is not an autobiography in its absolute sense, it’s rather a recollection of the adventures of a curious character which will give you a new world view to understand the genius behind a prankster and his indignant impatience with pretentious pompous fools and their hypocrisy.Its hilarious anecdotes (which are divided into wacky yet fascinating chapters) of fixing radio by thinking, stealing a door, learning biology with a map of a cat, fooling safecracker by safecracking, testing bloodhounds, not making decisions by refusing offers, receiving Nobel prize for the pleasure of discovering what he did, drawing and selling his beautiful artworks and learning to be an occasional jerk to women to get laid and playing with ants and bongo professionally, will surely hook you till the end.Like all smart people he might come across as a narcissist but if you have an admiration for geeky humour coupled with a razor-sharp wit and are curious enough to understand what sets his thought process apart from his brilliant peers, you might discover Feynman techniques to learn how to maintain an open but skeptical mind to look at things differently and your life will never be the same again!Following are the few things that I learned from this book, which I will never forget!You should have your passions – but also have some hobbies and strive to be extremely good at them by being really interested and keep on practising till you learn to do it fairly well, be attentive, use your own knowledge to try it differently from what is usually the practice. Learn from people around, don’t fear to experiment, gain new experiences, so that you have a story to tell, be notorious to exercise your brain but never hurt anyone. Be considerate and helpful! Learn how things work and to truly understand something, question why it is the way it is, what’s its use. Don’t memorize the definition of words and formulas but learn its application, learn with the help of examples and always make sure that the source of knowledge you are using is correct, always cross-check it by yourself. Learn what the rest of the world is like because the variety is always worthwhile."

Made me take interest in physics around us again. :)Feynman was surely a man of multiple lives, how could anybody live so much? Physicist, safe cracker, artist, frigideira (an instrument used in Samba music) player, nobel prize laureate, drummer, and more. His mischievous nature and varied interests (exploration of hypnotism and sense deprivation, e.g.) were inspiring in a way.As a scientist, he leaves out important messages primarily in the chapters: O Americano, Outra Vez! (later part, pg. 211 onwards, about state of science education in Brazil at the time); Is Electricity Fire? (on Jewish (dis)interest in science); Judging Books by their Covers (review of school math books, and disappointment obtained from them); and lastly, Cargo Cult Science, the last chapter.A must read for any science-loving person."
86,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10976459-irena,4,"This book's been recommended to me by my boyfriend and after giving it a 5-page trial, I got sucked right into it!I partially read it, partially listened to the audiobook (which was, imho, done really well and was so pleasant to listen to while doing puzzle or gaming or whatnot).I loved the very beginning, his childhood, where he was so curious and so sweet about his early discoveries. The rest of his science-related work as well as hobbies (drumming, painting, lock-picking, math duels, pranks, school book selection and more) can be preeety much summarized to..well, this picture:Feynman was definitely no bore. I love his way of everyday thinking: so practical, stripped of any tedious theorizing and philosophical blabber. Like in that part where he visits the biology department and find out that all the students memorize so many facts by heart when they could just look it up quickly. So I went to the librarian in the biology section and asked her if she could find me a map of the cat. ""A map of the cat, sir?"" she asked, horrified. ""You mean a zoological chart!"" From then on there were rumors about some dumb biology graduate student who was looking for a ""map of the cat.""  When it came time for me to give my talk on the subject, I started off by drawing an outline of the cat and began to name the various muscles. The other students in the class interrupt me: ""We know all that!"" ""Oh,"" I say, ""you do? Then no wonder I can catch up with you so fast after you had four years of biology."" They had wasted all their time memorizing stuff like that, when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes.""It's a really interesting, easy read - I really enjoyed this one, both in written and in audio form. And my most favourite part:  When I sat with the philosophers I listened to them discuss very seriously a book called Process and Reality by Whitehead. [...]First of all, I sat there without saying anything, which is almost unbelievable, but also true. A student gave a report on the chapter to be studied that week. In it Whitehead kept using the words ""essential object"" in a particular technical way that presumably he had defined, but that I didn't understand. After some discussion as to what ""essential object"" meant, the professor leading the seminar said something meant to clarify things and drew something that looked like lightning bolts on the blackboard. ""Mr. Feynman,"" he said, ""would you say an electron is an 'essential object'?"" Well, not I was in trouble. I admitted that I hadn't read the book, so I had no idea of what Whitehead meant by the phrase; I had only come to watch. ""But,"" I said, ""I'll try to answer the professor's question if you will first answer a question from me, so I can have a better idea of what 'essential object' means. Is a brick an essential object? [...] Then the answers came out. One man stood up and said, ""A brick as an individual, specific brick. THAT is what Whitehead means by an essential object."" Another man said ""No, it isn't the individual brick that is an essential object; it's the general character that all bricks have in common - their 'brickness' - that is the essential object."" Another guy got up and said, ""No, it's not in the bricks themselves. 'Essential object' means the idea in the mind that you get when you think of bricks."" Another guy got up, and another, and I tell you I have never heard such ingenious different ways of looking at a brick before.[image error]Now, did I mention the book gets hilarious at moments? :D Feynman was in Kyoto, trying to learn Japanese. So his lesson go like: One day he was teaching me the word for ""see."" ""All right,"" he said, ""You want to say, 'May I see your garden?' What do you say?"" I made up a sentence with the word that I just learned. ""No, no!"" he said. ""When you say to someone, ""Would you like to see my garden? you use the first 'see.' But when you want to see someone else's garden, you must use another 'see,' which is more polite."" ""Would you like to glance at my lousy garden?"" is essentially what you're saying in the first case, but when you want to look at the other fella's garden, you have to say something like, ""May I observe your gorgeous garden?"" So there's two different words you have to use.  Then he gave me another one: ""You go to a temple, and you want to look at the gardens..."" I made up a sentence, this time with the polite ""see."" ""No, no!"" he said. ""In the temple, the gardens are much more elegant. So you have to say something that would be equivalent to 'May I hang my eyes on your most exquisite gardens?'""*sigh* :'DI won't go into discussion of Feynman as a person outside of the science world. All I can conclude is that intelligence and morale do not have to coincide. Instead, I'll just troll the science a bit below :D brace yourself!"
87,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"This was a compilation of stories that Feynman tells from his own point of view. They were great. He seemed like a great guy. He was so full of life & had such an interest in it. From learning to pick locks, learn a different language, art, or music, he threw himself into the endeavor & did pretty well at it. I can appreciate that. He spent more time on these than he did on his work which is well documented elsewhere. I have Quantum Man: Richard Feynman's Life in Science in my queue, but I don't know when I'll get to it.He rarely had a bad word about anyone even when he was obviously disappointed in their choices. He sounds like a great teacher. He taught himself much (trig!) & I really liked the way he thought through problems, by building it in his head. I try to do that, but thought I was weird. I'll try harder from now on since I know I'm not. Many of the life lessons he passes along I've learned myself already, but they were still good ones.I'd heard he wasn't all that pleased with his Nobel Prize, but it was interesting to hear it from him. Considering what else he had said about his life to that point, it made a lot of sense.The bits on education were wonderful to listen to. I'd really liked to have had him as a teacher. I wish I could say I was shocked at the deplorable state of educational books that are being used on our children, but I was subject to them & so were my kids, so I know first hand. I can't say that the stupidity of the selection process surprised me either. The last section on how science should be performed & the standards it should be held to were great. It's especially important today when there is so much more to know, our technology has advanced so far, & is based on older methods. Several times lately, I've read articles that have stated facts that didn't add up to me. I've checked the studies they cited & found that they were 50 years old! No one has repeated the study in all that time?Great read & highly recommended."

In this autobiography, Feynman goes over his adventures growing up in NYC, at MIT, Princeton, Cornell, Caltech and other locales. He writes in a down to earth style of a wise guy who revolutionized Quantum Field Theory. The book doesn't go much into his physics but his experiences as a prankster and tinkerer and safecracker and adventurer as he goes from one episode to another. Interesting guy."
89,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33262643-titas-i-read-in-bed,5,"Physics is like sex!Today we will talk about a scientist who was an extraordinary man, known as a teacher, lover, master safe cracker (who stole papers of Manhattan Project), fan of Las Vegas’s strip clubs, exceptional liar, musician, artist and probably the most brilliant, influential, and iconoclastic figure in his field in the post-World War II era.How does one define a role model? A prodigy, hard-worker, achiever, winner in the field one is interested in, right? Well in that case the Nobel Prize winner theoretical Physicist Richard P. Feynman is a perfect candidate as role model to physicists. He was dangerously smart and an exceptional teacher. But underneath everything we generally know about him as a scientist, he had a curios and alarmingly mischievous mind that knew no boundaries.First let me just mention some of his works:During World War II Feynman was recruited to serve as a staff member of the U.S. atomic bomb project at Princeton University (1941-42). He was co-awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work. Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology.Enough with the facts already! Now lets talk about the wisdom he left behind!While stealing papers of Nuclear bombing, you should leave mysterious clues: Feynman was a master of desk wiping, lock picking and safe cracking. He even used to think about the mentality and psychology of the safe owner to crack faster. He once cracked three safes of Manhattan project and left certain clues as a mysterious mastermind. Why? Oh just for the fun of course!If you have to lie, lie with full confidence: It doesn’t matter if what you are saying is absolute truth or not. Even if you are unsure, don’t show it. Just go through it in full throttle judging the situation. Example- Feynman once got on stage and recited a jibrish with just the few words he knew in a foreign language. When one doubtfully asked if it was wrong, he replied that the man didn’t understand the depth of the recital!If you’re in Vegas and short in money, act as drunk friends of the strippers: I don’t even have the courage and experience to explain this one.Love what you do and do what you love: In his own words- “Physics is like sex: sure it may give some practical result, but that’s not why we do it.”Know yourself, find where you belong and embrace your faults: “I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.”“That’s the trouble with not being in your own field: You don’t take it seriously.”“All the time you’re saying to yourself, ‘I could do that, but I won’t,’–which is just another way of saying that you can’t.”And most important of all- don’t lie to yourself: “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”Even after being a dashing lover and romantic husband, Feynman was a phenomenal teacher (yes, this man was everything one wishes to be). His series of books 
The Feynman Lectures on Physics
 is perhaps the most popular physics book ever written which Nature described the book as having “simplicity, beauty, unity … presented with enthusiasm and insight”.Although he had experimented with LSD and Marijuana just because he was curious about the effects, he was was a damn fine fellow when it came to the meaning and purpose of life. To him the purpose was knowledge as he had described, “I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there.”A boy who knew how radios work, a student who invented his own mathematical symbols for better understanding, an undergraduate who stole a door, the only scientist who watched Atom Bomb test (Trinity test) without wearing glasses, and the only scientist ever who had asked a reporter if he can refuse the Nobel Prize because he didn’t like to answer too many phone calls – Mr. Feynman had lived a life that we live in 4 or 5 lives summed up together. Why? For the glory of knowledge of course! He was an unique personality beyond rules and paths.Thus like many many other students of physics, if I’m asked about my role model, it is none other than R. P. Feynman- a man who understood very very early that one should focus on understanding instead of just knowing things. Reading about all his life and life’s works one wonders what an honour it would have been to see him once face to face. The man who must have been the only one to appear in the world of Physics with such energy and brilliance.Read this semi-autobiographic book to experience something like never before.In his precious word, a person should live a life 
“where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.”

90,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162027-emily,2,"This book of anecdotes is written in a very casual, fun way that makes it easy to read. The problem is that the author, Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Dick Feynman, is annoying. All the anecdotes involve him discovering a hidden talent, using it, delighting others (or himself if that's his real goal) and then being applauded for it (sometimes only by himself). For example, he discovers that he's a great artist, musician, safecracker, and critic. Everything revolves around him showing off and being somewhat of a jerk. There were many times when I thought, yeah buddy, *you* think it's funny but no one else does. A few stories like this and it's quirky but piled on top of each other, it's annoying.I can't really recommend this book. Maybe mischevious self-aggrandizing guys would enjoy it but otherwise, I suggest a pass."
91,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,5,"This book was a pure delight. The subtitle ""Adventures of a Curious Character"" is spot-on. Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life, thought a series of stories.One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things. You would think a world-famous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics - but Feynman was curious about everything he saw. He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show, he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them, he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling, he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women, he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun - the list goes on! My take: you should have your passions - but you should also have your hobbies. I think I need a new hobby :)I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system. He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to. I think this is not a unique problem in education.Another lesson learned from Feynman's studies of science is to never take any data for granted. Always always question the sources. Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would re-generate many of the numbers on his own - even if they had been published in other places. For many things we are (and not just in science) standing on the shoulders of giants. The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with. I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist, with real integrity. And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles. This book was a light-hearted attempt to point that out - not to mention, a very entertaining read."

“Would you like cream or lemon in your tea, Mr. Feynman?” It’s Mrs. Eisenhart, pouring tea.“I’ll have both, thank you,” I say, still looking for where I’m going to sit, when suddenly I hear “Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Surely you’re joking, Mr. Feynman.”
The title of this collection comes from a tale that took place early in Feynman's career where he was invited for an afternoon tea with the dean of his university. The dean's wife is serving and asks him the above question. Richard never drinks tea and never moves in the same society that does, little own the society that has lemon OR cream with it. A big theme of these stories and indeed a running theme in Feynman's life is that he had no time for formalisms, rituals or societal views. He does attribute a lot of this to his upbringing. His father was a uniform maker and often dealt with clients of all types of notoriety and he knew that underneath all those uniforms were just another naked ape. He passed on his views to his children and Richard went so far as to nearly not accept his Nobel Prize. To him it was another form of bullshit and that his reward had already been awarded with other scientists using his findings.It's no argument that Feynman was a brilliant physicist, but he also had many interests. And a great proportion of these stories are about these interests or how his interests intersected with his physics work. There is only one story in this collection that is technical in any way. The collection reads as if you had somehow run into Feynman in a seedy bar in 1960s Vegas (there's a story about this time) waiting for a showgirl to finish work. He is a great orator and the origins of these stories are that they were recorded and transcribed by Ralph Leighton, a drumming pal of Richard's. Yes, Feynman played the bongos. So while you have this brilliant man, in some ways ahead of his time in the ways that he thought and how he acted, there ares some hints that he is a man of his time. Reading these stories you come to realise that Feynman was quite the womaniser. He appreciated the female form in a socially acceptable way for the time that he lived in. And so when someone from the twenty-first century reads this book he can come across as a bit sleazy. I am not going to defend his attitudes nor am I going to condone them. Personally I found nothing overtly offensive about his actions or his attitudes. But I can imagine my partner reading this and sighing at several statements made by him. The book covers times in his childhood right up until late in life. There is a nice large chapter on his time at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project. There are also stories about his time in Brazil and Japan and his love for immersing himself in a different way of life. There are also a couple of great chapters on education; one about the standard of students he sees while in Brazil and the other concerning a time when he was asked to be on a panel to decide high school texts for his school region. I'd recommend this read to most people. It is extremely accessible, with little jargon or technical physics. It talks more on his philosophy of living, learning and how to deal with the world around you. He is definitely a great orator and that is why his legacy lives on. This book remains a popular seller in the general sciences and recordings of his lectures and interviews are popular on youtube. It's great to know that we still have so much of him around.And for those who want more there are plenty more collections of his wisdom. There is also Feynman a biographic graphic novel."

I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.” ― Richard Feynman, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!I've been circling this book, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, and Gleck's Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman for awhile. This one seemed the most fun and easiest place to start. I was driving from Taos/Santa Fe back to Phoenix last week and as I drove past Los Alamos, it was just the particle collision in my brain I needed to start on Feynman.Often, memoirs are hard to read because you know a bunch of it is façade. A person is showing you a part of them for a purpose. They want to be viewed as smart, important, funny, etc. They carefully guide you through a Potemkin village of their life. Richard Feynman's memoir is different. Not that I don't think Feynman had an ego. He might have even had an agenda with the book. But, for the most part, he seemed much more interested in the stories he wanted to tell, rather than on how they would make him look. He wasn't all that worried about how he looked so much. His entire life was built around doing what he wanted, exploring what he found interesting, violating taboos, beating his own drums and cutting his own path. He was a Nobel-prize winning polymath physicist whose other talents included playing drums, teaching, drawing naked girls, picking locks, making atomic bombs, practical jokes, and telling stories. He wasn't interested in the usual trappings of success. Many of those things annoyed him. He was curious. He was a risk-taker. He was a genius."

When I read this book, I almost feel that Feynman's telling the stories himself. Well, when that happens in real life, you always want to join in; here's my personal best effort at a Feynman-type anecdote. I hope it's now far enough in the past that the people concerned will see the funny side, if they happen to stumble across this page by accident!STAR TREK AND THE PERSONAL SATELLITE ASSISTANTIt was early 2000, and I had just started working at NASA Ames Research Center in California. I was part of this little group that was supposed to be developing spoken language dialogue systems for space applications.

Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.""(Video Review) The story of Feynman changed fundamentally, what I think about the world around me.The story of Richard and his father helped me to understand, that many parents could help their children to a more fulfilling life. Parents could pique the interest of the child very early and could give him real answers if he asks why again and again.He changed my view about scientists. He proved that the life of a scientist can be also “sexy” and interesting and the same time useful and deep activity. You rarely have a chance to meet pedagogues who can help you fall in love with learning and set the fire of science in you, as Feynman did.This book is not only interesting for physicists and scientists, but also for parents and pedagogues who want to inspire their children, students to have a better life. Elon Musk (founder of Tesla) founded a school build on the same principles what Feynman confessed. Where children have a chance to understand the thing work around us, understand the “whys”, and continuously maintain the interest of the students.Of course many people cannot afford this luxury. But also they can profit from these pedagogical principles, even if these seems to be terrifying at the first time as a parent. If you encourage your child to question anybody, you will be also questioned. If you encourage your child, not to defer to different orders, it questions basic societal values of many people and they can be stigmatized being unrespectful. But I think, you will only show a path for your child, which even can lead to the Nobel-prize, but to a happier, more interesting life. And now I am surely not joking."

I'll never make that mistake again, reading the experts' opinions. Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that's the end of you.
I can usually tell when I’m going to give a book 5 stars by one sign: I can’t shut up about it. Well, I couldn’t and can’t shut up about this book; it was simply great. This greatness sort of snuck up on me. I’d recently read a collection of anecdotes by a scientist (A Primate’s Memoir) and found it rather disappointing. Plus, the whole idea of reading a book of stories about a great physicist, without learning any actual physics, seemed silly. But my skepticism had withered away by the end of the first chapter; I was entranced by the man, absolutely fascinated, and remained so the whole time.The subtitle of this book is perfect, because the two meanings of the word “curious” converge to encapsulate Feynman: he was curious in the sense of being odd, as well as curious in his love of learning. I was trying to figure out a way to describe Feynman’s personality, and this is the best I’ve come up with: Feynman is Huck Finn grown up to become a physicist. The qualities that make Mark Twain’s most famous character so endearing are also the qualities that endear Feynman to me: mischievousness, curiosity, cleverness, honesty, naiveté, friendliness, frankness, and an uncompromising moral principle. Like Huck, Feynman is always getting himself into absurd situations, and getting out of them with pure quickness of mind; like Huck, Feynman likes to fool other people and play tricks, but all without a hint of malice; and like Huck, Feynman will stick his neck out for what he feels is right.There are some hilarious stories in here, which I won’t spoil. But what was more impressive to me was the amount of serious thought that could be found. Feynman’s criticism of the Brazilian school system—which relied overmuch on memorization by rote, and concentrated overmuch on passing tests, instead of teaching students how to make sense of the world around them—applies equally well to many aspects of the current U.S. school system. Equally relevant was Feynman’s chapter on the time he served on the board that oversaw the evaluation of math textbooks for the California school system; it was a Kafkaesque farce. But by far the most consistent intellectual theme that went through these reflections was an absolute distrust of pretension, reputation, convention, snobbery, prestige, and authority.In my own life, one of the most interesting, and also most difficult, lessons that I’ve had to learn is that people are not nearly as competent as they’d like you to believe. When I was a kid, I had a lot of faith in all sorts of things. I thought that if an ‘expert’ said something, it must be true; I assumed that there was a particular ‘expert’ in every type of activity, be it business or science, to ensure that things ran the way they were supposed to. In short, I had the comforting illusion that very smart people in very white lab coats were behind the scenes, ensuring that things ran smoothly. The world certainly cooperated with this illusion for a while (after all, that’s the whole basis of advertising); but it wasn’t long after meeting people in the ‘real world’ that this illusion imploded: the world is run by people underqualified and overconfident.I include this bit about myself because I don’t think I would have reacted so emotionally to this rather lighthearted book were it not that I had that experience. In a way, a distrust of all authority is Feynman’s central social message. He is constantly running into ‘experts’ who haven’t the slightest idea what they’re talking about. He goes to academic conferences full of pretentious windbags; he trusts the results of other people’s experiments, and later finds that they were seriously flawed.So any time somebody makes a claim, he decides to test it out for himself; and the few times he doesn’t do this, he gets into trouble. This realization, that most people are inclined to trust claims from authority, is integral to his almost supernatural ability to navigate unfamiliar situations; Feynman is so easily able to bluff his way through because people take his word for things. So this central insight—to always check for youself—is both the heart of his scientific attitude, as well as his way of effortlessly gliding through the world. His ability to crack safes, for example, wasn’t due to his knowing a lot about safes, but simply realizing that most people used their safes foolishly, not resetting the factory combination or setting it to something obvious. Most of us assume that we couldn’t figure out how to crack a safe; but Feynman did what he always did, and saw for himself whether he could: and he could!I honestly wish that this book was three times its length. Now, I must know more about Feynman. My favorite saints are the ones who would hate to be worshiped, and Feynman certainly would think this glowing review was nonsense. Well, perhaps it is; but the only way you’ll know for sure is by reading this book, and checking for yourself."
98,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,5,"Fellers, lemme tell you about one of the smartest sumbitches to ever walk the earth by way of narrative aid. Picture this:  You’ve covered yourself from head to tippy-toe in Vaseline, you’ve been grappling with the concept of higher dimensions all damn night. Engaging in repeated bouts of what could only be described as a physical profanity spawned from the unholy body-karate of Turkish Oil Wrestling, Passive Aggressive Pole Dancing, and Non-Euclidean Interpretive Dance, has sapped you of vital cognitive nutrients. You’re demoralized. There’s no way you’ll understand this. You’re so dumb you couldn’t pour piss out of a boot if the instructions were written on the heel. You might as well give up. Belching forth a line of caustic invectives, you rail against the deities of genetic inheritance, ideal geographic/home conditions, nurturing parents, free access to information, money, wonderful teachers, proper nutrition, interesting peer groups, and lead paint. Then you collapse. During the course of your angry nap, you experience a fitful dream. You’re in the midst of a grueling marathon. Your muscles are bathed in acid. Your lungs are a frozen ball of expanding gas crowding out your innards. With tremendous effort, and cussing so foul memory doesn’t permit you to recall it, you crest a hill. Off in the distance, you see the smartest people you know in your personal life, implacably approaching the finish. You realize that, with enough training, you could bridge the cognitive divide between you and them. “If I just buckle down and learn my multiplication tables, I can run shoulder to shoulder with Sara and Jimbo.” You think. They’re not so different from you, they just didn’t spend six months re-watching The Jersey Shore. This thought lightens all your burdens. You push on with renewed spirits. Nothing can stop you now.  Well, don’t get carried away chief, because you stagger across the finish line like a spastic newborn giraffe doing the Butterfly and proceed to void your bowels, which is just damn embarrassing. But you made it. By Jove you made it! At that moment, a man comes trotting by your fetal form. His steps are springy and there’s a curious clinking noise that accompanies his gait. He’s got a mischievous grin and intelligent eyes. He doesn’t appear to be sweating and his breathing is relaxed. How curious, you think. Well, at least you beat one person in this godawful pummeling of pavement. “Tough break, my man.” You offer your condolences to the stranger as he sails past you with a good natured laugh. “That’s Richard Feynman.” Someone says. “Poor bastard.” You cough. “That’s his tenth lap. He just does this shit for fun.” As the peculiar man recedes into the periphery, you catch a glint of metal. Beneath his shorts you see what appear to be cybernetic ostrich legs.Well, shit, that wasn’t as uplifting as I intended it to be. My point is: There’s smart people that you can imagine emulating through linear improvements, and then there are people like Richard Feynman, who are a different kind of athlete (and arguably a damned cheater). If you read this book you’ll come to know a bit about an affable rascal, a maverick, a first principles thinker with a wicked sense of humor who was insatiably curious about the natural world. A person who wasn’t comfortable with understanding anything superficially, or expressing it in a nauseatingly ostentatious way. He had a low tolerance for horseshit, saying a lot that means very little, (forgive me, Dick), sloppy reasoning, people pretending to know things they can’t possibly know, and making things more complicated than they need to be. Here is a brief (far from exhaustive) list of things he applied his alien intellect to:Quantum Electrodynamics.Statistical Mechanics.Parallel ComputingRadio construction and repair.Playing bongo drums.Superfluidity.Criticizing the educational system’s emphasis on rote memorization.Quarks.Painting.Participating in humanity’s potential swan song at Los Alamos.Safe cracking.Taking a cudgel to uppity philosophers.Teaching.Sussing out bureaucratic and engineering malfeasance in the wake of The Challenger Disaster.Coercing ants to follow pheromone trails.Cultivating an eccentric personality which makes for an interesting portfolio of anecdotes which comprise the bulk of this book.Threatening to piss through a man in a bar bathroom.Metabolizing oxygen.Offering the best quote of all time on his death bed. “I’d hate to die twice. It’s so boring.”Feynman is a personal hero of mine, and this is one of the greatest autobiographies ever written. It is genuinely funny, and if you come away from it without wanting to know more about how things really work, well, you’re dead to me. Let’s go out with a quote, because I’ve exhausted my word-bag.“It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn’t get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.”Despair of your position on the continuum of human intellect with this book!"
99,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/300186-penny,5,"Feynman is a physicist who taught at Cornell and Princeton, worked on the Manhattan Project and won the Nobel Prize. He's also a complete hoot. The book is a series of autobiographical stories -- pranks pulled as a student at MIT and at Los Alamos, teaching himself to paint, scientific discoveries he made, his three marriages, how he was rejected by the draft board for being mentally suspect (they asked him if he ever heard voices and he said yes he did and then went on to describe what he found interesting about that. He said that sometimes when falling in and out of sleep he'd imagine conversations with his foreign-born colleagues and the voices in his head spoke accurately with their accents -- but that if he tried to imitate such accents he could not do so at all. So how was it that one part of his brain had captured accents correctly but another hadn't? This was entirely typical of Feynman's wide ranging curiosity and intelligence, but the end result in this case was that the psychologists decided he was nuts. His colleagues at Cornell were vastly amused by this.)What I love about Feynman -- first of all, his great interest in everything and his willingness to experiment. The great joy he found in working things through (he said that the reason he'd never tried drugs, though he was tempted, was that he enjoyed thinking too much and didn't want to risk that.) Also, he's clearly so very intelligent and reading his book, his thoughts seem so easy to follow -- it makes the world of science seem accessible."
100,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,3,"There’s presumably a rule where only smart people are awarded Nobel Prizes in Physics. Richard Feynman was no exception. This memoir is filled with anecdotes from his childhood spent fixing radios, his experiences as a young man doing bomb research at Los Alamos up through his days as a renowned professor at Cal Tech. The central theme was always that this is one smart cookie. It was interesting to pick up on his thought processes. It probably didn’t feature as much pure science as most of his other books, but at least you could appreciate his intuition into the physical world’s biggest puzzles. Rather than emphasizing the technical details of physics, most of his stories were focused on his other interests and his geeky humor.While some of the stories were entertaining, and the lumens of candle power abounded, it didn’t always work for me. I kept getting the feeling that had the same stories been told in the third person, they would have been better – less egotistical sounding. In every one of his sidelines, he was masterful. It was like he was still driving home the point of how brilliant he was even when he was slumming it. After a while, I got tired of hearing how he became fluent in Portuguese when he taught in Brazil, or impressed the locals to no end with his distinctive style of bongo playing, or could dance like a professional, or got just about any woman he wanted to sleep with him. It was this last one that left the worst taste in my mouth. Some of his tales of attraction and conquest occurred when one of his wives was on her death bed. He was probably not as bad as I’ve made him sound. Like I said, we can certainly appreciate his intellect. He had a rare ability to explain difficult concepts in laymen’s terms, too. I got a confirmation of this a week after I finished the book when we were interviewing a former student of his from Cal Tech. He mentioned the “Feynman Effect”: a phenomenon whereby someone asking him a question got answered in such a clear and intuitive way that it was only later that they realized they still didn’t know exactly how it all tied to their existing understanding.So, count me as a fan of his scientific contributions and his ability to communicate, but not of his swagger. If it had all been a bit of a joke (you know, physicist … funny hair … limited social skills … but a would-be Lothario in spite of it), I would have laughed along with him, but I don’t think that was his intention. "
101,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/995651-nick,1,"One of the problems with reading a book written by a genius is that you have to ask yourself whether any perceived deficiencies in the text are due to the author, or due to your own failure to comprehend his brilliance. That said, I wasn't thrilled by this book. On a purely technical level, it would have benefited from a stronger editor. While there's a rough chronological order to the material, there tends to be a lot of jumping around both within and between the chapters. A few times, Feynman would relate some post-WWII anecdote, only to jump back to something that happened during his time at Los Alamos in the early 1940s. He'll mention that he divorced his second wife, and then shortly thereafter tell a story set during the marriage. It gives the book a very disjointed quality.On a more personal level, Feynman just doesn't strike me as someone you'd want to spend time with. About 30% of his stories talk about a time he pulled a fast one on somebody, or how he did something arrogant and obnoxious and it developed into an incident. Reading this book feels like babysitting a very rambunctious toddler--as amusing as his antics may be, you're can't help but looking forward to it being over. And while it's perhaps unfair to judge his behavior by modern standards, some of the womanizing and borderline misogyny (as when he decides that the best way to pick up women in bars is to treat them badly and call them whores) is a bit disappointing. Feynman's scientific accomplishments may be beyond reproach, but I doubt I'll spend any more time with his memoirs."
102,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9974807-tess-j,1,"Listen, I read this a long time ago but here's the thing about it. I'm a big sience fan, and I've always heard how brilliant and funny Richard Feynman was, especially because of his connection to the UofC. But I loathed this book. I suppose it's a memoir, and I don't know if it's ghost written or not, but what was supposed to endear me to Mr Feynman made him revolting to me. According to this book, he treated other people like dirt and thought it was hilarious, he correlated pure intelligence with worth, and he dismissed and disrespected everyone who he felt was not as intellectual as he was (and being that he was a genius, that was most of everybody). Perhaps this is melodramatic, but he sickened me a touch. His blatant disrespect for the work of other scholars in the guise of a patronizing outlook is wholly demoralizing, and for people who wished to pursue a degree in the sciences under him I can't even imagine what it was like to deal with his pomp and ego. I know that the persona displayed in memoirs is different than the actual personality of a person, but the gleeful manner in which he presents his attitude does nothing to disprove my issues with his style. "
103,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,2,"The Nobel prize winning physicist, acclaimed drummer, artist, expert on Mayan astronomy, safecracker, prankster, etc, etc, tells “crazy adventures” of his life. They’re really not “crazy adventures,” these anecdotes; my own father's are easily just as rich and bizarre. Feynman came off to me as a somewhat unpleasant character: he was full to the brim of himself; his false modesty (“I’m too dim to realize when to keep my mouth shut, I just say what I think”) was cloying and annoying, as were his amazement at anyone else’s talent (a professional drummer is far better than him at the drums; this “shocks” him), his claims to understand nature better than artists, and his thinly-veiled put-downs of anyone even remotely concerned with the abstract. He was just the kind of jerk who, caught up in his criticism of others’ inability to grasp his broad points, never begins to wonder whether he is the one missing the gist. Also, his anecdotes are not fleshed out with context: who exactly are the people he’s talking to? When was this? I don’t care. In all, funny and interesting at times (at Los Alamos, on a committee to select school text books), but mainly kind of mundane."
104,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80479-peter-frazier,5,"This amusing little book of anecdotes had an alarmingly influential role in my life. It convinced me of the odd notion that it would be a good idea to go to Caltech and major in physics. In retrospect, this would have been a better idea had I been born around 1930 and was starting my scientific career around 1940, but nowadays it's a tough slog in physics, both money-wise and also discovery-wise. I think that people like Bohr and Planck and Einstein and Feynman discovered all the good stuff in physics and that future theory will be more difficult and less beautiful (though perhaps these string-theorists put my foot in my mouth). I wish I had realized all this when I was 17 rather than 24, but all is not lost: physics is wonderful training for all manner of mathematical disciplines, and all has worked out for the best. I retain a deep fondness for this book, and rereading old passages brings me comfort. If you ever have the choice between reading this book and doing something productive and worthwhile, I recommend that you read this book. All will work out for the best for you too."
105,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder,4,"Laugh out loud funny. My dad read this outloud to us when we were kids - I'm guessing at the exact year - and the whole family literally cried with laughter many times during the performance. Feyman's other memoirs are good too, but this is the funniest. I still think of it often. For instance, every time I use a combination lock, I think of his safe-cracking phase, and how it's every child's dream to learn how to crack safes and get at all that secret and valuable stuff. Which really sums up this book - Mr. Feyman approached life with the curiosity and glee of a small boy. He never lost that childlike sense of wonder or mischief.My only caveat - Mr. Feyman was quite the ladies' man, and there is a certain old-school misogyny in his style of writing about women. Looked at in the most charitable light possible, it's a reminder that he was human, as well as a genius physicist, and frankly, not always right. It doesn't make him any less of an amazing physicist, but it does remind us that he was mortal too.And after reading all of his memoirs, I began to suspect that his cavalier attitude towards women arose at least in part from his grief at the loss of his first wife, who died of cancer at a very young age (her early 20s, if I remember correctly), while he was busy working on the nuclear bomb in Los Alamos. She is the only woman he writes tenderly about - after that, the talk shifts to conquests and getting girls naked. His descriptions of his subsequent marriages lack the warmth of that first marriage, even if there is more fodder for humor. Something about it rings hollow even in Feyman's warm, humorous, self-deprecating voice. There is a real tragedy written between the lines here."
106,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2467151-elizabeth-k,2,"This was disappointing, because I've been wanting to read this for a while because he is so renown for being quite the hilarious character as well as a Nobel prize-winning physicist. This is a collection of essays that serves as a memoir; many are not directly related to physics, but that's definitely the theme. After reading this, my conclusion is that Feynman was mostly a world class knob. He lost me fairly early into it, when he described how you could see physics in action in the everyday world by messing with a waitress's tips. How very droll of you, Mr. Feynman. He is certainly quite the character in the same sense your annoying neighbor is quite the character, the kind who sees you unloading your groceries from the car and saunters over to give you pointless advice about his expert analysis on the best way to unload groceries without helping you, driving you to grit your teeth and nod as you flee toward your door because anything you might say in response, such as ""shut UP, annoying guy!"" would result in him saying ""Aw shucks, I can't help it that I'm smarter than you."" Many demerits for egregious overuse of the exclamation point.Grade: C-Recommended: Not really, although the essays set during his time at Los Alamos are somewhat interesting given the historical context. I suppose it's possible he really was charming and amusing in real life, but you wouldn't know it from his writing."

To follow your dreams, make them happen, make a living out of them, ultimately all this work to be of help for others and above all to enjoy life as you wish to - this is what I call to live your life to the fullest! Mr. Feynman stories are simply wonderful! They are not just funny - they present a man which desire to learn was his motto in life (he owes this desire to his father, a very remarkable man). According to him, anything can be learned as long as you wish for - so very true. If all pupils and students would have teachers like him, the world would be a much better place... I think the saying ""like father, like son"" emerged from their relationship. ;)Some called him corky; others arrogant - and maybe he was. But who are we to judge? I don't think it was easy for him to work on the atomic bomb project - the pressure, the implications... even brilliant minds need a getaway of some form. Maybe when we'll do the things he did we'll get to have a word on this matter. Until then, lets just admire his passion, his dedication and his work.The book does not contain scientific language, calculations or anything alike. Even if you're not interested in physics, this book is more than worth reading. Such a life experience not many can say they had...One more thing: I came across on below interview, produced by BBC in 1981, called The Pleasure Of Finding Things Out. 50 minutes length, worth every second of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgaw9... . It is a shorter version of his memoirs presented in the book and the following fragment is a part of it: People say to me, “Are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?” No I am not. I am just looking to find out more about the world. And if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law that explains everything so be it. That would be very nice discovery. If it turns out it’s like an onion with millions of layers and we just sick and tired of looking at the layers then that’s the way it is! But whatever way it comes out it’s nature, it’s there, and she’s going to come out the way she is.If you decide to put it on your to-read list, I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did :)"
109,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2793431-lance-greenfield,5,"Brilliant, inspirational and very funny! There can be no argument that Richard P Feynman was a genius. He has been a hero of mine since I was very young, probably because my father also greatly admires him and spoke to me about Feynman and his unique personality from time to time.There are some great stories in this book and they will make you laugh out loud. Feynman was always so full of life and he was curious about absolutely everything from a very early age. He would always want to know, ""How does that work?"" or ""Why is that the way it is?"" or ""Is there another way to do that?"" He would also latch onto something and decide that he wanted to do it, and to do it really well. For example, witnessing the bongo-playing in Brazil inspired him to learn to play like that and not like some studio-taught purist. He achieved it through dedication to his objective and sheer passion.What made Feynman a genius? Well, there were lots of factors that contributed to his status, many of them discussed in other reviews of this book, but, my reason for putting him into that classification was that he was capable of explaining the most complex of matters to a five-year-old. That is TRUE genius.I have read this book many times. It is a short book and will remain amongst my collection until the day that I die. If you haven't read it already, you should. You really need to read this book. I can guarantee that it will change at least one aspect of your life!"

This is a captivating story of an amazing life that could not have been better had it been scripted at birth.Mr. Feynman has done it all. I loved the feeling of tagging along on this brilliant, Nobel-prize winning physicist’s life. A little eccentric yes, but the narrative flows in a very conversational manner (which is a style I like very much). From his early life, to his work on the atomic bomb, to his ability to crack safes, I could not help but admire his chutzpah and proven success. This ""nerd"" even had tremendous success with the ladies. Therefore, on behalf of nerds everywhere, you are our hero!He, like Robert Todd Lincoln, was always lucky enough to be at the right place at the right time in history. The difference is that Feynman tended to be around for the more auspicious historical events. Truly, there are not enough adjectives to describe his amazing talents, admirable life, and impressive success. Among the many biographies I’ve read, only one other person gets this summation, “Remarkable...a life well lived.” That person? Abigail Adams"
111,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,4,"This collection of stories was a tad bit uneven, but overall a helluva lot of fun! Feynman’s childlike curiosity and enthusiasm are infectious; he was a really likeable guy. With respect to math and science, Feynman made some excellent points about the dangers of rote memorization. People often mistakenly think that they’ve grasped something, but they’ve merely memorized facts rather than genuinely understood the thing conceptually. He also pointed out that with science, as with life in general, it is important to PLAY. We tend to lose sight of this far too often.As you’d expect, there is an abundance of humor in these anecdotes. My favorite funny part was when Feynman got into his first fight in a bar:
“One time I was in the men’s room of the bar and there was a guy at the urinal. He was kind of drunk, and said to me in a mean-sounding voice, ‘I don’t like your face. I think I’ll push it in.’I was scared green. I replied in an equally mean voice, ‘Get out of my way, or I’ll pee right through ya!’”
Best response ever."

An incredible life of one of the prodigious thinkers is summarized in less than 400 pages. I would not have put it down even if the book was 4000 pages long, so interesting is the story, a real page-turner.Apparently, by not taking life so seriously Dr. Feynman achieved some remarkably serious things which led to Nobel prize, and other remarkable accomplishments. How many other Nobel prize laureates have safe cracking as a hobby? The book is not just an entertaining story about an extraordinary life. The reader will find some invaluable wisdom about the essence of science, curiosity, creativity, teaching, science ethics, and life morals.I knew, believed, and always felt that curiosity is an essential ingredient of a purposeful life. Feynman, by his life, proved the point. For everybody seeking inspiration and curious about one of the most curious, and where it all might lead, this is a charming book which will probably be a jump-start to other Feynman’s books."

It’s obvious that they have a high functioning mind, which is the cause of such provocative mischievousness, and what follows next is what we already know, when they are constantly being told by their teachers! “You better use your mind to score good grades”.I think that’s the problem with our education system. It leaves no space for free thinking, it doesn’t let the students to think differently and to let them learn by experiments, by failed attempts, this is why most of us begin to lose interest in science because what we learn doesn’t really stay with us for a long time, since we don’t even understand the whys and hows behind the things!What makes a wind-up toy go? I thought, “I know what it is: They’re going to talk about mechanics, how the springs work inside the toy; about chemistry, how the engine of the automobile works; and biology, about how the muscles work.”If this makes you wonder why you never had a teacher who made you question everything and in turn made the process of learning interesting, then this book is for you! Professor Feynman (with his puzzle drive for discovering what’s the matter with things to figure out what to do to fix it) is the teacher you are looking for!This book is not an autobiography in its absolute sense, it’s rather a recollection of the adventures of a curious character which will give you a new world view to understand the genius behind a prankster and his indignant impatience with pretentious pompous fools and their hypocrisy.Its hilarious anecdotes (which are divided into wacky yet fascinating chapters) of fixing radio by thinking, stealing a door, learning biology with a map of a cat, fooling safecracker by safecracking, testing bloodhounds, not making decisions by refusing offers, receiving Nobel prize for the pleasure of discovering what he did, drawing and selling his beautiful artworks and learning to be an occasional jerk to women to get laid and playing with ants and bongo professionally, will surely hook you till the end.Like all smart people he might come across as a narcissist but if you have an admiration for geeky humour coupled with a razor-sharp wit and are curious enough to understand what sets his thought process apart from his brilliant peers, you might discover Feynman techniques to learn how to maintain an open but skeptical mind to look at things differently and your life will never be the same again!Following are the few things that I learned from this book, which I will never forget!You should have your passions – but also have some hobbies and strive to be extremely good at them by being really interested and keep on practising till you learn to do it fairly well, be attentive, use your own knowledge to try it differently from what is usually the practice. Learn from people around, don’t fear to experiment, gain new experiences, so that you have a story to tell, be notorious to exercise your brain but never hurt anyone. Be considerate and helpful! Learn how things work and to truly understand something, question why it is the way it is, what’s its use. Don’t memorize the definition of words and formulas but learn its application, learn with the help of examples and always make sure that the source of knowledge you are using is correct, always cross-check it by yourself. Learn what the rest of the world is like because the variety is always worthwhile."

Made me take interest in physics around us again. :)Feynman was surely a man of multiple lives, how could anybody live so much? Physicist, safe cracker, artist, frigideira (an instrument used in Samba music) player, nobel prize laureate, drummer, and more. His mischievous nature and varied interests (exploration of hypnotism and sense deprivation, e.g.) were inspiring in a way.As a scientist, he leaves out important messages primarily in the chapters: O Americano, Outra Vez! (later part, pg. 211 onwards, about state of science education in Brazil at the time); Is Electricity Fire? (on Jewish (dis)interest in science); Judging Books by their Covers (review of school math books, and disappointment obtained from them); and lastly, Cargo Cult Science, the last chapter.A must read for any science-loving person."

The rest of his science-related work as well as hobbies (drumming, painting, lock-picking, math duels, pranks, school book selection and more) can be preeety much summarized to..well, this picture:Feynman was definitely no bore. I love his way of everyday thinking: so practical, stripped of any tedious theorizing and philosophical blabber. Like in that part where he visits the biology department and find out that all the students memorize so many facts by heart when they could just look it up quickly. So I went to the librarian in the biology section and asked her if she could find me a map of the cat. ""A map of the cat, sir?"" she asked, horrified. ""You mean a zoological chart!"" From then on there were rumors about some dumb biology graduate student who was looking for a ""map of the cat.""  When it came time for me to give my talk on the subject, I started off by drawing an outline of the cat and began to name the various muscles. The other students in the class interrupt me: ""We know all that!"" ""Oh,"" I say, ""you do? Then no wonder I can catch up with you so fast after you had four years of biology."" They had wasted all their time memorizing stuff like that, when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes.""It's a really interesting, easy read - I really enjoyed this one, both in written and in audio form. And my most favourite part:  When I sat with the philosophers I listened to them discuss very seriously a book called Process and Reality by Whitehead. [...]First of all, I sat there without saying anything, which is almost unbelievable, but also true. A student gave a report on the chapter to be studied that week. In it Whitehead kept using the words ""essential object"" in a particular technical way that presumably he had defined, but that I didn't understand. After some discussion as to what ""essential object"" meant, the professor leading the seminar said something meant to clarify things and drew something that looked like lightning bolts on the blackboard. ""Mr. Feynman,"" he said, ""would you say an electron is an 'essential object'?"" Well, not I was in trouble. I admitted that I hadn't read the book, so I had no idea of what Whitehead meant by the phrase; I had only come to watch. ""But,"" I said, ""I'll try to answer the professor's question if you will first answer a question from me, so I can have a better idea of what 'essential object' means. Is a brick an essential object? [...] Then the answers came out. One man stood up and said, ""A brick as an individual, specific brick. THAT is what Whitehead means by an essential object."" Another man said ""No, it isn't the individual brick that is an essential object; it's the general character that all bricks have in common - their 'brickness' - that is the essential object."" Another guy got up and said, ""No, it's not in the bricks themselves. 'Essential object' means the idea in the mind that you get when you think of bricks."" Another guy got up, and another, and I tell you I have never heard such ingenious different ways of looking at a brick before.[image error]Now, did I mention the book gets hilarious at moments? :D Feynman was in Kyoto, trying to learn Japanese. So his lesson go like: One day he was teaching me the word for ""see."" ""All right,"" he said, ""You want to say, 'May I see your garden?' What do you say?"" I made up a sentence with the word that I just learned. ""No, no!"" he said. ""When you say to someone, ""Would you like to see my garden? you use the first 'see.' But when you want to see someone else's garden, you must use another 'see,' which is more polite."" ""Would you like to glance at my lousy garden?"" is essentially what you're saying in the first case, but when you want to look at the other fella's garden, you have to say something like, ""May I observe your gorgeous garden?"" So there's two different words you have to use.  Then he gave me another one: ""You go to a temple, and you want to look at the gardens..."" I made up a sentence, this time with the polite ""see."" ""No, no!"" he said. ""In the temple, the gardens are much more elegant. So you have to say something that would be equivalent to 'May I hang my eyes on your most exquisite gardens?'""*sigh* :'DI won't go into discussion of Feynman as a person outside of the science world. All I can conclude is that intelligence and morale do not have to coincide. Instead, I'll just troll the science a bit below :D brace yourself!"

He was so full of life & had such an interest in it. From learning to pick locks, learn a different language, art, or music, he threw himself into the endeavor & did pretty well at it. I can appreciate that. He spent more time on these than he did on his work which is well documented elsewhere. I have Quantum Man: Richard Feynman's Life in Science in my queue, but I don't know when I'll get to it.He rarely had a bad word about anyone even when he was obviously disappointed in their choices. He sounds like a great teacher. He taught himself much (trig!) & I really liked the way he thought through problems, by building it in his head. I try to do that, but thought I was weird. I'll try harder from now on since I know I'm not. Many of the life lessons he passes along I've learned myself already, but they were still good ones.I'd heard he wasn't all that pleased with his Nobel Prize, but it was interesting to hear it from him. Considering what else he had said about his life to that point, it made a lot of sense.The bits on education were wonderful to listen to. I'd really liked to have had him as a teacher. I wish I could say I was shocked at the deplorable state of educational books that are being used on our children, but I was subject to them & so were my kids, so I know first hand. I can't say that the stupidity of the selection process surprised me either. The last section on how science should be performed & the standards it should be held to were great. It's especially important today when there is so much more to know, our technology has advanced so far, & is based on older methods. Several times lately, I've read articles that have stated facts that didn't add up to me. I've checked the studies they cited & found that they were 50 years old! No one has repeated the study in all that time?Great read & highly recommended."

In this autobiography, Feynman goes over his adventures growing up in NYC, at MIT, Princeton, Cornell, Caltech and other locales. He writes in a down to earth style of a wise guy who revolutionized Quantum Field Theory. The book doesn't go much into his physics but his experiences as a prankster and tinkerer and safecracker and adventurer as he goes from one episode to another. Interesting guy."
119,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33262643-titas-i-read-in-bed,5,"Physics is like sex!Today we will talk about a scientist who was an extraordinary man, known as a teacher, lover, master safe cracker (who stole papers of Manhattan Project), fan of Las Vegas’s strip clubs, exceptional liar, musician, artist and probably the most brilliant, influential, and iconoclastic figure in his field in the post-World War II era.How does one define a role model? A prodigy, hard-worker, achiever, winner in the field one is interested in, right? Well in that case the Nobel Prize winner theoretical Physicist Richard P. Feynman is a perfect candidate as role model to physicists. He was dangerously smart and an exceptional teacher. But underneath everything we generally know about him as a scientist, he had a curios and alarmingly mischievous mind that knew no boundaries.First let me just mention some of his works:During World War II Feynman was recruited to serve as a staff member of the U.S. atomic bomb project at Princeton University (1941-42). He was co-awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work. Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology.Enough with the facts already! Now lets talk about the wisdom he left behind!While stealing papers of Nuclear bombing, you should leave mysterious clues: Feynman was a master of desk wiping, lock picking and safe cracking. He even used to think about the mentality and psychology of the safe owner to crack faster. He once cracked three safes of Manhattan project and left certain clues as a mysterious mastermind. Why? Oh just for the fun of course!If you have to lie, lie with full confidence: It doesn’t matter if what you are saying is absolute truth or not. Even if you are unsure, don’t show it. Just go through it in full throttle judging the situation. Example- Feynman once got on stage and recited a jibrish with just the few words he knew in a foreign language. When one doubtfully asked if it was wrong, he replied that the man didn’t understand the depth of the recital!If you’re in Vegas and short in money, act as drunk friends of the strippers: I don’t even have the courage and experience to explain this one.Love what you do and do what you love: In his own words- “Physics is like sex: sure it may give some practical result, but that’s not why we do it.”Know yourself, find where you belong and embrace your faults: “I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.”“That’s the trouble with not being in your own field: You don’t take it seriously.”“All the time you’re saying to yourself, ‘I could do that, but I won’t,’–which is just another way of saying that you can’t.”And most important of all- don’t lie to yourself: “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”Even after being a dashing lover and romantic husband, Feynman was a phenomenal teacher (yes, this man was everything one wishes to be). His series of books 
The Feynman Lectures on Physics
 is perhaps the most popular physics book ever written which Nature described the book as having “simplicity, beauty, unity … presented with enthusiasm and insight”.Although he had experimented with LSD and Marijuana just because he was curious about the effects, he was was a damn fine fellow when it came to the meaning and purpose of life. To him the purpose was knowledge as he had described, “I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there.”A boy who knew how radios work, a student who invented his own mathematical symbols for better understanding, an undergraduate who stole a door, the only scientist who watched Atom Bomb test (Trinity test) without wearing glasses, and the only scientist ever who had asked a reporter if he can refuse the Nobel Prize because he didn’t like to answer too many phone calls – Mr. Feynman had lived a life that we live in 4 or 5 lives summed up together. Why? For the glory of knowledge of course! He was an unique personality beyond rules and paths.Thus like many many other students of physics, if I’m asked about my role model, it is none other than R. P. Feynman- a man who understood very very early that one should focus on understanding instead of just knowing things. Reading about all his life and life’s works one wonders what an honour it would have been to see him once face to face. The man who must have been the only one to appear in the world of Physics with such energy and brilliance.Read this semi-autobiographic book to experience something like never before.In his precious word, a person should live a life 
“where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.”

120,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162027-emily,2,"This book of anecdotes is written in a very casual, fun way that makes it easy to read. The problem is that the author, Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Dick Feynman, is annoying. All the anecdotes involve him discovering a hidden talent, using it, delighting others (or himself if that's his real goal) and then being applauded for it (sometimes only by himself). For example, he discovers that he's a great artist, musician, safecracker, and critic. Everything revolves around him showing off and being somewhat of a jerk. There were many times when I thought, yeah buddy, *you* think it's funny but no one else does. A few stories like this and it's quirky but piled on top of each other, it's annoying.I can't really recommend this book. Maybe mischevious self-aggrandizing guys would enjoy it but otherwise, I suggest a pass."
121,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,5,"This book was a pure delight. The subtitle ""Adventures of a Curious Character"" is spot-on. Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life, thought a series of stories.One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things. You would think a world-famous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics - but Feynman was curious about everything he saw. He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show, he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them, he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling, he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women, he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun - the list goes on! My take: you should have your passions - but you should also have your hobbies. I think I need a new hobby :)I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system. He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to. I think this is not a unique problem in education.Another lesson learned from Feynman's studies of science is to never take any data for granted. Always always question the sources. Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would re-generate many of the numbers on his own - even if they had been published in other places. For many things we are (and not just in science) standing on the shoulders of giants. The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with. I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist, with real integrity. And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles. This book was a light-hearted attempt to point that out - not to mention, a very entertaining read."

He was a man ahead of his time when it came to many things -- & of his time when it came to his ideas about 'pretty girls' (as he calls women). The audiobook reader did a great job, but what a shame Feynman didn't read it himself before he passed on..."

“Would you like cream or lemon in your tea, Mr. Feynman?” It’s Mrs. Eisenhart, pouring tea.“I’ll have both, thank you,” I say, still looking for where I’m going to sit, when suddenly I hear “Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Surely you’re joking, Mr. Feynman.”
The title of this collection comes from a tale that took place early in Feynman's career where he was invited for an afternoon tea with the dean of his university. The dean's wife is serving and asks him the above question. Richard never drinks tea and never moves in the same society that does, little own the society that has lemon OR cream with it. A big theme of these stories and indeed a running theme in Feynman's life is that he had no time for formalisms, rituals or societal views. He does attribute a lot of this to his upbringing. His father was a uniform maker and often dealt with clients of all types of notoriety and he knew that underneath all those uniforms were just another naked ape. He passed on his views to his children and Richard went so far as to nearly not accept his Nobel Prize. To him it was another form of bullshit and that his reward had already been awarded with other scientists using his findings.It's no argument that Feynman was a brilliant physicist, but he also had many interests. And a great proportion of these stories are about these interests or how his interests intersected with his physics work. There is only one story in this collection that is technical in any way. The collection reads as if you had somehow run into Feynman in a seedy bar in 1960s Vegas (there's a story about this time) waiting for a showgirl to finish work. He is a great orator and the origins of these stories are that they were recorded and transcribed by Ralph Leighton, a drumming pal of Richard's. Yes, Feynman played the bongos. So while you have this brilliant man, in some ways ahead of his time in the ways that he thought and how he acted, there ares some hints that he is a man of his time. Reading these stories you come to realise that Feynman was quite the womaniser. He appreciated the female form in a socially acceptable way for the time that he lived in. And so when someone from the twenty-first century reads this book he can come across as a bit sleazy. I am not going to defend his attitudes nor am I going to condone them. Personally I found nothing overtly offensive about his actions or his attitudes. But I can imagine my partner reading this and sighing at several statements made by him. The book covers times in his childhood right up until late in life. There is a nice large chapter on his time at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project. There are also stories about his time in Brazil and Japan and his love for immersing himself in a different way of life. There are also a couple of great chapters on education; one about the standard of students he sees while in Brazil and the other concerning a time when he was asked to be on a panel to decide high school texts for his school region. I'd recommend this read to most people. It is extremely accessible, with little jargon or technical physics. It talks more on his philosophy of living, learning and how to deal with the world around you. He is definitely a great orator and that is why his legacy lives on. This book remains a popular seller in the general sciences and recordings of his lectures and interviews are popular on youtube. It's great to know that we still have so much of him around.And for those who want more there are plenty more collections of his wisdom. There is also Feynman a biographic graphic novel."

I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.” ― Richard Feynman, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!I've been circling this book, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, and Gleck's Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman for awhile. This one seemed the most fun and easiest place to start. I was driving from Taos/Santa Fe back to Phoenix last week and as I drove past Los Alamos, it was just the particle collision in my brain I needed to start on Feynman.Often, memoirs are hard to read because you know a bunch of it is façade. A person is showing you a part of them for a purpose. They want to be viewed as smart, important, funny, etc. They carefully guide you through a Potemkin village of their life. Richard Feynman's memoir is different. Not that I don't think Feynman had an ego. He might have even had an agenda with the book. But, for the most part, he seemed much more interested in the stories he wanted to tell, rather than on how they would make him look. He wasn't all that worried about how he looked so much. His entire life was built around doing what he wanted, exploring what he found interesting, violating taboos, beating his own drums and cutting his own path. He was a Nobel-prize winning polymath physicist whose other talents included playing drums, teaching, drawing naked girls, picking locks, making atomic bombs, practical jokes, and telling stories. He wasn't interested in the usual trappings of success. Many of those things annoyed him. He was curious. He was a risk-taker. He was a genius."

When I read this book, I almost feel that Feynman's telling the stories himself. Well, when that happens in real life, you always want to join in; here's my personal best effort at a Feynman-type anecdote. I hope it's now far enough in the past that the people concerned will see the funny side, if they happen to stumble across this page by accident!STAR TREK AND THE PERSONAL SATELLITE ASSISTANTIt was early 2000, and I had just started working at NASA Ames Research Center in California. I was part of this little group that was supposed to be developing spoken language dialogue systems for space applications. The guy whose idea it was had started up the group, recruited me and two other people, and then left to join Microsoft Research before I'd even arrived. So everyone was looking at us suspiciously.

Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.""(Video Review) The story of Feynman changed fundamentally, what I think about the world around me.The story of Richard and his father helped me to understand, that many parents could help their children to a more fulfilling life. Parents could pique the interest of the child very early and could give him real answers if he asks why again and again.He changed my view about scientists. He proved that the life of a scientist can be also “sexy” and interesting and the same time useful and deep activity. You rarely have a chance to meet pedagogues who can help you fall in love with learning and set the fire of science in you, as Feynman did.This book is not only interesting for physicists and scientists, but also for parents and pedagogues who want to inspire their children, students to have a better life. Elon Musk (founder of Tesla) founded a school build on the same principles what Feynman confessed. Where children have a chance to understand the thing work around us, understand the “whys”, and continuously maintain the interest of the students.Of course many people cannot afford this luxury. But also they can profit from these pedagogical principles, even if these seems to be terrifying at the first time as a parent. If you encourage your child to question anybody, you will be also questioned. If you encourage your child, not to defer to different orders, it questions basic societal values of many people and they can be stigmatized being unrespectful. But I think, you will only show a path for your child, which even can lead to the Nobel-prize, but to a happier, more interesting life. And now I am surely not joking."

I'll never make that mistake again, reading the experts' opinions. Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that's the end of you.
I can usually tell when I’m going to give a book 5 stars by one sign: I can’t shut up about it. Well, I couldn’t and can’t shut up about this book; it was simply great. This greatness sort of snuck up on me. I’d recently read a collection of anecdotes by a scientist (A Primate’s Memoir) and found it rather disappointing. Plus, the whole idea of reading a book of stories about a great physicist, without learning any actual physics, seemed silly. But my skepticism had withered away by the end of the first chapter; I was entranced by the man, absolutely fascinated, and remained so the whole time.The subtitle of this book is perfect, because the two meanings of the word “curious” converge to encapsulate Feynman: he was curious in the sense of being odd, as well as curious in his love of learning. I was trying to figure out a way to describe Feynman’s personality, and this is the best I’ve come up with: Feynman is Huck Finn grown up to become a physicist. The qualities that make Mark Twain’s most famous character so endearing are also the qualities that endear Feynman to me: mischievousness, curiosity, cleverness, honesty, naiveté, friendliness, frankness, and an uncompromising moral principle. Like Huck, Feynman is always getting himself into absurd situations, and getting out of them with pure quickness of mind; like Huck, Feynman likes to fool other people and play tricks, but all without a hint of malice; and like Huck, Feynman will stick his neck out for what he feels is right.There are some hilarious stories in here, which I won’t spoil. But what was more impressive to me was the amount of serious thought that could be found. Feynman’s criticism of the Brazilian school system—which relied overmuch on memorization by rote, and concentrated overmuch on passing tests, instead of teaching students how to make sense of the world around them—applies equally well to many aspects of the current U.S. school system. Equally relevant was Feynman’s chapter on the time he served on the board that oversaw the evaluation of math textbooks for the California school system; it was a Kafkaesque farce. But by far the most consistent intellectual theme that went through these reflections was an absolute distrust of pretension, reputation, convention, snobbery, prestige, and authority.In my own life, one of the most interesting, and also most difficult, lessons that I’ve had to learn is that people are not nearly as competent as they’d like you to believe. When I was a kid, I had a lot of faith in all sorts of things. I thought that if an ‘expert’ said something, it must be true; I assumed that there was a particular ‘expert’ in every type of activity, be it business or science, to ensure that things ran the way they were supposed to. In short, I had the comforting illusion that very smart people in very white lab coats were behind the scenes, ensuring that things ran smoothly. The world certainly cooperated with this illusion for a while (after all, that’s the whole basis of advertising); but it wasn’t long after meeting people in the ‘real world’ that this illusion imploded: the world is run by people underqualified and overconfident.I include this bit about myself because I don’t think I would have reacted so emotionally to this rather lighthearted book were it not that I had that experience. In a way, a distrust of all authority is Feynman’s central social message. He is constantly running into ‘experts’ who haven’t the slightest idea what they’re talking about. He goes to academic conferences full of pretentious windbags; he trusts the results of other people’s experiments, and later finds that they were seriously flawed.So any time somebody makes a claim, he decides to test it out for himself; and the few times he doesn’t do this, he gets into trouble. This realization, that most people are inclined to trust claims from authority, is integral to his almost supernatural ability to navigate unfamiliar situations; Feynman is so easily able to bluff his way through because people take his word for things. So this central insight—to always check for youself—is both the heart of his scientific attitude, as well as his way of effortlessly gliding through the world. His ability to crack safes, for example, wasn’t due to his knowing a lot about safes, but simply realizing that most people used their safes foolishly, not resetting the factory combination or setting it to something obvious. Most of us assume that we couldn’t figure out how to crack a safe; but Feynman did what he always did, and saw for himself whether he could: and he could!I honestly wish that this book was three times its length. Now, I must know more about Feynman. My favorite saints are the ones who would hate to be worshiped, and Feynman certainly would think this glowing review was nonsense. Well, perhaps it is; but the only way you’ll know for sure is by reading this book, and checking for yourself."
128,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,5,"Fellers, lemme tell you about one of the smartest sumbitches to ever walk the earth by way of narrative aid. Picture this:  You’ve covered yourself from head to tippy-toe in Vaseline, you’ve been grappling with the concept of higher dimensions all damn night. Engaging in repeated bouts of what could only be described as a physical profanity spawned from the unholy body-karate of Turkish Oil Wrestling, Passive Aggressive Pole Dancing, and Non-Euclidean Interpretive Dance, has sapped you of vital cognitive nutrients. You’re demoralized. There’s no way you’ll understand this. You’re so dumb you couldn’t pour piss out of a boot if the instructions were written on the heel. You might as well give up. Belching forth a line of caustic invectives, you rail against the deities of genetic inheritance, ideal geographic/home conditions, nurturing parents, free access to information, money, wonderful teachers, proper nutrition, interesting peer groups, and lead paint. Then you collapse. During the course of your angry nap, you experience a fitful dream. You’re in the midst of a grueling marathon. Your muscles are bathed in acid. Your lungs are a frozen ball of expanding gas crowding out your innards. With tremendous effort, and cussing so foul memory doesn’t permit you to recall it, you crest a hill. Off in the distance, you see the smartest people you know in your personal life, implacably approaching the finish. You realize that, with enough training, you could bridge the cognitive divide between you and them. “If I just buckle down and learn my multiplication tables, I can run shoulder to shoulder with Sara and Jimbo.” You think. They’re not so different from you, they just didn’t spend six months re-watching The Jersey Shore. This thought lightens all your burdens. You push on with renewed spirits. Nothing can stop you now.  Well, don’t get carried away chief, because you stagger across the finish line like a spastic newborn giraffe doing the Butterfly and proceed to void your bowels, which is just damn embarrassing. But you made it. By Jove you made it! At that moment, a man comes trotting by your fetal form. His steps are springy and there’s a curious clinking noise that accompanies his gait. He’s got a mischievous grin and intelligent eyes. He doesn’t appear to be sweating and his breathing is relaxed. How curious, you think. Well, at least you beat one person in this godawful pummeling of pavement. “Tough break, my man.” You offer your condolences to the stranger as he sails past you with a good natured laugh. “That’s Richard Feynman.” Someone says. “Poor bastard.” You cough. “That’s his tenth lap. He just does this shit for fun.” As the peculiar man recedes into the periphery, you catch a glint of metal. Beneath his shorts you see what appear to be cybernetic ostrich legs.Well, shit, that wasn’t as uplifting as I intended it to be. My point is: There’s smart people that you can imagine emulating through linear improvements, and then there are people like Richard Feynman, who are a different kind of athlete (and arguably a damned cheater). If you read this book you’ll come to know a bit about an affable rascal, a maverick, a first principles thinker with a wicked sense of humor who was insatiably curious about the natural world. A person who wasn’t comfortable with understanding anything superficially, or expressing it in a nauseatingly ostentatious way. He had a low tolerance for horseshit, saying a lot that means very little, (forgive me, Dick), sloppy reasoning, people pretending to know things they can’t possibly know, and making things more complicated than they need to be. Here is a brief (far from exhaustive) list of things he applied his alien intellect to:Quantum Electrodynamics.Statistical Mechanics.Parallel ComputingRadio construction and repair.Playing bongo drums.Superfluidity.Criticizing the educational system’s emphasis on rote memorization.Quarks.Painting.Participating in humanity’s potential swan song at Los Alamos.Safe cracking.Taking a cudgel to uppity philosophers.Teaching.Sussing out bureaucratic and engineering malfeasance in the wake of The Challenger Disaster.Coercing ants to follow pheromone trails.Cultivating an eccentric personality which makes for an interesting portfolio of anecdotes which comprise the bulk of this book.Threatening to piss through a man in a bar bathroom.Metabolizing oxygen.Offering the best quote of all time on his death bed. “I’d hate to die twice. It’s so boring.”Feynman is a personal hero of mine, and this is one of the greatest autobiographies ever written. It is genuinely funny, and if you come away from it without wanting to know more about how things really work, well, you’re dead to me. Let’s go out with a quote, because I’ve exhausted my word-bag.“It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn’t get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.”Despair of your position on the continuum of human intellect with this book!"
129,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/300186-penny,5,"Feynman is a physicist who taught at Cornell and Princeton, worked on the Manhattan Project and won the Nobel Prize. He's also a complete hoot. The book is a series of autobiographical stories -- pranks pulled as a student at MIT and at Los Alamos, teaching himself to paint, scientific discoveries he made, his three marriages, how he was rejected by the draft board for being mentally suspect (they asked him if he ever heard voices and he said yes he did and then went on to describe what he found interesting about that. He said that sometimes when falling in and out of sleep he'd imagine conversations with his foreign-born colleagues and the voices in his head spoke accurately with their accents -- but that if he tried to imitate such accents he could not do so at all. So how was it that one part of his brain had captured accents correctly but another hadn't? This was entirely typical of Feynman's wide ranging curiosity and intelligence, but the end result in this case was that the psychologists decided he was nuts. His colleagues at Cornell were vastly amused by this.)What I love about Feynman -- first of all, his great interest in everything and his willingness to experiment. The great joy he found in working things through (he said that the reason he'd never tried drugs, though he was tempted, was that he enjoyed thinking too much and didn't want to risk that.) Also, he's clearly so very intelligent and reading his book, his thoughts seem so easy to follow -- it makes the world of science seem accessible."
130,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,3,"There’s presumably a rule where only smart people are awarded Nobel Prizes in Physics. Richard Feynman was no exception. This memoir is filled with anecdotes from his childhood spent fixing radios, his experiences as a young man doing bomb research at Los Alamos up through his days as a renowned professor at Cal Tech. The central theme was always that this is one smart cookie. It was interesting to pick up on his thought processes. It probably didn’t feature as much pure science as most of his other books, but at least you could appreciate his intuition into the physical world’s biggest puzzles. Rather than emphasizing the technical details of physics, most of his stories were focused on his other interests and his geeky humor.While some of the stories were entertaining, and the lumens of candle power abounded, it didn’t always work for me. I kept getting the feeling that had the same stories been told in the third person, they would have been better – less egotistical sounding. In every one of his sidelines, he was masterful. It was like he was still driving home the point of how brilliant he was even when he was slumming it. After a while, I got tired of hearing how he became fluent in Portuguese when he taught in Brazil, or impressed the locals to no end with his distinctive style of bongo playing, or could dance like a professional, or got just about any woman he wanted to sleep with him. It was this last one that left the worst taste in my mouth. Some of his tales of attraction and conquest occurred when one of his wives was on her death bed. He was probably not as bad as I’ve made him sound. Like I said, we can certainly appreciate his intellect. He had a rare ability to explain difficult concepts in laymen’s terms, too. I got a confirmation of this a week after I finished the book when we were interviewing a former student of his from Cal Tech. He mentioned the “Feynman Effect”: a phenomenon whereby someone asking him a question got answered in such a clear and intuitive way that it was only later that they realized they still didn’t know exactly how it all tied to their existing understanding.So, count me as a fan of his scientific contributions and his ability to communicate, but not of his swagger. If it had all been a bit of a joke (you know, physicist … funny hair … limited social skills … but a would-be Lothario in spite of it), I would have laughed along with him, but I don’t think that was his intention. "
131,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/995651-nick,1,"One of the problems with reading a book written by a genius is that you have to ask yourself whether any perceived deficiencies in the text are due to the author, or due to your own failure to comprehend his brilliance. That said, I wasn't thrilled by this book. On a purely technical level, it would have benefited from a stronger editor. While there's a rough chronological order to the material, there tends to be a lot of jumping around both within and between the chapters. A few times, Feynman would relate some post-WWII anecdote, only to jump back to something that happened during his time at Los Alamos in the early 1940s. He'll mention that he divorced his second wife, and then shortly thereafter tell a story set during the marriage. It gives the book a very disjointed quality.On a more personal level, Feynman just doesn't strike me as someone you'd want to spend time with. About 30% of his stories talk about a time he pulled a fast one on somebody, or how he did something arrogant and obnoxious and it developed into an incident. Reading this book feels like babysitting a very rambunctious toddler--as amusing as his antics may be, you're can't help but looking forward to it being over. And while it's perhaps unfair to judge his behavior by modern standards, some of the womanizing and borderline misogyny (as when he decides that the best way to pick up women in bars is to treat them badly and call them whores) is a bit disappointing. Feynman's scientific accomplishments may be beyond reproach, but I doubt I'll spend any more time with his memoirs."

I'm a big sience fan, and I've always heard how brilliant and funny Richard Feynman was, especially because of his connection to the UofC. But I loathed this book. I suppose it's a memoir, and I don't know if it's ghost written or not, but what was supposed to endear me to Mr Feynman made him revolting to me. According to this book, he treated other people like dirt and thought it was hilarious, he correlated pure intelligence with worth, and he dismissed and disrespected everyone who he felt was not as intellectual as he was (and being that he was a genius, that was most of everybody). Perhaps this is melodramatic, but he sickened me a touch. His blatant disrespect for the work of other scholars in the guise of a patronizing outlook is wholly demoralizing, and for people who wished to pursue a degree in the sciences under him I can't even imagine what it was like to deal with his pomp and ego. I know that the persona displayed in memoirs is different than the actual personality of a person, but the gleeful manner in which he presents his attitude does nothing to disprove my issues with his style.

133,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,2,"The Nobel prize winning physicist, acclaimed drummer, artist, expert on Mayan astronomy, safecracker, prankster, etc, etc, tells “crazy adventures” of his life. They’re really not “crazy adventures,” these anecdotes; my own father's are easily just as rich and bizarre. Feynman came off to me as a somewhat unpleasant character: he was full to the brim of himself; his false modesty (“I’m too dim to realize when to keep my mouth shut, I just say what I think”) was cloying and annoying, as were his amazement at anyone else’s talent (a professional drummer is far better than him at the drums; this “shocks” him), his claims to understand nature better than artists, and his thinly-veiled put-downs of anyone even remotely concerned with the abstract. He was just the kind of jerk who, caught up in his criticism of others’ inability to grasp his broad points, never begins to wonder whether he is the one missing the gist. Also, his anecdotes are not fleshed out with context: who exactly are the people he’s talking to? When was this? I don’t care. In all, funny and interesting at times (at Los Alamos, on a committee to select school text books), but mainly kind of mundane."
134,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80479-peter-frazier,5,"This amusing little book of anecdotes had an alarmingly influential role in my life. It convinced me of the odd notion that it would be a good idea to go to Caltech and major in physics. In retrospect, this would have been a better idea had I been born around 1930 and was starting my scientific career around 1940, but nowadays it's a tough slog in physics, both money-wise and also discovery-wise. I think that people like Bohr and Planck and Einstein and Feynman discovered all the good stuff in physics and that future theory will be more difficult and less beautiful (though perhaps these string-theorists put my foot in my mouth). I wish I had realized all this when I was 17 rather than 24, but all is not lost: physics is wonderful training for all manner of mathematical disciplines, and all has worked out for the best. I retain a deep fondness for this book, and rereading old passages brings me comfort. If you ever have the choice between reading this book and doing something productive and worthwhile, I recommend that you read this book. All will work out for the best for you too."
135,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder,4,"Laugh out loud funny. My dad read this outloud to us when we were kids - I'm guessing at the exact year - and the whole family literally cried with laughter many times during the performance. Feyman's other memoirs are good too, but this is the funniest. I still think of it often. For instance, every time I use a combination lock, I think of his safe-cracking phase, and how it's every child's dream to learn how to crack safes and get at all that secret and valuable stuff. Which really sums up this book - Mr. Feyman approached life with the curiosity and glee of a small boy. He never lost that childlike sense of wonder or mischief.My only caveat - Mr. Feyman was quite the ladies' man, and there is a certain old-school misogyny in his style of writing about women. Looked at in the most charitable light possible, it's a reminder that he was human, as well as a genius physicist, and frankly, not always right. It doesn't make him any less of an amazing physicist, but it does remind us that he was mortal too.And after reading all of his memoirs, I began to suspect that his cavalier attitude towards women arose at least in part from his grief at the loss of his first wife, who died of cancer at a very young age (her early 20s, if I remember correctly), while he was busy working on the nuclear bomb in Los Alamos. She is the only woman he writes tenderly about - after that, the talk shifts to conquests and getting girls naked. His descriptions of his subsequent marriages lack the warmth of that first marriage, even if there is more fodder for humor. Something about it rings hollow even in Feyman's warm, humorous, self-deprecating voice. There is a real tragedy written between the lines here."
136,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2467151-elizabeth-k,2,"This was disappointing, because I've been wanting to read this for a while because he is so renown for being quite the hilarious character as well as a Nobel prize-winning physicist. This is a collection of essays that serves as a memoir; many are not directly related to physics, but that's definitely the theme. After reading this, my conclusion is that Feynman was mostly a world class knob. He lost me fairly early into it, when he described how you could see physics in action in the everyday world by messing with a waitress's tips. How very droll of you, Mr. Feynman. He is certainly quite the character in the same sense your annoying neighbor is quite the character, the kind who sees you unloading your groceries from the car and saunters over to give you pointless advice about his expert analysis on the best way to unload groceries without helping you, driving you to grit your teeth and nod as you flee toward your door because anything you might say in response, such as ""shut UP, annoying guy!"" would result in him saying ""Aw shucks, I can't help it that I'm smarter than you."" Many demerits for egregious overuse of the exclamation point.Grade: C-Recommended: Not really, although the essays set during his time at Los Alamos are somewhat interesting given the historical context. I suppose it's possible he really was charming and amusing in real life, but you wouldn't know it from his writing."

To follow your dreams, make them happen, make a living out of them, ultimately all this work to be of help for others and above all to enjoy life as you wish to - this is what I call to live your life to the fullest! Mr. Feynman stories are simply wonderful! They are not just funny - they present a man which desire to learn was his motto in life (he owes this desire to his father, a very remarkable man). According to him, anything can be learned as long as you wish for - so very true. If all pupils and students would have teachers like him, the world would be a much better place... I think the saying ""like father, like son"" emerged from their relationship. ;)Some called him corky; others arrogant - and maybe he was. But who are we to judge? I don't think it was easy for him to work on the atomic bomb project - the pressure, the implications... even brilliant minds need a getaway of some form. Maybe when we'll do the things he did we'll get to have a word on this matter. Until then, lets just admire his passion, his dedication and his work.The book does not contain scientific language, calculations or anything alike. Even if you're not interested in physics, this book is more than worth reading. Such a life experience not many can say they had...One more thing: I came across on below interview, produced by BBC in 1981, called The Pleasure Of Finding Things Out. 50 minutes length, worth every second of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgaw9... . It is a shorter version of his memoirs presented in the book and the following fragment is a part of it: People say to me, “Are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?” No I am not. I am just looking to find out more about the world. And if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law that explains everything so be it. That would be very nice discovery. If it turns out it’s like an onion with millions of layers and we just sick and tired of looking at the layers then that’s the way it is! But whatever way it comes out it’s nature, it’s there, and she’s going to come out the way she is.If you decide to put it on your to-read list, I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did :)"

He has been a hero of mine since I was very young, probably because my father also greatly admires him and spoke to me about Feynman and his unique personality from time to time.There are some great stories in this book and they will make you laugh out loud. Feynman was always so full of life and he was curious about absolutely everything from a very early age. He would always want to know, ""How does that work?"" or ""Why is that the way it is?"" or ""Is there another way to do that?"" He would also latch onto something and decide that he wanted to do it, and to do it really well. For example, witnessing the bongo-playing in Brazil inspired him to learn to play like that and not like some studio-taught purist. He achieved it through dedication to his objective and sheer passion.What made Feynman a genius? Well, there were lots of factors that contributed to his status, many of them discussed in other reviews of this book, but, my reason for putting him into that classification was that he was capable of explaining the most complex of matters to a five-year-old. That is TRUE genius.I have read this book many times. It is a short book and will remain amongst my collection until the day that I die. If you haven't read it already, you should. You really need to read this book. I can guarantee that it will change at least one aspect of your life!"

This is a captivating story of an amazing life that could not have been better had it been scripted at birth.Mr. Feynman has done it all. I loved the feeling of tagging along on this brilliant, Nobel-prize winning physicist’s life. A little eccentric yes, but the narrative flows in a very conversational manner (which is a style I like very much). From his early life, to his work on the atomic bomb, to his ability to crack safes, I could not help but admire his chutzpah and proven success. This ""nerd"" even had tremendous success with the ladies. Therefore, on behalf of nerds everywhere, you are our hero!He, like Robert Todd Lincoln, was always lucky enough to be at the right place at the right time in history. The difference is that Feynman tended to be around for the more auspicious historical events. Truly, there are not enough adjectives to describe his amazing talents, admirable life, and impressive success. Among the many biographies I’ve read, only one other person gets this summation, “Remarkable...a life well lived.” That person? Abigail Adams"
141,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,4,"This collection of stories was a tad bit uneven, but overall a helluva lot of fun! Feynman’s childlike curiosity and enthusiasm are infectious; he was a really likeable guy. With respect to math and science, Feynman made some excellent points about the dangers of rote memorization. People often mistakenly think that they’ve grasped something, but they’ve merely memorized facts rather than genuinely understood the thing conceptually. He also pointed out that with science, as with life in general, it is important to PLAY. We tend to lose sight of this far too often.As you’d expect, there is an abundance of humor in these anecdotes. My favorite funny part was when Feynman got into his first fight in a bar:
“One time I was in the men’s room of the bar and there was a guy at the urinal. He was kind of drunk, and said to me in a mean-sounding voice, ‘I don’t like your face. I think I’ll push it in.’I was scared green. I replied in an equally mean voice, ‘Get out of my way, or I’ll pee right through ya!’”
Best response ever."

An incredible life of one of the prodigious thinkers is summarized in less than 400 pages. I would not have put it down even if the book was 4000 pages long, so interesting is the story, a real page-turner.Apparently, by not taking life so seriously Dr. Feynman achieved some remarkably serious things which led to Nobel prize, and other remarkable accomplishments. How many other Nobel prize laureates have safe cracking as a hobby? The book is not just an entertaining story about an extraordinary life. The reader will find some invaluable wisdom about the essence of science, curiosity, creativity, teaching, science ethics, and life morals.I knew, believed, and always felt that curiosity is an essential ingredient of a purposeful life. Feynman, by his life, proved the point. For everybody seeking inspiration and curious about one of the most curious, and where it all might lead, this is a charming book which will probably be a jump-start to other Feynman’s books."

It’s obvious that they have a high functioning mind, which is the cause of such provocative mischievousness, and what follows next is what we already know, when they are constantly being told by their teachers! “You better use your mind to score good grades”.I think that’s the problem with our education system. It leaves no space for free thinking, it doesn’t let the students to think differently and to let them learn by experiments, by failed attempts, this is why most of us begin to lose interest in science because what we learn doesn’t really stay with us for a long time, since we don’t even understand the whys and hows behind the things!What makes a wind-up toy go? I thought, “I know what it is: They’re going to talk about mechanics, how the springs work inside the toy; about chemistry, how the engine of the automobile works; and biology, about how the muscles work.”If this makes you wonder why you never had a teacher who made you question everything and in turn made the process of learning interesting, then this book is for you! Professor Feynman (with his puzzle drive for discovering what’s the matter with things to figure out what to do to fix it) is the teacher you are looking for!This book is not an autobiography in its absolute sense, it’s rather a recollection of the adventures of a curious character which will give you a new world view to understand the genius behind a prankster and his indignant impatience with pretentious pompous fools and their hypocrisy.Its hilarious anecdotes (which are divided into wacky yet fascinating chapters) of fixing radio by thinking, stealing a door, learning biology with a map of a cat, fooling safecracker by safecracking, testing bloodhounds, not making decisions by refusing offers, receiving Nobel prize for the pleasure of discovering what he did, drawing and selling his beautiful artworks and learning to be an occasional jerk to women to get laid and playing with ants and bongo professionally, will surely hook you till the end.Like all smart people he might come across as a narcissist but if you have an admiration for geeky humour coupled with a razor-sharp wit and are curious enough to understand what sets his thought process apart from his brilliant peers, you might discover Feynman techniques to learn how to maintain an open but skeptical mind to look at things differently and your life will never be the same again!Following are the few things that I learned from this book, which I will never forget!You should have your passions – but also have some hobbies and strive to be extremely good at them by being really interested and keep on practising till you learn to do it fairly well, be attentive, use your own knowledge to try it differently from what is usually the practice. Learn from people around, don’t fear to experiment, gain new experiences, so that you have a story to tell, be notorious to exercise your brain but never hurt anyone. Be considerate and helpful! Learn how things work and to truly understand something, question why it is the way it is, what’s its use. Don’t memorize the definition of words and formulas but learn its application, learn with the help of examples and always make sure that the source of knowledge you are using is correct, always cross-check it by yourself. Learn what the rest of the world is like because the variety is always worthwhile."

Made me take interest in physics around us again. :)Feynman was surely a man of multiple lives, how could anybody live so much? Physicist, safe cracker, artist, frigideira (an instrument used in Samba music) player, nobel prize laureate, drummer, and more. His mischievous nature and varied interests (exploration of hypnotism and sense deprivation, e.g.) were inspiring in a way.As a scientist, he leaves out important messages primarily in the chapters: O Americano, Outra Vez! (later part, pg. 211 onwards, about state of science education in Brazil at the time); Is Electricity Fire? (on Jewish (dis)interest in science); Judging Books by their Covers (review of school math books, and disappointment obtained from them); and lastly, Cargo Cult Science, the last chapter.A must read for any science-loving person."

The rest of his science-related work as well as hobbies (drumming, painting, lock-picking, math duels, pranks, school book selection and more) can be preeety much summarized to..well, this picture:Feynman was definitely no bore. I love his way of everyday thinking: so practical, stripped of any tedious theorizing and philosophical blabber. Like in that part where he visits the biology department and find out that all the students memorize so many facts by heart when they could just look it up quickly. So I went to the librarian in the biology section and asked her if she could find me a map of the cat. ""A map of the cat, sir?"" she asked, horrified. ""You mean a zoological chart!"" From then on there were rumors about some dumb biology graduate student who was looking for a ""map of the cat.""  When it came time for me to give my talk on the subject, I started off by drawing an outline of the cat and began to name the various muscles. The other students in the class interrupt me: ""We know all that!"" ""Oh,"" I say, ""you do? Then no wonder I can catch up with you so fast after you had four years of biology."" They had wasted all their time memorizing stuff like that, when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes.""It's a really interesting, easy read - I really enjoyed this one, both in written and in audio form. And my most favourite part:  When I sat with the philosophers I listened to them discuss very seriously a book called Process and Reality by Whitehead. [...]First of all, I sat there without saying anything, which is almost unbelievable, but also true. A student gave a report on the chapter to be studied that week. In it Whitehead kept using the words ""essential object"" in a particular technical way that presumably he had defined, but that I didn't understand. After some discussion as to what ""essential object"" meant, the professor leading the seminar said something meant to clarify things and drew something that looked like lightning bolts on the blackboard. ""Mr. Feynman,"" he said, ""would you say an electron is an 'essential object'?"" Well, not I was in trouble. I admitted that I hadn't read the book, so I had no idea of what Whitehead meant by the phrase; I had only come to watch. ""But,"" I said, ""I'll try to answer the professor's question if you will first answer a question from me, so I can have a better idea of what 'essential object' means. Is a brick an essential object? [...] Then the answers came out. One man stood up and said, ""A brick as an individual, specific brick. THAT is what Whitehead means by an essential object."" Another man said ""No, it isn't the individual brick that is an essential object; it's the general character that all bricks have in common - their 'brickness' - that is the essential object."" Another guy got up and said, ""No, it's not in the bricks themselves. 'Essential object' means the idea in the mind that you get when you think of bricks."" Another guy got up, and another, and I tell you I have never heard such ingenious different ways of looking at a brick before.[image error]Now, did I mention the book gets hilarious at moments? :D Feynman was in Kyoto, trying to learn Japanese. So his lesson go like: One day he was teaching me the word for ""see."" ""All right,"" he said, ""You want to say, 'May I see your garden?' What do you say?"" I made up a sentence with the word that I just learned. ""No, no!"" he said. ""When you say to someone, ""Would you like to see my garden? you use the first 'see.' But when you want to see someone else's garden, you must use another 'see,' which is more polite."" ""Would you like to glance at my lousy garden?"" is essentially what you're saying in the first case, but when you want to look at the other fella's garden, you have to say something like, ""May I observe your gorgeous garden?"" So there's two different words you have to use.  Then he gave me another one: ""You go to a temple, and you want to look at the gardens..."" I made up a sentence, this time with the polite ""see."" ""No, no!"" he said. ""In the temple, the gardens are much more elegant. So you have to say something that would be equivalent to 'May I hang my eyes on your most exquisite gardens?'""*sigh* :'DI won't go into discussion of Feynman as a person outside of the science world. All I can conclude is that intelligence and morale do not have to coincide. Instead, I'll just troll the science a bit below :D brace yourself!"
147,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"This was a compilation of stories that Feynman tells from his own point of view. They were great. He seemed like a great guy. He was so full of life & had such an interest in it. From learning to pick locks, learn a different language, art, or music, he threw himself into the endeavor & did pretty well at it. I can appreciate that. He spent more time on these than he did on his work which is well documented elsewhere. I have Quantum Man: Richard Feynman's Life in Science in my queue, but I don't know when I'll get to it.He rarely had a bad word about anyone even when he was obviously disappointed in their choices. He sounds like a great teacher. He taught himself much (trig!) & I really liked the way he thought through problems, by building it in his head. I try to do that, but thought I was weird. I'll try harder from now on since I know I'm not. Many of the life lessons he passes along I've learned myself already, but they were still good ones.I'd heard he wasn't all that pleased with his Nobel Prize, but it was interesting to hear it from him. Considering what else he had said about his life to that point, it made a lot of sense.The bits on education were wonderful to listen to. I'd really liked to have had him as a teacher. I wish I could say I was shocked at the deplorable state of educational books that are being used on our children, but I was subject to them & so were my kids, so I know first hand. I can't say that the stupidity of the selection process surprised me either. The last section on how science should be performed & the standards it should be held to were great. It's especially important today when there is so much more to know, our technology has advanced so far, & is based on older methods. Several times lately, I've read articles that have stated facts that didn't add up to me. I've checked the studies they cited & found that they were 50 years old! No one has repeated the study in all that time?Great read & highly recommended."

The book doesn't go much into his physics but his experiences as a prankster and tinkerer and safecracker and adventurer as he goes from one episode to another. Interesting guy."
149,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33262643-titas-i-read-in-bed,5,"Physics is like sex!Today we will talk about a scientist who was an extraordinary man, known as a teacher, lover, master safe cracker (who stole papers of Manhattan Project), fan of Las Vegas’s strip clubs, exceptional liar, musician, artist and probably the most brilliant, influential, and iconoclastic figure in his field in the post-World War II era.How does one define a role model? A prodigy, hard-worker, achiever, winner in the field one is interested in, right? Well in that case the Nobel Prize winner theoretical Physicist Richard P. Feynman is a perfect candidate as role model to physicists. He was dangerously smart and an exceptional teacher. But underneath everything we generally know about him as a scientist, he had a curios and alarmingly mischievous mind that knew no boundaries.First let me just mention some of his works:During World War II Feynman was recruited to serve as a staff member of the U.S. atomic bomb project at Princeton University (1941-42). He was co-awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work. Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology.Enough with the facts already! Now lets talk about the wisdom he left behind!While stealing papers of Nuclear bombing, you should leave mysterious clues: Feynman was a master of desk wiping, lock picking and safe cracking. He even used to think about the mentality and psychology of the safe owner to crack faster. He once cracked three safes of Manhattan project and left certain clues as a mysterious mastermind. Why? Oh just for the fun of course!If you have to lie, lie with full confidence: It doesn’t matter if what you are saying is absolute truth or not. Even if you are unsure, don’t show it. Just go through it in full throttle judging the situation. Example- Feynman once got on stage and recited a jibrish with just the few words he knew in a foreign language. When one doubtfully asked if it was wrong, he replied that the man didn’t understand the depth of the recital!If you’re in Vegas and short in money, act as drunk friends of the strippers: I don’t even have the courage and experience to explain this one.Love what you do and do what you love: In his own words- “Physics is like sex: sure it may give some practical result, but that’s not why we do it.”Know yourself, find where you belong and embrace your faults: “I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.”“That’s the trouble with not being in your own field: You don’t take it seriously.”“All the time you’re saying to yourself, ‘I could do that, but I won’t,’–which is just another way of saying that you can’t.”And most important of all- don’t lie to yourself: “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”Even after being a dashing lover and romantic husband, Feynman was a phenomenal teacher (yes, this man was everything one wishes to be). His series of books 
The Feynman Lectures on Physics
 is perhaps the most popular physics book ever written which Nature described the book as having “simplicity, beauty, unity … presented with enthusiasm and insight”.Although he had experimented with LSD and Marijuana just because he was curious about the effects, he was was a damn fine fellow when it came to the meaning and purpose of life. To him the purpose was knowledge as he had described, “I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there.”A boy who knew how radios work, a student who invented his own mathematical symbols for better understanding, an undergraduate who stole a door, the only scientist who watched Atom Bomb test (Trinity test) without wearing glasses, and the only scientist ever who had asked a reporter if he can refuse the Nobel Prize because he didn’t like to answer too many phone calls – Mr. Feynman had lived a life that we live in 4 or 5 lives summed up together. Why? For the glory of knowledge of course! He was an unique personality beyond rules and paths.Thus like many many other students of physics, if I’m asked about my role model, it is none other than R. P. Feynman- a man who understood very very early that one should focus on understanding instead of just knowing things. Reading about all his life and life’s works one wonders what an honour it would have been to see him once face to face. The man who must have been the only one to appear in the world of Physics with such energy and brilliance.Read this semi-autobiographic book to experience something like never before.In his precious word, a person should live a life 
“where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.”

Richard Feynman was a genius with a super inquiring mind that is a hallmark of all great men, but what makes him so unique is that his life didn't just have one dimension. He was curious about so many fields and activities and the way he describes them in this book are so fantastic that you end up wanting to try those things out! "

152,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1224976-julie,1,"Nope, not wasting any more time on this clown. I read up through his chapter on how to neg a woman in order to trick her into sleeping with you and thought ""Yep, I am done. Gave this the good ol' college try but the bad outweighs the good here."" Who knew Feynman, as well as being a brilliant Nobel Prize winning physicist was also the patron saint of the PUA(Pick up artist) community?I am honestly shocked at the number of rave reviews this collection of personal anecdotes has. I assume people are blinded by Feynman's intellect - which was staggering - and his joyful attitude towards learning for learning's sake. Perhaps if I had read a biography of Feynman, written by someone else, I wouldn't have had such a negative reaction to him?It seemed obvious to me, both as a former SPED teacher and as the parent of someone on the autistic spectrum, that Feynman had undiagnosed Asperger's Syndrome. He often mentions his inability to understand social cues and to interact successfully with others. His story of using other people's nervous laughter as a clue that his behavior was incorrect was telling. He couldn't tell by unspoken body language or facial expressions or tone of voice - he needed actual tittering laughter to signal that he needed to adjust his behavior. Feynman used his prodigious intellect to help him work around his deficits in social behavior but often it wasn't enough.The first painful story was that of the waitress and the tip. Oh wow. Even when telling the story, years later, he has no idea how egregious his behavior was. He pulled the juvenile trick of leaving the tip as coins with a full glass of water on top. Two glasses with the coins split between them. Just what a busy server in a restaurant wants to deal with. To add insult to injury, this was a restaurant he went to daily & a waitress that often served him. This is how he repays her for doing a good job. His motivation for being a jerk? He wanted to see if she would be able to figure out how to get her tip without making a big mess, though how he would know this is unclear, since he wasn't there when she attempted it. He returns the next day to find everyone angry at him & the waitress refusing to interact with him anymore. She didn't have time for his intellectual query - since, you know, she had an actual job she needed to be doing - and the water spilled everywhere & that made extra work for her, cleaning his mess up, and then later she slipped & hurt herself on the still damp floor. Feynman has no clue that he has done anything wrong & can't figure out why people are upset. Then - get this - HE DOES IT AGAIN WITH THE NEW WAITRESS SERVING HIM. Hardy har har, ain't he a hoot?He tells many stories like this, where he is a complete asshole to people. He can't understand why people don't trust him and think he is a liar. One thing he enjoyed doing was pretending to be drunk when he wasn't - ugh, insert big eye roll here - because, I don't know honestly. Because he has no understanding of human emotions and common reactions?I stopped reading after the anecdote about how he is a nice guy but woman still won't have sex with him - can't they see how nice he is, damn it?! - so he meets a guy who teaches him the trick is to treat women like whores and bitches. "" I adopted the attitude that those girls are all bitches, that they aren't worth anything, and that all they're in there for is to get you to buy them a drink, and they're not going to give you a goddamn thing. I'm not going to be a gentleman to such worthless bitches and so on. I learned it till it was automatic.""A good reminder that just because someone is an intellectual genius or has an amazing artistic talent or incredible physical prowess doesn't make them a decent or even likable person. People tend to ascribe positive characteristics to successful people whether they are truly worthy of them or not. Feynman is a good example of this."
153,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,2,"The bits on doing physics are interesting; the bits on picking up aging tigers in shady New York bars, not so much.This book will likely appeal far more to science fanboys and groupies rather than scientists themselves. The goal of the book seems mostly to convince lay people that scientists are indeed human beings who have hobbies, eat at restaurants, and have sexual intercourse (gasp!). Given that most scientists likely see themselves as human beings, I think the majority of the book would be quite boring for them. I personally far prefer Feynman's nonfiction books and video lectures, which are served crystal-clear with a side of motivation.However, now that I've thoroughly demotivated your wanting to read this book, there are two upsides.First, to a baby scientist (a middle-schooler, high-schooler, or college freshman aspiring to become a scientist), especially one who doesn't come from a family of scientists or hasn't met many in their life, this book is a much more inspirational look at the life of an (atypical) scientist than the Wikipedia entry on scientist. That said, if you know a youngling leaning towards a life scientific, this is a great (dangerous?) book to pass along to them.Second, hidden amongst the fluff are stellar pieces of advice for doing science, what I will refer to as ""Feynmanisms."" Most aren't explicit but are simply what I interpreted from Feynman's stories on doing science. Here's a list of my favorites:Seek people and ideas outside your own field. There's a great pressure in science to confine yourself to one field. This pressure comes from funding agencies and administrators who must be able to easily define which discipline your work is in, as well as from interactions with other scientists in your field, who will of course mostly suggest ideas and insights from within that field. Resist this pressure. Speak with scientists in either fields about their ideas and your own. Seek connections. It will often be hard to communicate but its always worth the effort.Don't be afraid to ask questions. Many a student or scientist finds himself at the end of a long lecture, completely lost because he didn't have the courage to ask what a word on the second slide meant. Get over it. You are and will always be a student and there will always be things you don't know.Think in examples. It's easy to get lost if you think about every new concept you learn in terms of another new concept you only learned ten minutes ago. Yet this is often the way books try to teach. Instead, when trying to follow an explanation, think in a concrete example and add features slowly. It might be ""faster"" to use jargon and buzzwords to explain a concept, but there's no use in this compression if you don't understand what's going on.Don't fool yourself into thinking you know something you don't. It is surprisingly easy to convince the human brain that it understands something that it most certainly does not. Knowing the name of something is not the same as understanding what it is. Throwing around buzzwords is an easy way to fake understanding to others, but it's impossible to be creative or have any fun if all you can do is mix and match buzzwords.Never stop playing. Remember why you enjoyed physics (or whichever field) in the first place; it's fun to play with ideas! No administrator or scientific colleague is ever going to ask you to spend more time playing, but that is often crucial to coming up with new ideas as well as having fun."
154,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,5,I really enjoyed this book and learning about this man. Just the kind of guy one would love to have as a friend. Such curiosity. Such lack of pretension! Marvelously enjoyable book. 
155,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"A while back, I read another book by Feynman, The Pleasure of Finding Things Out, and I wasn't all that thrilled with it. It was kind of disappointing at the time. I knew that Feynman's fame came not only from his scientific brilliance, but from the fact that he was a genuinely interesting, funny and mischievous person. I had hoped that I could find some of that in the book, but to no avail. And so I gave it away so that someone else could get the pleasure from it that I could not.Still, I was not completely turned off Feynman. There are videos of him around the internet that really show his vibrancy, his energy and the passion with which he approached the world, and I knew there would come a time when I would have to give him a second chance. Thus, this book.Surely You're Joking, Mister Feynman! is the story - or rather a collection of stories - about what can happen to a person with immense confidence in his own abilities, an insatiable curiosity about the world, a willingness to make mistakes, all topped off with a generous helping of genius.First, as Feynman calls them at the beginning of the book, some vitals. Richard Feynman was a theoretical physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project, taught at Caltech, and won the Nobel Prize in physics for his contributions to quantum electrodynamics. He was also one hell of a bongo player, an accomplished artist, and a self-taught safecracker. He was a joker and a prankster and a ladies' man who could bluff his way into pretty much anything he wanted to do, and was often surprised that people believed his bravado. He had a passion for mysteries and puzzles and figuring out how things worked, from combination locks to the movements of electrons to why water curves the way it does when it comes out the tap, and he didn't give a good goddamn about what the rest of the world thought of him.In other words, Richard Feynman was a pretty awesome guy.This book is a collection of Feynman's stories, the kind that he might tell at a party or with a bunch of friends traveling. They're the variety of story that might begin with, ""Did I ever tell you how I joined a samba band in Rio?"" and just go on from there. He starts with his youth, how he was the kind of boy who just loved to tinker with things. He would take electronics apart and put them back together, and then go to junk shops to buy parts that he could build into better radios. He did experiments with ants to find out how they communicated, and dedicated himself so hard to solving puzzles that eventually all he needed was the first line, and he could immediately come back with, ""He starts by chopping every other one in three parts.""He was one of those kids whose curiosity was boundless, and who never even imagined that there was anything ""better"" he could have been doing than exploring how the world worked. I couldn't shake the feeling that if young Feynman were around today, he'd be medicated to the eyeballs just to stop him being so ""weird."" But you know me. Cynic.We follow him through his days at MIT, pulling pranks with friends and discovering those interesting weaknesses in human thought processes that allowed him to get away with murder when he was young. His habits of wondering how things work carried him through his participation in the Manhattan Project, his travels to countries like Brazil and Japan, and led him through a life that was never without fascinating and entertaining discoveries.Long story short (too late), Feynman is - or at least should be - a model for young people today. While the book isn't pitched towards young people, there are several lessons in it that should be taught to every child.The first is that the world is infinitely interesting. Any kid who whines that she is bored needs to be shown the million and one ways that you can combat boredom just within a ten-foot radius of where you're sitting. Look at something - anything and ask yourself, ""I wonder how that works,"" and then go find out. The possibilities are endless, and the potential exists that you may discover a passion you never knew you had. Feynman didn't start out wondering how electrons work - he fixed his neighbors' radios just because he could. One thing led to another, and next thing you know - BAM! Nobel Prize.The second point, and it is connected to the first, is to never say No. In his essay, ""But Is It Art?"" he talks about how he learned to draw. It started when an artist friend offered to teach Feynman how to draw if he would teach the artist about science. While Feynman believed that he would be an absolutely atrocious artist, he still agreed to the challenge, and he stuck with it. Eventually he became well-known as a decent artist, even managing to sell some of his works. Now obviously, there are limits and caveats to ""never"" - there are times when saying No is the right thing to do. But when you find an opportunity to expand your abilities, to learn new things and face new challenges, the automatic ""No"" may deprive you of a joy that you never knew you could experience.Third, you must know who you are. One of the problems inherent in living in a society is that there's always someone trying to tell you who you are, or at least who you should be. Your parents, teachers, friends, all have an image of you in their heads, and are all trying to mold you into that image, consciously or unconsciously. Add to that the government, media, corporations, advertisements, shysters, preachers and other deliverers of hokum and propaganda who are also trying to tell you who you really are, despite having never met you and being pretty sure that you don't already know yourself. And many people, sadly, don't. But Feynman did. He knew who he was, and that was all he needed. He occasionally let people think differently about him, but the thread that runs through this book is a rock-solid self-awareness that allowed him the self-confidence to pick up showgirls or try to turn down a Nobel Prize.The caveat to this, and a corollary to the second point, is that you can always discover new things about who you are. All through the book, we see Feynman faced with a new opportunity that he thinks he can't do because it's just Not Him. Drawing, playing music, learning languages - those skills didn't fit into the mental model of who he thought he was, a flaw that all of us possess. A lot of us, without even giving it a try, might immediately discard something by saying, ""Well, that's just not me."" Maybe it could be. It takes courage, and the willingness to fall flat on your face, but if you can discover a new talent or a new passion, isn't it worth it?Finally, remember that everyone else around you is just as human as you are. Don't be impressed by titles and uniforms, fancy suits and impressive business cards. Don't assume that just because someone wears a soldier's uniform or a thousand dollar suit that they are somehow ""better"" than you. Feynman not only resisted authority in so many of these tales, he actively worked to subvert it. Whether it's trying to sneak codes past military censors or breaking into the safe that held all the secrets of the atomic bomb, he never let a title get in the way of learning or growing.One of my favorite Feynman stories related to this last point isn't actually in this book, but I'll mention it anyway. After the Challenger disaster back in 1986, NASA was called on the carpet to explain to Congress why their shiny new space shuttle went Kaboom. The NASA managers went on and on about the O-rings, filling their talk with supercilious jargon and doublespeak, hoping that their haughty attitudes and impenetrable explanations of why the cold weather made the O-rings fail would be comprehensible enough to satisfy the committee, yet obtuse enough to avoid actually admitting that they had done anything wrong. While they were doing this, Feynman put a piece of the O-ring material into a glass of ice water and let it sit there for a while. Then he took it out, stretched it, and showed that it had lost the pliability that it needed to do its job. With a simple demonstration, he not only showed the fault that led to the Challenger explosion, but at the same time put a bunch of self-aggrandizing stuffed shirts in their places.I love that story.Anyway, if you're looking for a Feynman book to read - and who isn't? - this is the one to start with. There's not much hard talk about science in it, just lots of stories about a really interesting guy. Even if it doesn't make you want to get into quantum electrodynamic theory, I hope it still makes you look at the world in a different way."
156,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93868753-rubel-rana,5,"One of the most beautiful minds in the history of human race was talking to me like a 12 years old boy with full of ebullience.

I didn't even expect that His life round efflorescence beautiful brain and who himself was a harbinger who had knowledge of past also could be this hilarious and this down to earth. I laughed and got astonished that how easily and in a lilt way he handled in the real time and later discussed it in this book of all those imbroglios.Anyway I never write reviews of books, I just simply share my feelings. This was no way more than that. I wish time travel was possible so that I could meet Einstein, Feynman, Carl Sagan, Marie Curie And the love of my life Audrey Hepburn.

157,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5014554-jack,5,"I found myself unable to make fair judgement about: Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a Curious Character. One day I gave it three stars and another five. I should think that it certainly deserves five stars in that it is one of the few books that delve into the mind of a genius and gives some idea to their thought process's. My desire to write a review of this book are threefold:I was stationed in Orlando Florida and it was mandatory that we watch the liftoff's.After the Challenger shuttle disaster I worked for a woman who did quality assurance for repairs on US Polaris ballistic missile systems who worked with the same seals that failed on the shuttle disaster. Long before the results were published by the investigation team she met Mr. Feynman on a flight to duty stations. In their exchange he asked her what she thought was the problem and told him without a doubt it was the seals. Reagan the president at the time this disaster had exerted pressure to launch the Challenger in the overly cold weather. I also watched the media's involvement and unneeded sensationalism about the delays that undoubtedly provoked a too hasty decision to launch. I have read many management studies attributing this debacle as a legacy of the decision making process called Groupthink. As this can only be so and knowledge of the affects of cold on the seals was widely know in professional circles and also at NASA it must be surmised that we have a warped decision making system in place in our government.The lightness that Feynman's stories give to the seriousness of his academic career must only be surmised as a way of dealing with his knowledge of how many problems the Earth is facing in part due to our faulty decision making. It was driven home after watching a video about his life where I was almost brought to tears... The must see video is The Quest For Tannu Tuva[1988] which seemed to be more widely shown in the UK than in the US.Let's learn from Feynman."
158,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68153-maura,2,"this turned into a book i was racing thru just so it would be over. it's not that it's bad. it's essentially a compendium of all the stories Feynman could tell during a dinner party. and the stories are well told, and there's many amusing bits in them. but, you see, i didn't end up liking him. and in real life, i would have probably been amused by him at the first party, only spent a short time with him at the 2nd party, and then spent any further parties making sure i was in another part of the room. his ego, it's just too big. and he spends way too much time talking down his accomplishments only to build himself up even higher than when he started, often at the expense of someone else.all that said, i suspect he would have been a good professor to have [he's good with the concrete examples of the few physics problems he mentions in this book], and if i run across some of his collected physics lectures, i would probably read them and learn a lot."
159,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2758455-katy,4,"A nice collection of stories from the life of Dr. Feynman. Not only was he a Nobel Prize winning physicist, but also truly a man who loved learning and was curious of most things."
160,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,1,"I totally agree with Emily, the top reviewer with 113 comments, most of them chastising her for not loving this book, and many of them trying to imply she's simply not smart enough to appreciate Feynman if she doesn't love it. Without attempting to demean or diminish Feynman's actual brilliance and greatness as a scientist, I declare: this book is annoying as shit. Without dismissing the many very real talents Mr. Feynman had, I'm not convinced that compelling and empathetic writing was one of them. I'm aware this book is little more than a compilation of interviews with Feynman, so perhaps the blame there lies with his co-author/editor, who took Feynman too much at his literal word and failed to effectively work the many anecdotes into a pleasing and well-written whole. I'm told Feynman was a very likeable guy, but the guy who comes across in these anecdotes seems to me to be only likeable in small doses. He seems bombastic, overbearing, even a bit grandiose in his manner, despite paying lip service to modesty – and by this, I don't just mean he spends too much time bragging about how clever he is, which he also does. Don't bother dinging me for saying this by pointing out that he IS pretty goddamn clever and has earned some bragging rights - I'm aware of that, and I don't care. He could be the smartest person in the history of the world, but braggadocio is still not an attractive habit. And don't try to tell me it's an essential quality of an autobiography, either. I've read other autobiographies where people spend upward of 300 pages talking about themselves without making me want to punt them.No, I sense something deeper in Feynman's manner of speaking that says to me, This person is utterly arrogant and yes, self-aggrandizing. (Emily's word.) It strikes me as the sound of someone who's spent too much of his life with his fanboys hanging on his every word, so that now he thinks every word that comes out of his mouth is actually worth hanging on. This may be a justifiable mistake for someone in Feynman's position, but that doesn't make it any less a mistake. In fact, I think it's a mistake that is at the heart of this book – the concept of, “It's Feynman, so of COURSE we can just compile a bunch of interviews with him about random shit he did one time, put them in chronological order, and it'll be great!”And I don't find Feynman nearly as funny, endearing, or even interesting as he thinks he is. To be fair, I admit he seems from afar like a terribly interesting man, but I quickly discovered I do NOT want to spend 11 solid hours listening to him tell seemingly random and generally trivial stories about episodes in his life. One or two anecdotes may be mildly entertaining, but his style gets old in a hurry, and his sense of humor seems downright mean-spirited at times. Perhaps my mistake was in attempting to vread it straight through – I don't really have any other way to vread. But you can only vread so many anecdotes about experimenting with ants and their pheromone trails or working on broken radios as a kid before you realize each one may be slightly interesting, but when you put them all together in a row, their total interest value doesn't accumulate. Meanwhile, Feynman's annoyance value DOES. Therefore, I recommend this book (a) in small doses, say for example as light bedtime reading, or (b) for those on the “Feynman can do no wrong” bandwagon. This latter group is his true audience – the ones who are delighted to hang on every word that comes out of his mouth. And I suspect that in the latter half of his life, he moved through a world so surrounded by those people that he forgot there was anything else. I could be wrong – maybe it's not Feynman's fault at all, and this isn't really him. This could be just the aspect of him that's been asked to sit down in front of a microphone and tell every story about himself that he can think of. When your friends tell you that your war stories are so awesome they should be compiled and published as a book, is there any other way it can really come out?Audio notes: The audio version is not helped by a narrator who seems to be sort of channeling Feynman's manner of speaking – his rhythms and intonations, though not his accent or timbre – and it makes a slightly annoying series of anecdotes that much MORE annoying and somewhat duller than the material itself would warrant. I pulled up recordings of Feynman's lectures and more casual interviews, and there's enough of a match to his casual speech patterns that I think it's intentional. But it's as though the narrator learned to imitate Feynman by listening to him speak a single sentence, and then he just repeats that sentence over and over. Every sentence has the exact same rhythm and intonation as the one before it, and it's all a little too fast and perky, so it's like being forced to spend 11 hours listening to a salesman's patter. Somewhere between that and Chinese water torture."
161,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3764819-barb,2,"The subtitle of this book is ""Adventures of a Curious Character."" I would definitely say that Richard Feynman is curious--the probably one thing I liked about him was his interest is exploring the world beyond just the physics he specialized in. He worked with biologists when he could've worked with physicists; he tried out deprivation tanks. He pushed himself to learn new languages and paint and get out of his comfort zone. That's admirable.However. The man was insufferable. This book, which is largely a series of stories he told to a friend in a very informal manner, is anecdote after anecdote of him saying, essentially, how much better he was than others. How his was the right way of thinking. He would try to be self-deprecating, but it inevitably wound up as ""But it turned out I was the most awesome!"" Stories tended to go something like, ""Some really smart people were talking about something. I'm such an idiot, and didn't know anything about that topic, but threw out an idea that sprang to mind, because I'm too stupid not to say whatever I'm thinking. And then they lit up! 'What a great idea!' they said. It was really just luck that it happened that way."" Repeat ad infinitum. Some of his stories from his childhood were interesting--and the book is probably best read in brief snippets, so the ego doesn't overwhelm you. But he lost me when relaying the story of putting a waitress's tip under an upside-down full glass of water. And he remained proud of himself for that. The man was not nice. He wasn't a good guy. He didn't feel the need to contribute to the common good. He had zero problems making others' lives miserable, like when he agreed to give a class at a local college, provided he only had to fill out so many forms. Turned out, it required one more form than originally agreed-upon, but instead of just signing it, he made the poor college employee go to what Feynman himself describes as a lot of trouble just to not fill out the form. And he refused to submit receipts for reimbursement (though at least there he accepted that that meant he wouldn't get the money).This isn't even getting into his stories about women.The book wasn't all bad. Like I said, Feynman had some redeeming qualities. He's someone who would be interesting to chat with for a few minutes at a party. But ultimately, as good as he may have been at science and as many interesting stories he may have had, Dick Feynman is not someone I want to spend more time with."
162,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67794375-david,3,"Richard Feynman understood physics. His reader, the cerebral and equally pulchritudinous, david, knows not a thing about physics. Okay, that is not true. “Things fall when you drop them,” I have observed, time and again. Therefore, I have an aptitude for science.I can relate.This guy won a Nobel Prize, hung with Einstein and Oppenheimer, and discovered and documented events that I do not feel like sharing, mostly because I cannot.I, unlike Feynman, garnered a trophy in wrestling. An unusual one. I was one of the few kids on any high school grappling team to have viewed the ceilings of each tournament visited (that is not a good thing in this sport). And it was not by design, but by ambivalence. If at first, you do not succeed, no one really cares. I did not know any scientists, but I did occasion ‘Feinstein & Schloppenheimer’s Deli.’ Ah, the pastrami on rye, you could just die, literally. And still, like every solid American who has learned not to enjoy anything ‘too much,’ I ripened into a vegan decades ago. Go figure. Please pass the Kombucha.A very interesting story, this was. Feynman had his tale to tell and it was atypical. He was one of the architects in the development of the nuclear bomb and was an instructor and/or a student at MIT, Caltech, Cornell, and other top schools. His take on academia for a lifetime, with a IQ that could travel the autobahn but not I-80, makes for some funny moments.He had the corny sense of humor you would expect from a full-time scientist. And much of it made for an enjoyable read, although I go deaf when it comes to jokes that include numbers.So, in conclusion, I would like to thank the members of the Academy, my school teachers who assuaged my youth with ‘C’s rather than ‘F’s and the good people of the Seychelles. Pax vobiscum and give my regards to Broadway."

Very natural, very rich, inspiring and, well, what I enjoyed the most of course, his views of life felt often times aligned with mine, so what's not to love about that? :PThis is a man who knew how to live and how to find beauty in everything he did. His strong curiosity is what makes a difference between a great person who can create whatever he sets his mind on doing, and a random person who simply knows facts about art/science/news but can't use them to create or really understand anything whatsoever.The book is funny and clever. I absolutely loved it and will surely read it again at some point in my life!Here are some quotes that I really connected with:""And, just like it should in all stories about philosophers, it ended up in complete chaos.""""There were a lot of fools at the conference - pompous fools - and pompous fools drive me up the wall. Ordinary fools are all right; you can talk to them, and try to help them out.

He was very curious. He was curious in almost all the area and he picked at them so quick especially in arts! He was good at arts and music.I also like the part where he talked about ants. He redirect the ants’ route. When I was young, my sister and I did a bit experiment about ants too! I would say he is mischievous at the offices. Messing around with people about safe! I want to hear more about his colleagues point of view too.  He reminds me of Forrest Gump. Both of them were so curious about everything and good at whatever they put foot in it. Here are a few quotes that I like from the book. The last one was from the speech from Caltech commencement in 1974. ‘Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that’s the end of you.’ ‘The first principle is that you must not fool yourself- and you are the easiest person to fool.’ ‘So I have just one wish for you- the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of Inter gritty I have described, and and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.’ The only thing I don’t like about him is his involvement of Manhattan Project. "
165,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/436784-leippya,5,"A fascinating read, and also surprisingly hilarious! I didn't expect to burst out laughing while reading the autobiography of a physicist but that's what ended up happening -- Feynman definitely was a first class prankster! Although physics are often mentioned, you don't need to really know about it to be able to enjoy the book; this is more about his life than his work. It's a joy to read about how much this man enjoys learning, not only physics but also music (bongo player!), painting and so on. Makes you just want to learn those things you've been postponing for a while. I cringed a bit at the way most women are represented in the book, but if that's how the women he met really were, there's nothing really to do about it, you can't rewrite history.I would really advise everybody to read this book. Feynman is a Nobel Prize winner, worked on the atomic bomb and is such an interesting and funny person to read about. Really, what I'm going to remember most from this book is how thoroughly that guy enjoyed life and embraced any challenge he set his mind on."
166,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2646348-natalie,5,"This should be made compulsory in school. At a very basic level as a collection of humorous anecdotes and zany adventures, it already deserves 5 stars, but it is so much more than just a funny book. There is plenty of serious insight and we are so fortunate to have a glimpse into Feynman's ingenious childlike mind. Reading it brings me real comfort to know I'm on the right track - that it's right to remain intellectually curious, that there's fun in learning, that you should always go back to first principles, and that you should never lose any intellectual integrity. So it is baffling and disheartening to see some bad reviews. To anyone who sees this book as self-aggrandizing, you're completely missing the point and I hope you stay a rare breed. But I'm open to hearing you out and I would be grateful if you could share your reasons because I'm just not seeing it at all. My only regret is that I didn't read this sooner, but better late than never. "
167,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5547564-david,5,"Simply put: To date, it is the most thoroughly enjoyable memoir I have ever read! I love Feynman's accounts of his life, of his interminable curiosity, of his brilliance, of his determination to never say ""I can't do this"" and keep at it until he learned, whether it was physics (for which he won the Nobel Prize), learning Portugese, learning to draw, learning to socialize in a bar, learning drums. So inspirational and full of Feynman's very humorous wit throughout. I loved every minute of this!! For audiobook listeners, Raymond Todd absolutely nails the correct tone!"
168,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14875421-anna,5,"It's one of those books after which you think: WHAT? I can only give 5 stars to it?And then you think you should give every other book less stars, because they are not as awesome as this one.And THEN you think about the inspiring character this book is about and that he is such a positive person and never would give other people get less, just because he is so awesome. And then you are just sad that the book is over and thankful that you could read it : ) "
169,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27248823-vishal,5,"How much do you think a person can do in a single lifetime despite having a dedicated attachment to the ever-demanding(and boring, according to laypeople) field of Theoretical Physics?He can learn to make good enough paintings to be shown in an one-man exhibition. He can learn to play Bongo well enough to be included in street competition in pre-carnival seasons in a city of Brazil. He can play drums for a Ballet which would win a national level award. He can learn to crack safes and pick locks which would give him a reputation all over his work arena. He can make reliable observations and conclusions by practicing hallucination, analyzing dreams by falling in and out of sleep, by making an experiment on ants and showing their lack of sense of geometry. He can learn many languages. He can get drunk every now and then in bars and pick up girls. He can stop drinking at once when he wishes to. Despite all of this, he can still win a Nobel Prize.Richard Feynman, the coolest Physicist ever, shows you the vast array of possibilities to consider and explore if you begin with a child-like curiousity about the world and don't let it fade away with passing years of your life. Before reading this book, I was little apprehensive about what I am supposed to do in life if I like so many things and am afraid to pick up one because I don't want losing my other fields of interest. So one of the greatest teachers, Feynman, showed me the way that if you remain curious and manage your time, you can pursue whatever you want.This book of anecdotes might seem a little exaggerating and annoying to some people, who altogether miss the idea of the lessons the author is trying to propagate. One of the reviews on Goodreads says that, the book is full of arrogance and how Feynman is showing off his skills at so many things and taking pride in himself. I pity the poor reviewer who missed the point that how Feynman is not showing that ""I could do it"", he is showing that ""it can be done by you too"". So much rant for the ignorant laypeople.Inspite of the anecdotes about Feynman ""having fun"", the most important parts of this book to be circulated and popularized are his views on pseudo-science and scientific integrity. He experimented with much of pseudo-science including psychics, hallucinations and dream-interpretations and explained the scientific side of those phenomena. He explained how ignorant people are fooled by the practitioners of pseudo-science. About his remarks on scientific integrity, it is a must read for anyone who wishes to pursue science, and it should be read by laypeople too so that they could see how science works and why is it preferable to any cult of faith believe system. He explains the importance of experiments and shows you to be patient with them in the part about his experiments on ants.""You are not obliged to be what others expect you ought to be. If you don't be what they want you to be, it's a failing of their judgement, not your own."" A quote that could be misinterpreted too, but it would be clear when one knows the context in which Feynman said those words. After the death of his first wife and returning from the Nuclear bomb project, he was depressed and had a sense of loss of his zeal for Physics. He was teaching Physics but he didn't think he was making enough contribution to research according to what was expected of him. That's when he explains how he stopped caring and started to play with Science for the love of it. He started with a trivial experiment of analyzing spinning plates and this lead to the ideas in Quantam Physics which later won him the Nobel Prize. The story of recovering is impressive and inspiring, if my elaborations here don't make a convincing case for it then I suggest you to take my word for it and read the part.In conclusion, this is one of the books which you can include in your list of 'Life-changing books'. You can read it again and again, everytime you'll learn something new. Everytime the book will offer a new perspective onto life. Everytime, you'll see how to live a life that is full of Life. "

Incredible passion to science and asking simple question 'why' on all the surrounding things. The relation to the system of education and science in the world of memorising the facts and past discoveries can be summarised in the following quote: ""I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something"""
171,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"It seems only natural to begin my thoughts on this book with a quote from Feynman :The first principle is that you must not fool yourself. And you are the easiest person to fool. These words capture the essence of what formed Feynman's portrait. Someone who questioned all the established notions and believed in science to be ultimately a trial and error method to arrive at the truth. His is a first rate scientific mind that never stops at anything unless he arrives at a conclusion that is satisfying and in accordance with common sense. What makes him different is the fact that he does not stop here but goes one step further to ensure that he does communicate this in the most simplest fashion possible. It is a book long glimpse to the mind of a funny, intelligent and humane persona that made up Richard Feynman.What strikes you most about him is his utter lack of pretension. For a man who won a Nobel, worked on the Manhattan project and has a string of achievements in the field of physics to his credit, he is entirely unassuming. He assumes the same air of fun and gaiety in discussing the Manhattan project as he does on how to flirt with the showgirls in Vegas. This is a no holds barred account of his life and a detailed elucidation on some of his thoughts and perspectives. If I was asked to pick what stood out of this book, I would pick the attribute of curiosity. You do not need a sharp mind to pick out the number of times he tinkers around to find the underlying truths all because it got him curious. The second aspect is that he never shied away from learning all through his life. From what I can recollect right now, he went along and studied how to make music at a Brazilian Carnival, how to gamble like a high roller, how to play bongo drums, how to be interesting to women without emptying your pocket in the process and so on. If you look at these things he learned, they have nothing to do with science but that never stopped him. All that mattered to him was the learning and how to be good at what you learn. It baffled me to see that he could manage to learn so much in one single lifetime. Feynman was never the highbrow kind to spurn all these as beneath him but he embraced all these as the little things that make our World fun to live in. Feynman was above everything else an epitome of irreverence. Social niceties never sat well with him and he was the kind to call a spade its real name, in the loudest way possible no matter what the occasion was . Bureaucracy was what suffered his wrath the most through pranks and vociferous protests. Here is what he had to say about the ruling elite and its policies :  I know it is the way the Government works ; well screw the Government ! I feel that human beings should treat human beings like human beings. And unless I am treated like one, I'm not going to have anything to do with them.  These acts of rebelliousness chose to make him a kind of social pariah, but Feynman being Feynman cared not two hoots about it !This is no biography but an exploration of things that caught his interest from everything ranging from Mayan hieroglyphics and quarks to hallucinations and good looking girls. A very interesting set of anecdotes about a rather unique human being. Recommended. "
172,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"The Most Fascinating ManI just met the most fascinating man in my life – just finished reading “Surely You Must be Joking Mr. Feynman”. Here is a man who is probably one of the brightest that ever walked on this planet. A person who was relentlessly curious, and not just about his own craft, but about almost everything he encountered. An incredibly mischievous person who took nothing very seriously, but at the same time took everything seriously enough to explore passionately. Feynman was obsessed with solving problems, and not just in Physics but anything that he took interest in, and that’s a very large universe from machines to drumming, from school education to picking up women in a bar, from art to Mayan hieroglyphics. Above all, he was a man who was irreverent towards all ideas until it made complete sense to him.What bothered Feynman the most was people’s lack of deep understanding of what they believe they understand. Most of us believe we understand a few things, especially things that relate to our professions, but do we really? Most of us have a very superficial sense of things that we know, which may be adequate to waddle through our jobs and our life, but the kind of deep understanding that Feynman is referring to, where everything fits together and makes perfect sense, where one is capable of explaining to another individual with perfect clarity, is mostly missing. Even more dangerous is that fact that most of us are not even aware how muddled our understandings are. Most of us, as individuals, and sometimes entire professions, suffer from this grand illusion without ever being challenged.I wish I read this book many decades earlier, because there was a possibility that it could have changed my life. I believe it should be a must-read for all young people, especially those that plan to take up a scientific, or for that matter, any intellectual profession. Looking back at my childhood, I had very similar curiosities as Feynman, and like him I spent most of my time tinkering with things and exploring everything from fire to ants and from machines to questions like why we find something musical. However, I was not even nearly as smart, but more importantly, I did not have his perseverance. Many of us are curious when we are young, but intellectual laziness prevents us from exploring them adequately. Most of us also lack the spirit to challenge all ideas that came from authority sources. To Feynman, every idea had to make perfect sense to him, and until then he simply would not accept them. I, on the other hand, grew up with values that tried to convince me that having some “beliefs” is a virtue. These beliefs did not come as religious or social dictates but more as moral and political wisdom, and I convinced my young mind that I am making perfectly rational choices. The funny thing is, if you asked me when I was in my teens or twenties. I would have proclaimed the same mindset that Feynman had, except I really did not practice it. What a remarkable human being – almost unbelievable! I have never met or seen Feynman. Once I stood just outside his office door in CalTech. I have been extremely lucky to have met and spent time with his close friend and colleague Murray Gell-Mann, who is often mentioned in this book. Another astounding mind…"
173,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31318644-ankit-kumar,5,"Well, another autobiographical book which I loved very much. This time it is from a visionary whom I have admired for a long time, without knowing much about his work and life. This book gives a such an honest account of the life of Feynman, that too by himself. You will never read a better book by someone like this. The title of the book does full justice to the material inside the book, right from the first page. Feynman pens down all of his adventures in life which revolves around his passion- ""Physics"". And other stuff that he learned and talked because he was curious about them. He was a person, who will not accept something just by hearing it or just by looking at it from face value, He would go great length to understand the reason behind them, by himself. After much thought and deliberation, he will accept it with full integrity and fight for it, or reject it forthright and will continue to do so without fearing the consequences. There is so much to learn from the character of Feynman. I cannot do justice by writing about that in this review, but you ought to read it and understand it and feel it yourself. Do read this book, you will have so much fun reading about his adventures and also sound reasons behind them. This book has so many complex concepts, phenomena are discussed with such humility and simplicity, and without any pretence that only Feynman could have (or I have read till date about in a person). The last few paragraphs of the book, in which Feynman gives advice about how to maintain integrity in scientific pursuit by anyone, and take full responsibility of what you are doing and why you are doing so, particularly given me so much to think about my own practice and future in science. I would like to finish this review by quoting Feynman, from this book, which I found very inspirational and something which we should think about all the time in our lives. "" You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.""~ Richard P. Feynman(Surely you're joking Mr Feynman)"
174,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3989689-asails-f,5,"I found myself unable to make fair judgement about: Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a Curious Character. One day I gave it three stars and another five. I should think that it certainly deserves five stars in that it is one of the few books that delve into the mind of a genius and gives some idea to their thought process's. My desire to write a review of this book are threefold:I was stationed in Orlando Florida and it was mandatory that we watch the liftoff's.After the Challenger shuttle disaster I worked for a woman who did quality assurance for repairs on US Polaris ballistic missile systems who worked with the same seals that failed on the shuttle disaster. Long before the results were published by the investigation team she met Mr. Feynman on a flight to duty stations. In their exchange he asked her what she thought was the problem and told him without a doubt it was the seals. Reagan the president at the time this disaster had exerted pressure to launch the Challenger in the overly cold weather. I also watched the media's involvement and unneeded sensationalism about the delays that undoubtedly provoked a too hasty decision to launch. I have read many management studies attributing this debacle as a legacy of the decision making process called Groupthink. As this can only be so and knowledge of the affects of cold on the seals was widely know in professional circles and also at NASA it must be surmised that we have a warped decision making system in place in our government.The lightness that Feynman's stories give to the seriousness of his academic career must only be surmised as a way of dealing with his knowledge of how many problems the Earth is facing in part due to our faulty decision making. It was driven home after watching a video about his life where I was almost brought to tears... The must see video is The Quest For Tannu Tuva[1988] which seemed to be more widely shown in the UK than in the US.Let's learn from Feynman."
175,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22392990-eoin-flynn,5,"This book is simply a reprint some of the material from the wonderful ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"".For anyone who's read that book - I wouldn't bother reading this one. There's very little new material in it and it's less detailed.Despite that, it is still a fantastic read. For anyone who hasn't read The Pleasure of Finding Things Out then pick this book up and get reading!As a scientist, I can tell you that Richard Feynman's Horizon episode from 1981 - from the transcripts of which, much of this book is taken - is one the main reasons I became a research scientist. I've watched it a million times. This book is the written form of that. It's a perfect description of what it really is to know something. Of how to accurately determine something - not just in science but in everyday life. It also serves as guide to not succumbing to the many and varied pitfalls of poor thinking. It is a very human account of a man who, even to other great scientists, seemed god-like in his intellect, how that man and that intellect came to be and how oddly achievable it seems (though of course you know it can never be for us mere mortals).From a more shallow perspective, this book is a series of witty anecdotes about a scientific genius of the 20th century that anyone can enjoy. "
176,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12973215-danny-tyran,3,"Feynman is/was (is he still alive?) brilliant, but he knew it too much. I dislike people too proud of themselves.The story line of this book is simple:1. Feynman begins something new (new course, new job, any other activity)2. He finds a way to improve some piece of equipment or some process (working process,...)3. A few people tell him that he is a genius and accept to change things (equipment or process) and most of the others resist the change suggested by Feynman4. Go to 1 and do it all again.There are some funny parts. But I'd lie if I told you that I understood everything that the author explained. Even at the very beginning, Feynman was a little boy who repaired TVs and radios for his family and for neighbors. Who still understand how worked apparels with lamps? I can't even imagine that electric devices could work that way. All I know is that sometimes the lamps burned out and you had to change them, but what if it was not a burned-out bulb that caused the problem? The author explained something that he understood very well by himself when he was around 9 years old. I still don't understand it even with his explanation. :(Anyway, if you like anecdotal stories, probably you'll like this book. I liked it, but I can't tell that I loved it."

178,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10486715-l,5,"One of the most inspirational books I have read lately. Apart from being one hilarious ride with an adventurous theoretical physicist, this book also reminded me of somewhat forgotten ways of learning, thinking and experimenting in life and academics/career. Feynman comes across as an honest, courageous, fun-filled character who had certain child-like innocence and curiosity in his spirit. The writing will make you laugh, wonder and think. Feynman's free-spirited nature, his attitude of questioning status-quo, his insatiable curiosity, his will to step out of his comfort zone and try new and often difficult things is inspiring, to the extent that one would want to break their present monotonous life and set out for their own adventure!This book demands a permanent place in your library and re-reads."
179,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222886-aasem-bakhshi,4,"There ain't any books about stubborn men who are among the most curious creatures in the universe, love to play bongos and paint nude models, jump every now and then into sense-deprivation-hallucination-trigger capsules and master the art of moving their egos out of their bodies so that they can watch themselves from outside, can crack any damn safe in the world, steal people's doors, make an atom bomb, experiment with their own dreaming and ant psychology, study at MIT and Princeton, teach at Caltech, start their careers by giving presentation to people like Wolfgang Pauli and Einstein, and end up winning the Nobel prize.So does it make any difference if such a book is written in a sloppy way? No matter how slapdash, it would end up just a tinge less then amazing, due to its extraordinary subject matter. Richard Feynman, may you rest in peace. "

Richard Feynman was a genius with a super inquiring mind that is a hallmark of all great men, but what makes him so unique is that his life didn't just have one dimension. He was curious about so many fields and activities and the way he describes them in this book are so fantastic that you end up wanting to try those things out! "

182,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1224976-julie,1,"Nope, not wasting any more time on this clown. I read up through his chapter on how to neg a woman in order to trick her into sleeping with you and thought ""Yep, I am done. Gave this the good ol' college try but the bad outweighs the good here."" Who knew Feynman, as well as being a brilliant Nobel Prize winning physicist was also the patron saint of the PUA(Pick up artist) community?I am honestly shocked at the number of rave reviews this collection of personal anecdotes has. I assume people are blinded by Feynman's intellect - which was staggering - and his joyful attitude towards learning for learning's sake. Perhaps if I had read a biography of Feynman, written by someone else, I wouldn't have had such a negative reaction to him?It seemed obvious to me, both as a former SPED teacher and as the parent of someone on the autistic spectrum, that Feynman had undiagnosed Asperger's Syndrome. He often mentions his inability to understand social cues and to interact successfully with others. His story of using other people's nervous laughter as a clue that his behavior was incorrect was telling. He couldn't tell by unspoken body language or facial expressions or tone of voice - he needed actual tittering laughter to signal that he needed to adjust his behavior. Feynman used his prodigious intellect to help him work around his deficits in social behavior but often it wasn't enough.The first painful story was that of the waitress and the tip. Oh wow. Even when telling the story, years later, he has no idea how egregious his behavior was. He pulled the juvenile trick of leaving the tip as coins with a full glass of water on top. Two glasses with the coins split between them. Just what a busy server in a restaurant wants to deal with. To add insult to injury, this was a restaurant he went to daily & a waitress that often served him. This is how he repays her for doing a good job. His motivation for being a jerk? He wanted to see if she would be able to figure out how to get her tip without making a big mess, though how he would know this is unclear, since he wasn't there when she attempted it. He returns the next day to find everyone angry at him & the waitress refusing to interact with him anymore. She didn't have time for his intellectual query - since, you know, she had an actual job she needed to be doing - and the water spilled everywhere & that made extra work for her, cleaning his mess up, and then later she slipped & hurt herself on the still damp floor. Feynman has no clue that he has done anything wrong & can't figure out why people are upset. Then - get this - HE DOES IT AGAIN WITH THE NEW WAITRESS SERVING HIM. Hardy har har, ain't he a hoot?He tells many stories like this, where he is a complete asshole to people. He can't understand why people don't trust him and think he is a liar. One thing he enjoyed doing was pretending to be drunk when he wasn't - ugh, insert big eye roll here - because, I don't know honestly. Because he has no understanding of human emotions and common reactions?I stopped reading after the anecdote about how he is a nice guy but woman still won't have sex with him - can't they see how nice he is, damn it?! - so he meets a guy who teaches him the trick is to treat women like whores and bitches. "" I adopted the attitude that those girls are all bitches, that they aren't worth anything, and that all they're in there for is to get you to buy them a drink, and they're not going to give you a goddamn thing. I'm not going to be a gentleman to such worthless bitches and so on. I learned it till it was automatic.""A good reminder that just because someone is an intellectual genius or has an amazing artistic talent or incredible physical prowess doesn't make them a decent or even likable person. People tend to ascribe positive characteristics to successful people whether they are truly worthy of them or not. Feynman is a good example of this."
183,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,2,"The bits on doing physics are interesting; the bits on picking up aging tigers in shady New York bars, not so much.This book will likely appeal far more to science fanboys and groupies rather than scientists themselves. The goal of the book seems mostly to convince lay people that scientists are indeed human beings who have hobbies, eat at restaurants, and have sexual intercourse (gasp!). Given that most scientists likely see themselves as human beings, I think the majority of the book would be quite boring for them. I personally far prefer Feynman's nonfiction books and video lectures, which are served crystal-clear with a side of motivation.However, now that I've thoroughly demotivated your wanting to read this book, there are two upsides.First, to a baby scientist (a middle-schooler, high-schooler, or college freshman aspiring to become a scientist), especially one who doesn't come from a family of scientists or hasn't met many in their life, this book is a much more inspirational look at the life of an (atypical) scientist than the Wikipedia entry on scientist. That said, if you know a youngling leaning towards a life scientific, this is a great (dangerous?) book to pass along to them.Second, hidden amongst the fluff are stellar pieces of advice for doing science, what I will refer to as ""Feynmanisms."" Most aren't explicit but are simply what I interpreted from Feynman's stories on doing science. Here's a list of my favorites:Seek people and ideas outside your own field. There's a great pressure in science to confine yourself to one field. This pressure comes from funding agencies and administrators who must be able to easily define which discipline your work is in, as well as from interactions with other scientists in your field, who will of course mostly suggest ideas and insights from within that field. Resist this pressure. Speak with scientists in either fields about their ideas and your own. Seek connections. It will often be hard to communicate but its always worth the effort.Don't be afraid to ask questions. Many a student or scientist finds himself at the end of a long lecture, completely lost because he didn't have the courage to ask what a word on the second slide meant. Get over it. You are and will always be a student and there will always be things you don't know.Think in examples. It's easy to get lost if you think about every new concept you learn in terms of another new concept you only learned ten minutes ago. Yet this is often the way books try to teach. Instead, when trying to follow an explanation, think in a concrete example and add features slowly. It might be ""faster"" to use jargon and buzzwords to explain a concept, but there's no use in this compression if you don't understand what's going on.Don't fool yourself into thinking you know something you don't. It is surprisingly easy to convince the human brain that it understands something that it most certainly does not. Knowing the name of something is not the same as understanding what it is. Throwing around buzzwords is an easy way to fake understanding to others, but it's impossible to be creative or have any fun if all you can do is mix and match buzzwords.Never stop playing. Remember why you enjoyed physics (or whichever field) in the first place; it's fun to play with ideas! No administrator or scientific colleague is ever going to ask you to spend more time playing, but that is often crucial to coming up with new ideas as well as having fun."
184,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,5,I really enjoyed this book and learning about this man. Just the kind of guy one would love to have as a friend. Such curiosity. Such lack of pretension! Marvelously enjoyable book. 
185,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"A while back, I read another book by Feynman, The Pleasure of Finding Things Out, and I wasn't all that thrilled with it. It was kind of disappointing at the time. I knew that Feynman's fame came not only from his scientific brilliance, but from the fact that he was a genuinely interesting, funny and mischievous person. I had hoped that I could find some of that in the book, but to no avail. And so I gave it away so that someone else could get the pleasure from it that I could not.Still, I was not completely turned off Feynman. There are videos of him around the internet that really show his vibrancy, his energy and the passion with which he approached the world, and I knew there would come a time when I would have to give him a second chance. Thus, this book.Surely You're Joking, Mister Feynman! is the story - or rather a collection of stories - about what can happen to a person with immense confidence in his own abilities, an insatiable curiosity about the world, a willingness to make mistakes, all topped off with a generous helping of genius.First, as Feynman calls them at the beginning of the book, some vitals. Richard Feynman was a theoretical physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project, taught at Caltech, and won the Nobel Prize in physics for his contributions to quantum electrodynamics. He was also one hell of a bongo player, an accomplished artist, and a self-taught safecracker. He was a joker and a prankster and a ladies' man who could bluff his way into pretty much anything he wanted to do, and was often surprised that people believed his bravado. He had a passion for mysteries and puzzles and figuring out how things worked, from combination locks to the movements of electrons to why water curves the way it does when it comes out the tap, and he didn't give a good goddamn about what the rest of the world thought of him.In other words, Richard Feynman was a pretty awesome guy.This book is a collection of Feynman's stories, the kind that he might tell at a party or with a bunch of friends traveling. They're the variety of story that might begin with, ""Did I ever tell you how I joined a samba band in Rio?"" and just go on from there. He starts with his youth, how he was the kind of boy who just loved to tinker with things. He would take electronics apart and put them back together, and then go to junk shops to buy parts that he could build into better radios. He did experiments with ants to find out how they communicated, and dedicated himself so hard to solving puzzles that eventually all he needed was the first line, and he could immediately come back with, ""He starts by chopping every other one in three parts.""He was one of those kids whose curiosity was boundless, and who never even imagined that there was anything ""better"" he could have been doing than exploring how the world worked. I couldn't shake the feeling that if young Feynman were around today, he'd be medicated to the eyeballs just to stop him being so ""weird."" But you know me. Cynic.We follow him through his days at MIT, pulling pranks with friends and discovering those interesting weaknesses in human thought processes that allowed him to get away with murder when he was young. His habits of wondering how things work carried him through his participation in the Manhattan Project, his travels to countries like Brazil and Japan, and led him through a life that was never without fascinating and entertaining discoveries.Long story short (too late), Feynman is - or at least should be - a model for young people today. While the book isn't pitched towards young people, there are several lessons in it that should be taught to every child.The first is that the world is infinitely interesting. Any kid who whines that she is bored needs to be shown the million and one ways that you can combat boredom just within a ten-foot radius of where you're sitting. Look at something - anything and ask yourself, ""I wonder how that works,"" and then go find out. The possibilities are endless, and the potential exists that you may discover a passion you never knew you had. Feynman didn't start out wondering how electrons work - he fixed his neighbors' radios just because he could. One thing led to another, and next thing you know - BAM! Nobel Prize.The second point, and it is connected to the first, is to never say No. In his essay, ""But Is It Art?"" he talks about how he learned to draw. It started when an artist friend offered to teach Feynman how to draw if he would teach the artist about science. While Feynman believed that he would be an absolutely atrocious artist, he still agreed to the challenge, and he stuck with it. Eventually he became well-known as a decent artist, even managing to sell some of his works. Now obviously, there are limits and caveats to ""never"" - there are times when saying No is the right thing to do. But when you find an opportunity to expand your abilities, to learn new things and face new challenges, the automatic ""No"" may deprive you of a joy that you never knew you could experience.Third, you must know who you are. One of the problems inherent in living in a society is that there's always someone trying to tell you who you are, or at least who you should be. Your parents, teachers, friends, all have an image of you in their heads, and are all trying to mold you into that image, consciously or unconsciously. Add to that the government, media, corporations, advertisements, shysters, preachers and other deliverers of hokum and propaganda who are also trying to tell you who you really are, despite having never met you and being pretty sure that you don't already know yourself. And many people, sadly, don't. But Feynman did. He knew who he was, and that was all he needed. He occasionally let people think differently about him, but the thread that runs through this book is a rock-solid self-awareness that allowed him the self-confidence to pick up showgirls or try to turn down a Nobel Prize.The caveat to this, and a corollary to the second point, is that you can always discover new things about who you are. All through the book, we see Feynman faced with a new opportunity that he thinks he can't do because it's just Not Him. Drawing, playing music, learning languages - those skills didn't fit into the mental model of who he thought he was, a flaw that all of us possess. A lot of us, without even giving it a try, might immediately discard something by saying, ""Well, that's just not me."" Maybe it could be. It takes courage, and the willingness to fall flat on your face, but if you can discover a new talent or a new passion, isn't it worth it?Finally, remember that everyone else around you is just as human as you are. Don't be impressed by titles and uniforms, fancy suits and impressive business cards. Don't assume that just because someone wears a soldier's uniform or a thousand dollar suit that they are somehow ""better"" than you. Feynman not only resisted authority in so many of these tales, he actively worked to subvert it. Whether it's trying to sneak codes past military censors or breaking into the safe that held all the secrets of the atomic bomb, he never let a title get in the way of learning or growing.One of my favorite Feynman stories related to this last point isn't actually in this book, but I'll mention it anyway. After the Challenger disaster back in 1986, NASA was called on the carpet to explain to Congress why their shiny new space shuttle went Kaboom. The NASA managers went on and on about the O-rings, filling their talk with supercilious jargon and doublespeak, hoping that their haughty attitudes and impenetrable explanations of why the cold weather made the O-rings fail would be comprehensible enough to satisfy the committee, yet obtuse enough to avoid actually admitting that they had done anything wrong. While they were doing this, Feynman put a piece of the O-ring material into a glass of ice water and let it sit there for a while. Then he took it out, stretched it, and showed that it had lost the pliability that it needed to do its job. With a simple demonstration, he not only showed the fault that led to the Challenger explosion, but at the same time put a bunch of self-aggrandizing stuffed shirts in their places.I love that story.Anyway, if you're looking for a Feynman book to read - and who isn't? - this is the one to start with. There's not much hard talk about science in it, just lots of stories about a really interesting guy. Even if it doesn't make you want to get into quantum electrodynamic theory, I hope it still makes you look at the world in a different way."
186,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93868753-rubel-rana,5,"One of the most beautiful minds in the history of human race was talking to me like a 12 years old boy with full of ebullience. Although I imagined him as a demure individual, and thought It would be a sluggish writing, But it turned out to be dulcet. I didn't even expect that His life round efflorescence beautiful brain and who himself was a harbinger who had knowledge of past also could be this hilarious and this down to earth. I laughed and got astonished that how easily and in a lilt way he handled in the real time and later discussed it in this book of all those imbroglios.Anyway I never write reviews of books, I just simply share my feelings. This was no way more than that. I wish time travel was possible so that I could meet Einstein, Feynman, Carl Sagan, Marie Curie And the love of my life Audrey Hepburn. I love Feynman that much, So I would've given 100 stars to it let alone 5 ❤️"
187,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5014554-jack,5,"I found myself unable to make fair judgement about: Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a Curious Character. One day I gave it three stars and another five. I should think that it certainly deserves five stars in that it is one of the few books that delve into the mind of a genius and gives some idea to their thought process's. My desire to write a review of this book are threefold:I was stationed in Orlando Florida and it was mandatory that we watch the liftoff's.After the Challenger shuttle disaster I worked for a woman who did quality assurance for repairs on US Polaris ballistic missile systems who worked with the same seals that failed on the shuttle disaster. Long before the results were published by the investigation team she met Mr. Feynman on a flight to duty stations. In their exchange he asked her what she thought was the problem and told him without a doubt it was the seals. Reagan the president at the time this disaster had exerted pressure to launch the Challenger in the overly cold weather. I also watched the media's involvement and unneeded sensationalism about the delays that undoubtedly provoked a too hasty decision to launch. I have read many management studies attributing this debacle as a legacy of the decision making process called Groupthink. As this can only be so and knowledge of the affects of cold on the seals was widely know in professional circles and also at NASA it must be surmised that we have a warped decision making system in place in our government.The lightness that Feynman's stories give to the seriousness of his academic career must only be surmised as a way of dealing with his knowledge of how many problems the Earth is facing in part due to our faulty decision making. It was driven home after watching a video about his life where I was almost brought to tears... The must see video is The Quest For Tannu Tuva[1988] which seemed to be more widely shown in the UK than in the US.Let's learn from Feynman."
188,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68153-maura,2,"this turned into a book i was racing thru just so it would be over. it's not that it's bad. it's essentially a compendium of all the stories Feynman could tell during a dinner party. and the stories are well told, and there's many amusing bits in them. but, you see, i didn't end up liking him. and in real life, i would have probably been amused by him at the first party, only spent a short time with him at the 2nd party, and then spent any further parties making sure i was in another part of the room. his ego, it's just too big. and he spends way too much time talking down his accomplishments only to build himself up even higher than when he started, often at the expense of someone else.all that said, i suspect he would have been a good professor to have [he's good with the concrete examples of the few physics problems he mentions in this book], and if i run across some of his collected physics lectures, i would probably read them and learn a lot."
189,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2758455-katy,4,"A nice collection of stories from the life of Dr. Feynman. Not only was he a Nobel Prize winning physicist, but also truly a man who loved learning and was curious of most things."
190,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,1,"I totally agree with Emily, the top reviewer with 113 comments, most of them chastising her for not loving this book, and many of them trying to imply she's simply not smart enough to appreciate Feynman if she doesn't love it. Without attempting to demean or diminish Feynman's actual brilliance and greatness as a scientist, I declare: this book is annoying as shit. Without dismissing the many very real talents Mr. Feynman had, I'm not convinced that compelling and empathetic writing was one of them. I'm aware this book is little more than a compilation of interviews with Feynman, so perhaps the blame there lies with his co-author/editor, who took Feynman too much at his literal word and failed to effectively work the many anecdotes into a pleasing and well-written whole. I'm told Feynman was a very likeable guy, but the guy who comes across in these anecdotes seems to me to be only likeable in small doses. He seems bombastic, overbearing, even a bit grandiose in his manner, despite paying lip service to modesty – and by this, I don't just mean he spends too much time bragging about how clever he is, which he also does. Don't bother dinging me for saying this by pointing out that he IS pretty goddamn clever and has earned some bragging rights - I'm aware of that, and I don't care. He could be the smartest person in the history of the world, but braggadocio is still not an attractive habit. And don't try to tell me it's an essential quality of an autobiography, either. I've read other autobiographies where people spend upward of 300 pages talking about themselves without making me want to punt them.No, I sense something deeper in Feynman's manner of speaking that says to me, This person is utterly arrogant and yes, self-aggrandizing. (Emily's word.) It strikes me as the sound of someone who's spent too much of his life with his fanboys hanging on his every word, so that now he thinks every word that comes out of his mouth is actually worth hanging on. This may be a justifiable mistake for someone in Feynman's position, but that doesn't make it any less a mistake. In fact, I think it's a mistake that is at the heart of this book – the concept of, “It's Feynman, so of COURSE we can just compile a bunch of interviews with him about random shit he did one time, put them in chronological order, and it'll be great!”And I don't find Feynman nearly as funny, endearing, or even interesting as he thinks he is. To be fair, I admit he seems from afar like a terribly interesting man, but I quickly discovered I do NOT want to spend 11 solid hours listening to him tell seemingly random and generally trivial stories about episodes in his life. One or two anecdotes may be mildly entertaining, but his style gets old in a hurry, and his sense of humor seems downright mean-spirited at times. Perhaps my mistake was in attempting to vread it straight through – I don't really have any other way to vread. But you can only vread so many anecdotes about experimenting with ants and their pheromone trails or working on broken radios as a kid before you realize each one may be slightly interesting, but when you put them all together in a row, their total interest value doesn't accumulate. Meanwhile, Feynman's annoyance value DOES. Therefore, I recommend this book (a) in small doses, say for example as light bedtime reading, or (b) for those on the “Feynman can do no wrong” bandwagon. This latter group is his true audience – the ones who are delighted to hang on every word that comes out of his mouth. And I suspect that in the latter half of his life, he moved through a world so surrounded by those people that he forgot there was anything else. I could be wrong – maybe it's not Feynman's fault at all, and this isn't really him. This could be just the aspect of him that's been asked to sit down in front of a microphone and tell every story about himself that he can think of. When your friends tell you that your war stories are so awesome they should be compiled and published as a book, is there any other way it can really come out?Audio notes: The audio version is not helped by a narrator who seems to be sort of channeling Feynman's manner of speaking – his rhythms and intonations, though not his accent or timbre – and it makes a slightly annoying series of anecdotes that much MORE annoying and somewhat duller than the material itself would warrant. I pulled up recordings of Feynman's lectures and more casual interviews, and there's enough of a match to his casual speech patterns that I think it's intentional. But it's as though the narrator learned to imitate Feynman by listening to him speak a single sentence, and then he just repeats that sentence over and over. Every sentence has the exact same rhythm and intonation as the one before it, and it's all a little too fast and perky, so it's like being forced to spend 11 hours listening to a salesman's patter. Somewhere between that and Chinese water torture."
191,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3764819-barb,2,"The subtitle of this book is ""Adventures of a Curious Character."" I would definitely say that Richard Feynman is curious--the probably one thing I liked about him was his interest is exploring the world beyond just the physics he specialized in. He worked with biologists when he could've worked with physicists; he tried out deprivation tanks. He pushed himself to learn new languages and paint and get out of his comfort zone. That's admirable.However. The man was insufferable. This book, which is largely a series of stories he told to a friend in a very informal manner, is anecdote after anecdote of him saying, essentially, how much better he was than others. How his was the right way of thinking. He would try to be self-deprecating, but it inevitably wound up as ""But it turned out I was the most awesome!"" Stories tended to go something like, ""Some really smart people were talking about something. I'm such an idiot, and didn't know anything about that topic, but threw out an idea that sprang to mind, because I'm too stupid not to say whatever I'm thinking. And then they lit up! 'What a great idea!' they said. It was really just luck that it happened that way."" Repeat ad infinitum. Some of his stories from his childhood were interesting--and the book is probably best read in brief snippets, so the ego doesn't overwhelm you. But he lost me when relaying the story of putting a waitress's tip under an upside-down full glass of water. And he remained proud of himself for that. The man was not nice. He wasn't a good guy. He didn't feel the need to contribute to the common good. He had zero problems making others' lives miserable, like when he agreed to give a class at a local college, provided he only had to fill out so many forms. Turned out, it required one more form than originally agreed-upon, but instead of just signing it, he made the poor college employee go to what Feynman himself describes as a lot of trouble just to not fill out the form. And he refused to submit receipts for reimbursement (though at least there he accepted that that meant he wouldn't get the money).This isn't even getting into his stories about women.The book wasn't all bad. Like I said, Feynman had some redeeming qualities. He's someone who would be interesting to chat with for a few minutes at a party. But ultimately, as good as he may have been at science and as many interesting stories he may have had, Dick Feynman is not someone I want to spend more time with."
192,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67794375-david,3,"Richard Feynman understood physics. His reader, the cerebral and equally pulchritudinous, david, knows not a thing about physics. Okay, that is not true. “Things fall when you drop them,” I have observed, time and again. Therefore, I have an aptitude for science.I can relate.This guy won a Nobel Prize, hung with Einstein and Oppenheimer, and discovered and documented events that I do not feel like sharing, mostly because I cannot.I, unlike Feynman, garnered a trophy in wrestling. An unusual one. I was one of the few kids on any high school grappling team to have viewed the ceilings of each tournament visited (that is not a good thing in this sport). And it was not by design, but by ambivalence. If at first, you do not succeed, no one really cares. I did not know any scientists, but I did occasion ‘Feinstein & Schloppenheimer’s Deli.’ Ah, the pastrami on rye, you could just die, literally. And still, like every solid American who has learned not to enjoy anything ‘too much,’ I ripened into a vegan decades ago. Go figure. Please pass the Kombucha.A very interesting story, this was. Feynman had his tale to tell and it was atypical. He was one of the architects in the development of the nuclear bomb and was an instructor and/or a student at MIT, Caltech, Cornell, and other top schools. His take on academia for a lifetime, with a IQ that could travel the autobahn but not I-80, makes for some funny moments.He had the corny sense of humor you would expect from a full-time scientist. And much of it made for an enjoyable read, although I go deaf when it comes to jokes that include numbers.So, in conclusion, I would like to thank the members of the Academy, my school teachers who assuaged my youth with ‘C’s rather than ‘F’s and the good people of the Seychelles. Pax vobiscum and give my regards to Broadway."
193,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,5,"I had soooo much fun reading this book! It's as if you're sitting in a room with Feynman and you're just randomly telling stories. Very natural, very rich, inspiring and, well, what I enjoyed the most of course, his views of life felt often times aligned with mine, so what's not to love about that? :PThis is a man who knew how to live and how to find beauty in everything he did. His strong curiosity is what makes a difference between a great person who can create whatever he sets his mind on doing, and a random person who simply knows facts about art/science/news but can't use them to create or really understand anything whatsoever.The book is funny and clever. I absolutely loved it and will surely read it again at some point in my life!Here are some quotes that I really connected with:""And, just like it should in all stories about philosophers, it ended up in complete chaos.""""There were a lot of fools at the conference - pompous fools - and pompous fools drive me up the wall. Ordinary fools are all right; you can talk to them, and try to help them out. But pompous fools - guys who are fools and are covering it all over and impressing people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus - that, I cannot stand!""""[...] I was in Italy for a science conference and I thought I'd like to see the Sistine Chapel. I got there very early in the morning, bought my ticket before anybody else, and ran up the stairs as soon as the place opened. I therefore had the unusual pleasure of looking at the whole chapel for a moment, in silent awe, before anybody else came in."""
194,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42787747-thinn,4,"I really like how human he is in this book. There was no heroic moment he mentioned about himself and he even admitted his mistakes! He was very curious. He was curious in almost all the area and he picked at them so quick especially in arts! He was good at arts and music.I also like the part where he talked about ants. He redirect the ants’ route. When I was young, my sister and I did a bit experiment about ants too! I would say he is mischievous at the offices. Messing around with people about safe! I want to hear more about his colleagues point of view too.  He reminds me of Forrest Gump. Both of them were so curious about everything and good at whatever they put foot in it. Here are a few quotes that I like from the book. The last one was from the speech from Caltech commencement in 1974. ‘Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that’s the end of you.’ ‘The first principle is that you must not fool yourself- and you are the easiest person to fool.’ ‘So I have just one wish for you- the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of Inter gritty I have described, and and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.’ The only thing I don’t like about him is his involvement of Manhattan Project. "
195,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/436784-leippya,5,"A fascinating read, and also surprisingly hilarious! I didn't expect to burst out laughing while reading the autobiography of a physicist but that's what ended up happening -- Feynman definitely was a first class prankster! Although physics are often mentioned, you don't need to really know about it to be able to enjoy the book; this is more about his life than his work. It's a joy to read about how much this man enjoys learning, not only physics but also music (bongo player!), painting and so on. Makes you just want to learn those things you've been postponing for a while. I cringed a bit at the way most women are represented in the book, but if that's how the women he met really were, there's nothing really to do about it, you can't rewrite history.I would really advise everybody to read this book. Feynman is a Nobel Prize winner, worked on the atomic bomb and is such an interesting and funny person to read about. Really, what I'm going to remember most from this book is how thoroughly that guy enjoyed life and embraced any challenge he set his mind on."
196,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2646348-natalie,5,"This should be made compulsory in school. At a very basic level as a collection of humorous anecdotes and zany adventures, it already deserves 5 stars, but it is so much more than just a funny book. There is plenty of serious insight and we are so fortunate to have a glimpse into Feynman's ingenious childlike mind. Reading it brings me real comfort to know I'm on the right track - that it's right to remain intellectually curious, that there's fun in learning, that you should always go back to first principles, and that you should never lose any intellectual integrity. So it is baffling and disheartening to see some bad reviews. To anyone who sees this book as self-aggrandizing, you're completely missing the point and I hope you stay a rare breed. But I'm open to hearing you out and I would be grateful if you could share your reasons because I'm just not seeing it at all. My only regret is that I didn't read this sooner, but better late than never. "
197,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5547564-david,5,"Simply put: To date, it is the most thoroughly enjoyable memoir I have ever read! I love Feynman's accounts of his life, of his interminable curiosity, of his brilliance, of his determination to never say ""I can't do this"" and keep at it until he learned, whether it was physics (for which he won the Nobel Prize), learning Portugese, learning to draw, learning to socialize in a bar, learning drums. So inspirational and full of Feynman's very humorous wit throughout. I loved every minute of this!! For audiobook listeners, Raymond Todd absolutely nails the correct tone!"

I can only give 5 stars to it?And then you think you should give every other book less stars, because they are not as awesome as this one.And THEN you think about the inspiring character this book is about and that he is such a positive person and never would give other people get less, just because he is so awesome. And then you are just sad that the book is over and thankful that you could read it : ) "
199,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27248823-vishal,5,"How much do you think a person can do in a single lifetime despite having a dedicated attachment to the ever-demanding(and boring, according to laypeople) field of Theoretical Physics?He can learn to make good enough paintings to be shown in an one-man exhibition. He can learn to play Bongo well enough to be included in street competition in pre-carnival seasons in a city of Brazil. He can play drums for a Ballet which would win a national level award. He can learn to crack safes and pick locks which would give him a reputation all over his work arena. He can make reliable observations and conclusions by practicing hallucination, analyzing dreams by falling in and out of sleep, by making an experiment on ants and showing their lack of sense of geometry. He can learn many languages. He can get drunk every now and then in bars and pick up girls. He can stop drinking at once when he wishes to. Despite all of this, he can still win a Nobel Prize.Richard Feynman, the coolest Physicist ever, shows you the vast array of possibilities to consider and explore if you begin with a child-like curiousity about the world and don't let it fade away with passing years of your life. Before reading this book, I was little apprehensive about what I am supposed to do in life if I like so many things and am afraid to pick up one because I don't want losing my other fields of interest. So one of the greatest teachers, Feynman, showed me the way that if you remain curious and manage your time, you can pursue whatever you want.This book of anecdotes might seem a little exaggerating and annoying to some people, who altogether miss the idea of the lessons the author is trying to propagate. One of the reviews on Goodreads says that, the book is full of arrogance and how Feynman is showing off his skills at so many things and taking pride in himself. I pity the poor reviewer who missed the point that how Feynman is not showing that ""I could do it"", he is showing that ""it can be done by you too"". So much rant for the ignorant laypeople.Inspite of the anecdotes about Feynman ""having fun"", the most important parts of this book to be circulated and popularized are his views on pseudo-science and scientific integrity. He experimented with much of pseudo-science including psychics, hallucinations and dream-interpretations and explained the scientific side of those phenomena. He explained how ignorant people are fooled by the practitioners of pseudo-science. About his remarks on scientific integrity, it is a must read for anyone who wishes to pursue science, and it should be read by laypeople too so that they could see how science works and why is it preferable to any cult of faith believe system. He explains the importance of experiments and shows you to be patient with them in the part about his experiments on ants.""You are not obliged to be what others expect you ought to be. If you don't be what they want you to be, it's a failing of their judgement, not your own."" A quote that could be misinterpreted too, but it would be clear when one knows the context in which Feynman said those words. After the death of his first wife and returning from the Nuclear bomb project, he was depressed and had a sense of loss of his zeal for Physics. He was teaching Physics but he didn't think he was making enough contribution to research according to what was expected of him. That's when he explains how he stopped caring and started to play with Science for the love of it. He started with a trivial experiment of analyzing spinning plates and this lead to the ideas in Quantam Physics which later won him the Nobel Prize. The story of recovering is impressive and inspiring, if my elaborations here don't make a convincing case for it then I suggest you to take my word for it and read the part.In conclusion, this is one of the books which you can include in your list of 'Life-changing books'. You can read it again and again, everytime you'll learn something new. Everytime the book will offer a new perspective onto life. Everytime, you'll see how to live a life that is full of Life. "

Incredible passion to science and asking simple question 'why' on all the surrounding things. The relation to the system of education and science in the world of memorising the facts and past discoveries can be summarised in the following quote: ""I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something"""
201,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"It seems only natural to begin my thoughts on this book with a quote from Feynman :The first principle is that you must not fool yourself. And you are the easiest person to fool. These words capture the essence of what formed Feynman's portrait. Someone who questioned all the established notions and believed in science to be ultimately a trial and error method to arrive at the truth. His is a first rate scientific mind that never stops at anything unless he arrives at a conclusion that is satisfying and in accordance with common sense. What makes him different is the fact that he does not stop here but goes one step further to ensure that he does communicate this in the most simplest fashion possible. It is a book long glimpse to the mind of a funny, intelligent and humane persona that made up Richard Feynman.What strikes you most about him is his utter lack of pretension. For a man who won a Nobel, worked on the Manhattan project and has a string of achievements in the field of physics to his credit, he is entirely unassuming. He assumes the same air of fun and gaiety in discussing the Manhattan project as he does on how to flirt with the showgirls in Vegas. This is a no holds barred account of his life and a detailed elucidation on some of his thoughts and perspectives. If I was asked to pick what stood out of this book, I would pick the attribute of curiosity. You do not need a sharp mind to pick out the number of times he tinkers around to find the underlying truths all because it got him curious. The second aspect is that he never shied away from learning all through his life. From what I can recollect right now, he went along and studied how to make music at a Brazilian Carnival, how to gamble like a high roller, how to play bongo drums, how to be interesting to women without emptying your pocket in the process and so on. If you look at these things he learned, they have nothing to do with science but that never stopped him. All that mattered to him was the learning and how to be good at what you learn. It baffled me to see that he could manage to learn so much in one single lifetime. Feynman was never the highbrow kind to spurn all these as beneath him but he embraced all these as the little things that make our World fun to live in. Feynman was above everything else an epitome of irreverence. Social niceties never sat well with him and he was the kind to call a spade its real name, in the loudest way possible no matter what the occasion was . Bureaucracy was what suffered his wrath the most through pranks and vociferous protests. Here is what he had to say about the ruling elite and its policies :  I know it is the way the Government works ; well screw the Government ! I feel that human beings should treat human beings like human beings. And unless I am treated like one, I'm not going to have anything to do with them.  These acts of rebelliousness chose to make him a kind of social pariah, but Feynman being Feynman cared not two hoots about it !This is no biography but an exploration of things that caught his interest from everything ranging from Mayan hieroglyphics and quarks to hallucinations and good looking girls. A very interesting set of anecdotes about a rather unique human being. Recommended. "
202,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"The Most Fascinating ManI just met the most fascinating man in my life – just finished reading “Surely You Must be Joking Mr. Feynman”. Here is a man who is probably one of the brightest that ever walked on this planet. A person who was relentlessly curious, and not just about his own craft, but about almost everything he encountered. An incredibly mischievous person who took nothing very seriously, but at the same time took everything seriously enough to explore passionately. Feynman was obsessed with solving problems, and not just in Physics but anything that he took interest in, and that’s a very large universe from machines to drumming, from school education to picking up women in a bar, from art to Mayan hieroglyphics. Above all, he was a man who was irreverent towards all ideas until it made complete sense to him.What bothered Feynman the most was people’s lack of deep understanding of what they believe they understand. Most of us believe we understand a few things, especially things that relate to our professions, but do we really? Most of us have a very superficial sense of things that we know, which may be adequate to waddle through our jobs and our life, but the kind of deep understanding that Feynman is referring to, where everything fits together and makes perfect sense, where one is capable of explaining to another individual with perfect clarity, is mostly missing. Even more dangerous is that fact that most of us are not even aware how muddled our understandings are. Most of us, as individuals, and sometimes entire professions, suffer from this grand illusion without ever being challenged.I wish I read this book many decades earlier, because there was a possibility that it could have changed my life. I believe it should be a must-read for all young people, especially those that plan to take up a scientific, or for that matter, any intellectual profession. Looking back at my childhood, I had very similar curiosities as Feynman, and like him I spent most of my time tinkering with things and exploring everything from fire to ants and from machines to questions like why we find something musical. However, I was not even nearly as smart, but more importantly, I did not have his perseverance. Many of us are curious when we are young, but intellectual laziness prevents us from exploring them adequately. Most of us also lack the spirit to challenge all ideas that came from authority sources. To Feynman, every idea had to make perfect sense to him, and until then he simply would not accept them. I, on the other hand, grew up with values that tried to convince me that having some “beliefs” is a virtue. These beliefs did not come as religious or social dictates but more as moral and political wisdom, and I convinced my young mind that I am making perfectly rational choices. The funny thing is, if you asked me when I was in my teens or twenties. I would have proclaimed the same mindset that Feynman had, except I really did not practice it. What a remarkable human being – almost unbelievable! I have never met or seen Feynman. Once I stood just outside his office door in CalTech. I have been extremely lucky to have met and spent time with his close friend and colleague Murray Gell-Mann, who is often mentioned in this book. Another astounding mind…"
203,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31318644-ankit-kumar,5,"Well, another autobiographical book which I loved very much. This time it is from a visionary whom I have admired for a long time, without knowing much about his work and life. This book gives a such an honest account of the life of Feynman, that too by himself. You will never read a better book by someone like this. The title of the book does full justice to the material inside the book, right from the first page. Feynman pens down all of his adventures in life which revolves around his passion- ""Physics"". And other stuff that he learned and talked because he was curious about them. He was a person, who will not accept something just by hearing it or just by looking at it from face value, He would go great length to understand the reason behind them, by himself. After much thought and deliberation, he will accept it with full integrity and fight for it, or reject it forthright and will continue to do so without fearing the consequences. There is so much to learn from the character of Feynman. I cannot do justice by writing about that in this review, but you ought to read it and understand it and feel it yourself. Do read this book, you will have so much fun reading about his adventures and also sound reasons behind them. This book has so many complex concepts, phenomena are discussed with such humility and simplicity, and without any pretence that only Feynman could have (or I have read till date about in a person). The last few paragraphs of the book, in which Feynman gives advice about how to maintain integrity in scientific pursuit by anyone, and take full responsibility of what you are doing and why you are doing so, particularly given me so much to think about my own practice and future in science. I would like to finish this review by quoting Feynman, from this book, which I found very inspirational and something which we should think about all the time in our lives. "" You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.""~ Richard P. Feynman(Surely you're joking Mr Feynman)"
204,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3989689-asails-f,5,"I found myself unable to make fair judgement about: Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a Curious Character. One day I gave it three stars and another five. I should think that it certainly deserves five stars in that it is one of the few books that delve into the mind of a genius and gives some idea to their thought process's. My desire to write a review of this book are threefold:I was stationed in Orlando Florida and it was mandatory that we watch the liftoff's.After the Challenger shuttle disaster I worked for a woman who did quality assurance for repairs on US Polaris ballistic missile systems who worked with the same seals that failed on the shuttle disaster. Long before the results were published by the investigation team she met Mr. Feynman on a flight to duty stations. In their exchange he asked her what she thought was the problem and told him without a doubt it was the seals. Reagan the president at the time this disaster had exerted pressure to launch the Challenger in the overly cold weather. I also watched the media's involvement and unneeded sensationalism about the delays that undoubtedly provoked a too hasty decision to launch. I have read many management studies attributing this debacle as a legacy of the decision making process called Groupthink. As this can only be so and knowledge of the affects of cold on the seals was widely know in professional circles and also at NASA it must be surmised that we have a warped decision making system in place in our government.The lightness that Feynman's stories give to the seriousness of his academic career must only be surmised as a way of dealing with his knowledge of how many problems the Earth is facing in part due to our faulty decision making. It was driven home after watching a video about his life where I was almost brought to tears... The must see video is The Quest For Tannu Tuva[1988] which seemed to be more widely shown in the UK than in the US.Let's learn from Feynman."
205,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22392990-eoin-flynn,5,"This book is simply a reprint some of the material from the wonderful ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"".For anyone who's read that book - I wouldn't bother reading this one. There's very little new material in it and it's less detailed.Despite that, it is still a fantastic read. For anyone who hasn't read The Pleasure of Finding Things Out then pick this book up and get reading!As a scientist, I can tell you that Richard Feynman's Horizon episode from 1981 - from the transcripts of which, much of this book is taken - is one the main reasons I became a research scientist. I've watched it a million times. This book is the written form of that. It's a perfect description of what it really is to know something. Of how to accurately determine something - not just in science but in everyday life. It also serves as guide to not succumbing to the many and varied pitfalls of poor thinking. It is a very human account of a man who, even to other great scientists, seemed god-like in his intellect, how that man and that intellect came to be and how oddly achievable it seems (though of course you know it can never be for us mere mortals).From a more shallow perspective, this book is a series of witty anecdotes about a scientific genius of the 20th century that anyone can enjoy. "
206,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12973215-danny-tyran,3,"Feynman is/was (is he still alive?) brilliant, but he knew it too much. I dislike people too proud of themselves.The story line of this book is simple:1. Feynman begins something new (new course, new job, any other activity)2. He finds a way to improve some piece of equipment or some process (working process,...)3. A few people tell him that he is a genius and accept to change things (equipment or process) and most of the others resist the change suggested by Feynman4. Go to 1 and do it all again.There are some funny parts. But I'd lie if I told you that I understood everything that the author explained. Even at the very beginning, Feynman was a little boy who repaired TVs and radios for his family and for neighbors. Who still understand how worked apparels with lamps? I can't even imagine that electric devices could work that way. All I know is that sometimes the lamps burned out and you had to change them, but what if it was not a burned-out bulb that caused the problem? The author explained something that he understood very well by himself when he was around 9 years old. I still don't understand it even with his explanation. :(Anyway, if you like anecdotal stories, probably you'll like this book. I liked it, but I can't tell that I loved it."

208,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10486715-l,5,"One of the most inspirational books I have read lately. Apart from being one hilarious ride with an adventurous theoretical physicist, this book also reminded me of somewhat forgotten ways of learning, thinking and experimenting in life and academics/career. Feynman comes across as an honest, courageous, fun-filled character who had certain child-like innocence and curiosity in his spirit. The writing will make you laugh, wonder and think. Feynman's free-spirited nature, his attitude of questioning status-quo, his insatiable curiosity, his will to step out of his comfort zone and try new and often difficult things is inspiring, to the extent that one would want to break their present monotonous life and set out for their own adventure!This book demands a permanent place in your library and re-reads."
209,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222886-aasem-bakhshi,4,"There ain't any books about stubborn men who are among the most curious creatures in the universe, love to play bongos and paint nude models, jump every now and then into sense-deprivation-hallucination-trigger capsules and master the art of moving their egos out of their bodies so that they can watch themselves from outside, can crack any damn safe in the world, steal people's doors, make an atom bomb, experiment with their own dreaming and ant psychology, study at MIT and Princeton, teach at Caltech, start their careers by giving presentation to people like Wolfgang Pauli and Einstein, and end up winning the Nobel prize.So does it make any difference if such a book is written in a sloppy way? No matter how slapdash, it would end up just a tinge less then amazing, due to its extraordinary subject matter. Richard Feynman, may you rest in peace. "

Richard Feynman was a genius with a super inquiring mind that is a hallmark of all great men, but what makes him so unique is that his life didn't just have one dimension. He was curious about so many fields and activities and the way he describes them in this book are so fantastic that you end up wanting to try those things out! "

212,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1224976-julie,1,"Nope, not wasting any more time on this clown. I read up through his chapter on how to neg a woman in order to trick her into sleeping with you and thought ""Yep, I am done. Gave this the good ol' college try but the bad outweighs the good here."" Who knew Feynman, as well as being a brilliant Nobel Prize winning physicist was also the patron saint of the PUA(Pick up artist) community?I am honestly shocked at the number of rave reviews this collection of personal anecdotes has. I assume people are blinded by Feynman's intellect - which was staggering - and his joyful attitude towards learning for learning's sake. Perhaps if I had read a biography of Feynman, written by someone else, I wouldn't have had such a negative reaction to him?It seemed obvious to me, both as a former SPED teacher and as the parent of someone on the autistic spectrum, that Feynman had undiagnosed Asperger's Syndrome. He often mentions his inability to understand social cues and to interact successfully with others. His story of using other people's nervous laughter as a clue that his behavior was incorrect was telling. He couldn't tell by unspoken body language or facial expressions or tone of voice - he needed actual tittering laughter to signal that he needed to adjust his behavior. Feynman used his prodigious intellect to help him work around his deficits in social behavior but often it wasn't enough.The first painful story was that of the waitress and the tip. Oh wow. Even when telling the story, years later, he has no idea how egregious his behavior was. He pulled the juvenile trick of leaving the tip as coins with a full glass of water on top. Two glasses with the coins split between them. Just what a busy server in a restaurant wants to deal with. To add insult to injury, this was a restaurant he went to daily & a waitress that often served him. This is how he repays her for doing a good job. His motivation for being a jerk? He wanted to see if she would be able to figure out how to get her tip without making a big mess, though how he would know this is unclear, since he wasn't there when she attempted it. He returns the next day to find everyone angry at him & the waitress refusing to interact with him anymore. She didn't have time for his intellectual query - since, you know, she had an actual job she needed to be doing - and the water spilled everywhere & that made extra work for her, cleaning his mess up, and then later she slipped & hurt herself on the still damp floor. Feynman has no clue that he has done anything wrong & can't figure out why people are upset. Then - get this - HE DOES IT AGAIN WITH THE NEW WAITRESS SERVING HIM. Hardy har har, ain't he a hoot?He tells many stories like this, where he is a complete asshole to people. He can't understand why people don't trust him and think he is a liar. One thing he enjoyed doing was pretending to be drunk when he wasn't - ugh, insert big eye roll here - because, I don't know honestly. Because he has no understanding of human emotions and common reactions?I stopped reading after the anecdote about how he is a nice guy but woman still won't have sex with him - can't they see how nice he is, damn it?! - so he meets a guy who teaches him the trick is to treat women like whores and bitches. "" I adopted the attitude that those girls are all bitches, that they aren't worth anything, and that all they're in there for is to get you to buy them a drink, and they're not going to give you a goddamn thing. I'm not going to be a gentleman to such worthless bitches and so on. I learned it till it was automatic.""A good reminder that just because someone is an intellectual genius or has an amazing artistic talent or incredible physical prowess doesn't make them a decent or even likable person. People tend to ascribe positive characteristics to successful people whether they are truly worthy of them or not. Feynman is a good example of this."
213,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,2,"The bits on doing physics are interesting; the bits on picking up aging tigers in shady New York bars, not so much.This book will likely appeal far more to science fanboys and groupies rather than scientists themselves. The goal of the book seems mostly to convince lay people that scientists are indeed human beings who have hobbies, eat at restaurants, and have sexual intercourse (gasp!). Given that most scientists likely see themselves as human beings, I think the majority of the book would be quite boring for them. I personally far prefer Feynman's nonfiction books and video lectures, which are served crystal-clear with a side of motivation.However, now that I've thoroughly demotivated your wanting to read this book, there are two upsides.First, to a baby scientist (a middle-schooler, high-schooler, or college freshman aspiring to become a scientist), especially one who doesn't come from a family of scientists or hasn't met many in their life, this book is a much more inspirational look at the life of an (atypical) scientist than the Wikipedia entry on scientist. That said, if you know a youngling leaning towards a life scientific, this is a great (dangerous?) book to pass along to them.Second, hidden amongst the fluff are stellar pieces of advice for doing science, what I will refer to as ""Feynmanisms."" Most aren't explicit but are simply what I interpreted from Feynman's stories on doing science. Here's a list of my favorites:Seek people and ideas outside your own field. There's a great pressure in science to confine yourself to one field. This pressure comes from funding agencies and administrators who must be able to easily define which discipline your work is in, as well as from interactions with other scientists in your field, who will of course mostly suggest ideas and insights from within that field. Resist this pressure. Speak with scientists in either fields about their ideas and your own. Seek connections. It will often be hard to communicate but its always worth the effort.Don't be afraid to ask questions. Many a student or scientist finds himself at the end of a long lecture, completely lost because he didn't have the courage to ask what a word on the second slide meant. Get over it. You are and will always be a student and there will always be things you don't know.Think in examples. It's easy to get lost if you think about every new concept you learn in terms of another new concept you only learned ten minutes ago. Yet this is often the way books try to teach. Instead, when trying to follow an explanation, think in a concrete example and add features slowly. It might be ""faster"" to use jargon and buzzwords to explain a concept, but there's no use in this compression if you don't understand what's going on.Don't fool yourself into thinking you know something you don't. It is surprisingly easy to convince the human brain that it understands something that it most certainly does not. Knowing the name of something is not the same as understanding what it is. Throwing around buzzwords is an easy way to fake understanding to others, but it's impossible to be creative or have any fun if all you can do is mix and match buzzwords.Never stop playing. Remember why you enjoyed physics (or whichever field) in the first place; it's fun to play with ideas! No administrator or scientific colleague is ever going to ask you to spend more time playing, but that is often crucial to coming up with new ideas as well as having fun."
214,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,5,I really enjoyed this book and learning about this man. Just the kind of guy one would love to have as a friend. Such curiosity. Such lack of pretension! Marvelously enjoyable book. 
215,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"A while back, I read another book by Feynman, The Pleasure of Finding Things Out, and I wasn't all that thrilled with it. It was kind of disappointing at the time. I knew that Feynman's fame came not only from his scientific brilliance, but from the fact that he was a genuinely interesting, funny and mischievous person. I had hoped that I could find some of that in the book, but to no avail. And so I gave it away so that someone else could get the pleasure from it that I could not.Still, I was not completely turned off Feynman. There are videos of him around the internet that really show his vibrancy, his energy and the passion with which he approached the world, and I knew there would come a time when I would have to give him a second chance. Thus, this book.Surely You're Joking, Mister Feynman! is the story - or rather a collection of stories - about what can happen to a person with immense confidence in his own abilities, an insatiable curiosity about the world, a willingness to make mistakes, all topped off with a generous helping of genius.First, as Feynman calls them at the beginning of the book, some vitals. Richard Feynman was a theoretical physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project, taught at Caltech, and won the Nobel Prize in physics for his contributions to quantum electrodynamics. He was also one hell of a bongo player, an accomplished artist, and a self-taught safecracker. He was a joker and a prankster and a ladies' man who could bluff his way into pretty much anything he wanted to do, and was often surprised that people believed his bravado. He had a passion for mysteries and puzzles and figuring out how things worked, from combination locks to the movements of electrons to why water curves the way it does when it comes out the tap, and he didn't give a good goddamn about what the rest of the world thought of him.In other words, Richard Feynman was a pretty awesome guy.This book is a collection of Feynman's stories, the kind that he might tell at a party or with a bunch of friends traveling. They're the variety of story that might begin with, ""Did I ever tell you how I joined a samba band in Rio?"" and just go on from there. He starts with his youth, how he was the kind of boy who just loved to tinker with things. He would take electronics apart and put them back together, and then go to junk shops to buy parts that he could build into better radios. He did experiments with ants to find out how they communicated, and dedicated himself so hard to solving puzzles that eventually all he needed was the first line, and he could immediately come back with, ""He starts by chopping every other one in three parts.""He was one of those kids whose curiosity was boundless, and who never even imagined that there was anything ""better"" he could have been doing than exploring how the world worked. I couldn't shake the feeling that if young Feynman were around today, he'd be medicated to the eyeballs just to stop him being so ""weird."" But you know me. Cynic.We follow him through his days at MIT, pulling pranks with friends and discovering those interesting weaknesses in human thought processes that allowed him to get away with murder when he was young. His habits of wondering how things work carried him through his participation in the Manhattan Project, his travels to countries like Brazil and Japan, and led him through a life that was never without fascinating and entertaining discoveries.Long story short (too late), Feynman is - or at least should be - a model for young people today. While the book isn't pitched towards young people, there are several lessons in it that should be taught to every child.The first is that the world is infinitely interesting. Any kid who whines that she is bored needs to be shown the million and one ways that you can combat boredom just within a ten-foot radius of where you're sitting. Look at something - anything and ask yourself, ""I wonder how that works,"" and then go find out. The possibilities are endless, and the potential exists that you may discover a passion you never knew you had. Feynman didn't start out wondering how electrons work - he fixed his neighbors' radios just because he could. One thing led to another, and next thing you know - BAM! Nobel Prize.The second point, and it is connected to the first, is to never say No. In his essay, ""But Is It Art?"" he talks about how he learned to draw. It started when an artist friend offered to teach Feynman how to draw if he would teach the artist about science. While Feynman believed that he would be an absolutely atrocious artist, he still agreed to the challenge, and he stuck with it. Eventually he became well-known as a decent artist, even managing to sell some of his works. Now obviously, there are limits and caveats to ""never"" - there are times when saying No is the right thing to do. But when you find an opportunity to expand your abilities, to learn new things and face new challenges, the automatic ""No"" may deprive you of a joy that you never knew you could experience.Third, you must know who you are. One of the problems inherent in living in a society is that there's always someone trying to tell you who you are, or at least who you should be. Your parents, teachers, friends, all have an image of you in their heads, and are all trying to mold you into that image, consciously or unconsciously. Add to that the government, media, corporations, advertisements, shysters, preachers and other deliverers of hokum and propaganda who are also trying to tell you who you really are, despite having never met you and being pretty sure that you don't already know yourself. And many people, sadly, don't. But Feynman did. He knew who he was, and that was all he needed. He occasionally let people think differently about him, but the thread that runs through this book is a rock-solid self-awareness that allowed him the self-confidence to pick up showgirls or try to turn down a Nobel Prize.The caveat to this, and a corollary to the second point, is that you can always discover new things about who you are. All through the book, we see Feynman faced with a new opportunity that he thinks he can't do because it's just Not Him. Drawing, playing music, learning languages - those skills didn't fit into the mental model of who he thought he was, a flaw that all of us possess. A lot of us, without even giving it a try, might immediately discard something by saying, ""Well, that's just not me."" Maybe it could be. It takes courage, and the willingness to fall flat on your face, but if you can discover a new talent or a new passion, isn't it worth it?Finally, remember that everyone else around you is just as human as you are. Don't be impressed by titles and uniforms, fancy suits and impressive business cards. Don't assume that just because someone wears a soldier's uniform or a thousand dollar suit that they are somehow ""better"" than you. Feynman not only resisted authority in so many of these tales, he actively worked to subvert it. Whether it's trying to sneak codes past military censors or breaking into the safe that held all the secrets of the atomic bomb, he never let a title get in the way of learning or growing.One of my favorite Feynman stories related to this last point isn't actually in this book, but I'll mention it anyway. After the Challenger disaster back in 1986, NASA was called on the carpet to explain to Congress why their shiny new space shuttle went Kaboom. The NASA managers went on and on about the O-rings, filling their talk with supercilious jargon and doublespeak, hoping that their haughty attitudes and impenetrable explanations of why the cold weather made the O-rings fail would be comprehensible enough to satisfy the committee, yet obtuse enough to avoid actually admitting that they had done anything wrong. While they were doing this, Feynman put a piece of the O-ring material into a glass of ice water and let it sit there for a while. Then he took it out, stretched it, and showed that it had lost the pliability that it needed to do its job. With a simple demonstration, he not only showed the fault that led to the Challenger explosion, but at the same time put a bunch of self-aggrandizing stuffed shirts in their places.I love that story.Anyway, if you're looking for a Feynman book to read - and who isn't? - this is the one to start with. There's not much hard talk about science in it, just lots of stories about a really interesting guy. Even if it doesn't make you want to get into quantum electrodynamic theory, I hope it still makes you look at the world in a different way."

Although I imagined him as a demure individual, and thought It would be a sluggish writing, But it turned out to be dulcet. I didn't even expect that His life round efflorescence beautiful brain and who himself was a harbinger who had knowledge of past also could be this hilarious and this down to earth. I laughed and got astonished that how easily and in a lilt way he handled in the real time and later discussed it in this book of all those imbroglios.Anyway I never write reviews of books, I just simply share my feelings. This was no way more than that. I wish time travel was possible so that I could meet Einstein, Feynman, Carl Sagan, Marie Curie And the love of my life Audrey Hepburn. I love Feynman that much, So I would've given 100 stars to it let alone 5 ❤️"
217,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5014554-jack,5,"I found myself unable to make fair judgement about: Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a Curious Character. One day I gave it three stars and another five. I should think that it certainly deserves five stars in that it is one of the few books that delve into the mind of a genius and gives some idea to their thought process's. My desire to write a review of this book are threefold:I was stationed in Orlando Florida and it was mandatory that we watch the liftoff's.After the Challenger shuttle disaster I worked for a woman who did quality assurance for repairs on US Polaris ballistic missile systems who worked with the same seals that failed on the shuttle disaster. Long before the results were published by the investigation team she met Mr. Feynman on a flight to duty stations. In their exchange he asked her what she thought was the problem and told him without a doubt it was the seals. Reagan the president at the time this disaster had exerted pressure to launch the Challenger in the overly cold weather. I also watched the media's involvement and unneeded sensationalism about the delays that undoubtedly provoked a too hasty decision to launch. I have read many management studies attributing this debacle as a legacy of the decision making process called Groupthink. As this can only be so and knowledge of the affects of cold on the seals was widely know in professional circles and also at NASA it must be surmised that we have a warped decision making system in place in our government.The lightness that Feynman's stories give to the seriousness of his academic career must only be surmised as a way of dealing with his knowledge of how many problems the Earth is facing in part due to our faulty decision making. It was driven home after watching a video about his life where I was almost brought to tears... The must see video is The Quest For Tannu Tuva[1988] which seemed to be more widely shown in the UK than in the US.Let's learn from Feynman."
218,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68153-maura,2,"this turned into a book i was racing thru just so it would be over. it's not that it's bad. it's essentially a compendium of all the stories Feynman could tell during a dinner party. and the stories are well told, and there's many amusing bits in them. but, you see, i didn't end up liking him. and in real life, i would have probably been amused by him at the first party, only spent a short time with him at the 2nd party, and then spent any further parties making sure i was in another part of the room. his ego, it's just too big. and he spends way too much time talking down his accomplishments only to build himself up even higher than when he started, often at the expense of someone else.all that said, i suspect he would have been a good professor to have [he's good with the concrete examples of the few physics problems he mentions in this book], and if i run across some of his collected physics lectures, i would probably read them and learn a lot."
219,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2758455-katy,4,"A nice collection of stories from the life of Dr. Feynman. Not only was he a Nobel Prize winning physicist, but also truly a man who loved learning and was curious of most things."
220,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,1,"I totally agree with Emily, the top reviewer with 113 comments, most of them chastising her for not loving this book, and many of them trying to imply she's simply not smart enough to appreciate Feynman if she doesn't love it. Without attempting to demean or diminish Feynman's actual brilliance and greatness as a scientist, I declare: this book is annoying as shit. Without dismissing the many very real talents Mr. Feynman had, I'm not convinced that compelling and empathetic writing was one of them. I'm aware this book is little more than a compilation of interviews with Feynman, so perhaps the blame there lies with his co-author/editor, who took Feynman too much at his literal word and failed to effectively work the many anecdotes into a pleasing and well-written whole. I'm told Feynman was a very likeable guy, but the guy who comes across in these anecdotes seems to me to be only likeable in small doses. He seems bombastic, overbearing, even a bit grandiose in his manner, despite paying lip service to modesty – and by this, I don't just mean he spends too much time bragging about how clever he is, which he also does. Don't bother dinging me for saying this by pointing out that he IS pretty goddamn clever and has earned some bragging rights - I'm aware of that, and I don't care. He could be the smartest person in the history of the world, but braggadocio is still not an attractive habit. And don't try to tell me it's an essential quality of an autobiography, either. I've read other autobiographies where people spend upward of 300 pages talking about themselves without making me want to punt them.No, I sense something deeper in Feynman's manner of speaking that says to me, This person is utterly arrogant and yes, self-aggrandizing. (Emily's word.) It strikes me as the sound of someone who's spent too much of his life with his fanboys hanging on his every word, so that now he thinks every word that comes out of his mouth is actually worth hanging on. This may be a justifiable mistake for someone in Feynman's position, but that doesn't make it any less a mistake. In fact, I think it's a mistake that is at the heart of this book – the concept of, “It's Feynman, so of COURSE we can just compile a bunch of interviews with him about random shit he did one time, put them in chronological order, and it'll be great!”And I don't find Feynman nearly as funny, endearing, or even interesting as he thinks he is. To be fair, I admit he seems from afar like a terribly interesting man, but I quickly discovered I do NOT want to spend 11 solid hours listening to him tell seemingly random and generally trivial stories about episodes in his life. One or two anecdotes may be mildly entertaining, but his style gets old in a hurry, and his sense of humor seems downright mean-spirited at times. Perhaps my mistake was in attempting to vread it straight through – I don't really have any other way to vread. But you can only vread so many anecdotes about experimenting with ants and their pheromone trails or working on broken radios as a kid before you realize each one may be slightly interesting, but when you put them all together in a row, their total interest value doesn't accumulate. Meanwhile, Feynman's annoyance value DOES. Therefore, I recommend this book (a) in small doses, say for example as light bedtime reading, or (b) for those on the “Feynman can do no wrong” bandwagon. This latter group is his true audience – the ones who are delighted to hang on every word that comes out of his mouth. And I suspect that in the latter half of his life, he moved through a world so surrounded by those people that he forgot there was anything else. I could be wrong – maybe it's not Feynman's fault at all, and this isn't really him. This could be just the aspect of him that's been asked to sit down in front of a microphone and tell every story about himself that he can think of. When your friends tell you that your war stories are so awesome they should be compiled and published as a book, is there any other way it can really come out?Audio notes: The audio version is not helped by a narrator who seems to be sort of channeling Feynman's manner of speaking – his rhythms and intonations, though not his accent or timbre – and it makes a slightly annoying series of anecdotes that much MORE annoying and somewhat duller than the material itself would warrant. I pulled up recordings of Feynman's lectures and more casual interviews, and there's enough of a match to his casual speech patterns that I think it's intentional. But it's as though the narrator learned to imitate Feynman by listening to him speak a single sentence, and then he just repeats that sentence over and over. Every sentence has the exact same rhythm and intonation as the one before it, and it's all a little too fast and perky, so it's like being forced to spend 11 hours listening to a salesman's patter. Somewhere between that and Chinese water torture."
221,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3764819-barb,2,"The subtitle of this book is ""Adventures of a Curious Character."" I would definitely say that Richard Feynman is curious--the probably one thing I liked about him was his interest is exploring the world beyond just the physics he specialized in. He worked with biologists when he could've worked with physicists; he tried out deprivation tanks. He pushed himself to learn new languages and paint and get out of his comfort zone. That's admirable.However. The man was insufferable. This book, which is largely a series of stories he told to a friend in a very informal manner, is anecdote after anecdote of him saying, essentially, how much better he was than others. How his was the right way of thinking. He would try to be self-deprecating, but it inevitably wound up as ""But it turned out I was the most awesome!"" Stories tended to go something like, ""Some really smart people were talking about something. I'm such an idiot, and didn't know anything about that topic, but threw out an idea that sprang to mind, because I'm too stupid not to say whatever I'm thinking. And then they lit up! 'What a great idea!' they said. It was really just luck that it happened that way."" Repeat ad infinitum. Some of his stories from his childhood were interesting--and the book is probably best read in brief snippets, so the ego doesn't overwhelm you. But he lost me when relaying the story of putting a waitress's tip under an upside-down full glass of water. And he remained proud of himself for that. The man was not nice. He wasn't a good guy. He didn't feel the need to contribute to the common good. He had zero problems making others' lives miserable, like when he agreed to give a class at a local college, provided he only had to fill out so many forms. Turned out, it required one more form than originally agreed-upon, but instead of just signing it, he made the poor college employee go to what Feynman himself describes as a lot of trouble just to not fill out the form. And he refused to submit receipts for reimbursement (though at least there he accepted that that meant he wouldn't get the money).This isn't even getting into his stories about women.The book wasn't all bad. Like I said, Feynman had some redeeming qualities. He's someone who would be interesting to chat with for a few minutes at a party. But ultimately, as good as he may have been at science and as many interesting stories he may have had, Dick Feynman is not someone I want to spend more time with."
222,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67794375-david,3,"Richard Feynman understood physics. His reader, the cerebral and equally pulchritudinous, david, knows not a thing about physics. Okay, that is not true. “Things fall when you drop them,” I have observed, time and again. Therefore, I have an aptitude for science.I can relate.This guy won a Nobel Prize, hung with Einstein and Oppenheimer, and discovered and documented events that I do not feel like sharing, mostly because I cannot.I, unlike Feynman, garnered a trophy in wrestling. An unusual one. I was one of the few kids on any high school grappling team to have viewed the ceilings of each tournament visited (that is not a good thing in this sport). And it was not by design, but by ambivalence. If at first, you do not succeed, no one really cares. I did not know any scientists, but I did occasion ‘Feinstein & Schloppenheimer’s Deli.’ Ah, the pastrami on rye, you could just die, literally. And still, like every solid American who has learned not to enjoy anything ‘too much,’ I ripened into a vegan decades ago. Go figure. Please pass the Kombucha.A very interesting story, this was. Feynman had his tale to tell and it was atypical. He was one of the architects in the development of the nuclear bomb and was an instructor and/or a student at MIT, Caltech, Cornell, and other top schools. His take on academia for a lifetime, with a IQ that could travel the autobahn but not I-80, makes for some funny moments.He had the corny sense of humor you would expect from a full-time scientist. And much of it made for an enjoyable read, although I go deaf when it comes to jokes that include numbers.So, in conclusion, I would like to thank the members of the Academy, my school teachers who assuaged my youth with ‘C’s rather than ‘F’s and the good people of the Seychelles. Pax vobiscum and give my regards to Broadway."
223,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,5,"I had soooo much fun reading this book! It's as if you're sitting in a room with Feynman and you're just randomly telling stories. Very natural, very rich, inspiring and, well, what I enjoyed the most of course, his views of life felt often times aligned with mine, so what's not to love about that? :PThis is a man who knew how to live and how to find beauty in everything he did. His strong curiosity is what makes a difference between a great person who can create whatever he sets his mind on doing, and a random person who simply knows facts about art/science/news but can't use them to create or really understand anything whatsoever.The book is funny and clever. I absolutely loved it and will surely read it again at some point in my life!Here are some quotes that I really connected with:""And, just like it should in all stories about philosophers, it ended up in complete chaos.""""There were a lot of fools at the conference - pompous fools - and pompous fools drive me up the wall. Ordinary fools are all right; you can talk to them, and try to help them out. But pompous fools - guys who are fools and are covering it all over and impressing people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus - that, I cannot stand!""""[...] I was in Italy for a science conference and I thought I'd like to see the Sistine Chapel. I got there very early in the morning, bought my ticket before anybody else, and ran up the stairs as soon as the place opened.

224,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42787747-thinn,4,"I really like how human he is in this book. There was no heroic moment he mentioned about himself and he even admitted his mistakes! He was very curious. He was curious in almost all the area and he picked at them so quick especially in arts! He was good at arts and music.I also like the part where he talked about ants. He redirect the ants’ route. When I was young, my sister and I did a bit experiment about ants too! I would say he is mischievous at the offices. Messing around with people about safe! I want to hear more about his colleagues point of view too.  He reminds me of Forrest Gump. Both of them were so curious about everything and good at whatever they put foot in it. Here are a few quotes that I like from the book. The last one was from the speech from Caltech commencement in 1974. ‘Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that’s the end of you.’ ‘The first principle is that you must not fool yourself- and you are the easiest person to fool.’ ‘So I have just one wish for you- the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of Inter gritty I have described, and and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.’ The only thing I don’t like about him is his involvement of Manhattan Project. "
225,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/436784-leippya,5,"A fascinating read, and also surprisingly hilarious! I didn't expect to burst out laughing while reading the autobiography of a physicist but that's what ended up happening -- Feynman definitely was a first class prankster! Although physics are often mentioned, you don't need to really know about it to be able to enjoy the book; this is more about his life than his work. It's a joy to read about how much this man enjoys learning, not only physics but also music (bongo player!), painting and so on. Makes you just want to learn those things you've been postponing for a while. I cringed a bit at the way most women are represented in the book, but if that's how the women he met really were, there's nothing really to do about it, you can't rewrite history.I would really advise everybody to read this book. Feynman is a Nobel Prize winner, worked on the atomic bomb and is such an interesting and funny person to read about. Really, what I'm going to remember most from this book is how thoroughly that guy enjoyed life and embraced any challenge he set his mind on."
226,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2646348-natalie,5,"This should be made compulsory in school. At a very basic level as a collection of humorous anecdotes and zany adventures, it already deserves 5 stars, but it is so much more than just a funny book. There is plenty of serious insight and we are so fortunate to have a glimpse into Feynman's ingenious childlike mind. Reading it brings me real comfort to know I'm on the right track - that it's right to remain intellectually curious, that there's fun in learning, that you should always go back to first principles, and that you should never lose any intellectual integrity. So it is baffling and disheartening to see some bad reviews. To anyone who sees this book as self-aggrandizing, you're completely missing the point and I hope you stay a rare breed. But I'm open to hearing you out and I would be grateful if you could share your reasons because I'm just not seeing it at all. My only regret is that I didn't read this sooner, but better late than never. "
227,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5547564-david,5,"Simply put: To date, it is the most thoroughly enjoyable memoir I have ever read! I love Feynman's accounts of his life, of his interminable curiosity, of his brilliance, of his determination to never say ""I can't do this"" and keep at it until he learned, whether it was physics (for which he won the Nobel Prize), learning Portugese, learning to draw, learning to socialize in a bar, learning drums. So inspirational and full of Feynman's very humorous wit throughout. I loved every minute of this!! For audiobook listeners, Raymond Todd absolutely nails the correct tone!"
228,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14875421-anna,5,"It's one of those books after which you think: WHAT? I can only give 5 stars to it?And then you think you should give every other book less stars, because they are not as awesome as this one.And THEN you think about the inspiring character this book is about and that he is such a positive person and never would give other people get less, just because he is so awesome. And then you are just sad that the book is over and thankful that you could read it : ) "

He can learn to play Bongo well enough to be included in street competition in pre-carnival seasons in a city of Brazil. He can play drums for a Ballet which would win a national level award. He can learn to crack safes and pick locks which would give him a reputation all over his work arena. He can make reliable observations and conclusions by practicing hallucination, analyzing dreams by falling in and out of sleep, by making an experiment on ants and showing their lack of sense of geometry. He can learn many languages. He can get drunk every now and then in bars and pick up girls. He can stop drinking at once when he wishes to. Despite all of this, he can still win a Nobel Prize.Richard Feynman, the coolest Physicist ever, shows you the vast array of possibilities to consider and explore if you begin with a child-like curiousity about the world and don't let it fade away with passing years of your life. Before reading this book, I was little apprehensive about what I am supposed to do in life if I like so many things and am afraid to pick up one because I don't want losing my other fields of interest. So one of the greatest teachers, Feynman, showed me the way that if you remain curious and manage your time, you can pursue whatever you want.This book of anecdotes might seem a little exaggerating and annoying to some people, who altogether miss the idea of the lessons the author is trying to propagate. One of the reviews on Goodreads says that, the book is full of arrogance and how Feynman is showing off his skills at so many things and taking pride in himself. I pity the poor reviewer who missed the point that how Feynman is not showing that ""I could do it"", he is showing that ""it can be done by you too"". So much rant for the ignorant laypeople.Inspite of the anecdotes about Feynman ""having fun"", the most important parts of this book to be circulated and popularized are his views on pseudo-science and scientific integrity. He experimented with much of pseudo-science including psychics, hallucinations and dream-interpretations and explained the scientific side of those phenomena. He explained how ignorant people are fooled by the practitioners of pseudo-science. About his remarks on scientific integrity, it is a must read for anyone who wishes to pursue science, and it should be read by laypeople too so that they could see how science works and why is it preferable to any cult of faith believe system. He explains the importance of experiments and shows you to be patient with them in the part about his experiments on ants.""You are not obliged to be what others expect you ought to be. If you don't be what they want you to be, it's a failing of their judgement, not your own."" A quote that could be misinterpreted too, but it would be clear when one knows the context in which Feynman said those words. After the death of his first wife and returning from the Nuclear bomb project, he was depressed and had a sense of loss of his zeal for Physics. He was teaching Physics but he didn't think he was making enough contribution to research according to what was expected of him. That's when he explains how he stopped caring and started to play with Science for the love of it. He started with a trivial experiment of analyzing spinning plates and this lead to the ideas in Quantam Physics which later won him the Nobel Prize. The story of recovering is impressive and inspiring, if my elaborations here don't make a convincing case for it then I suggest you to take my word for it and read the part.In conclusion, this is one of the books which you can include in your list of 'Life-changing books'. You can read it again and again, everytime you'll learn something new. Everytime the book will offer a new perspective onto life. Everytime, you'll see how to live a life that is full of Life. "

Incredible passion to science and asking simple question 'why' on all the surrounding things. The relation to the system of education and science in the world of memorising the facts and past discoveries can be summarised in the following quote: ""I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something"""
231,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"It seems only natural to begin my thoughts on this book with a quote from Feynman :The first principle is that you must not fool yourself. And you are the easiest person to fool. These words capture the essence of what formed Feynman's portrait. Someone who questioned all the established notions and believed in science to be ultimately a trial and error method to arrive at the truth. His is a first rate scientific mind that never stops at anything unless he arrives at a conclusion that is satisfying and in accordance with common sense. What makes him different is the fact that he does not stop here but goes one step further to ensure that he does communicate this in the most simplest fashion possible. It is a book long glimpse to the mind of a funny, intelligent and humane persona that made up Richard Feynman.What strikes you most about him is his utter lack of pretension. For a man who won a Nobel, worked on the Manhattan project and has a string of achievements in the field of physics to his credit, he is entirely unassuming. He assumes the same air of fun and gaiety in discussing the Manhattan project as he does on how to flirt with the showgirls in Vegas. This is a no holds barred account of his life and a detailed elucidation on some of his thoughts and perspectives. If I was asked to pick what stood out of this book, I would pick the attribute of curiosity. You do not need a sharp mind to pick out the number of times he tinkers around to find the underlying truths all because it got him curious. The second aspect is that he never shied away from learning all through his life. From what I can recollect right now, he went along and studied how to make music at a Brazilian Carnival, how to gamble like a high roller, how to play bongo drums, how to be interesting to women without emptying your pocket in the process and so on. If you look at these things he learned, they have nothing to do with science but that never stopped him. All that mattered to him was the learning and how to be good at what you learn. It baffled me to see that he could manage to learn so much in one single lifetime. Feynman was never the highbrow kind to spurn all these as beneath him but he embraced all these as the little things that make our World fun to live in. Feynman was above everything else an epitome of irreverence. Social niceties never sat well with him and he was the kind to call a spade its real name, in the loudest way possible no matter what the occasion was . Bureaucracy was what suffered his wrath the most through pranks and vociferous protests. Here is what he had to say about the ruling elite and its policies :  I know it is the way the Government works ; well screw the Government ! I feel that human beings should treat human beings like human beings. And unless I am treated like one, I'm not going to have anything to do with them.  These acts of rebelliousness chose to make him a kind of social pariah, but Feynman being Feynman cared not two hoots about it !This is no biography but an exploration of things that caught his interest from everything ranging from Mayan hieroglyphics and quarks to hallucinations and good looking girls. A very interesting set of anecdotes about a rather unique human being. Recommended. "
232,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"The Most Fascinating ManI just met the most fascinating man in my life – just finished reading “Surely You Must be Joking Mr. Feynman”. Here is a man who is probably one of the brightest that ever walked on this planet. A person who was relentlessly curious, and not just about his own craft, but about almost everything he encountered. An incredibly mischievous person who took nothing very seriously, but at the same time took everything seriously enough to explore passionately. Feynman was obsessed with solving problems, and not just in Physics but anything that he took interest in, and that’s a very large universe from machines to drumming, from school education to picking up women in a bar, from art to Mayan hieroglyphics. Above all, he was a man who was irreverent towards all ideas until it made complete sense to him.What bothered Feynman the most was people’s lack of deep understanding of what they believe they understand. Most of us believe we understand a few things, especially things that relate to our professions, but do we really? Most of us have a very superficial sense of things that we know, which may be adequate to waddle through our jobs and our life, but the kind of deep understanding that Feynman is referring to, where everything fits together and makes perfect sense, where one is capable of explaining to another individual with perfect clarity, is mostly missing. Even more dangerous is that fact that most of us are not even aware how muddled our understandings are. Most of us, as individuals, and sometimes entire professions, suffer from this grand illusion without ever being challenged.I wish I read this book many decades earlier, because there was a possibility that it could have changed my life. I believe it should be a must-read for all young people, especially those that plan to take up a scientific, or for that matter, any intellectual profession. Looking back at my childhood, I had very similar curiosities as Feynman, and like him I spent most of my time tinkering with things and exploring everything from fire to ants and from machines to questions like why we find something musical. However, I was not even nearly as smart, but more importantly, I did not have his perseverance. Many of us are curious when we are young, but intellectual laziness prevents us from exploring them adequately. Most of us also lack the spirit to challenge all ideas that came from authority sources. To Feynman, every idea had to make perfect sense to him, and until then he simply would not accept them. I, on the other hand, grew up with values that tried to convince me that having some “beliefs” is a virtue. These beliefs did not come as religious or social dictates but more as moral and political wisdom, and I convinced my young mind that I am making perfectly rational choices. The funny thing is, if you asked me when I was in my teens or twenties. I would have proclaimed the same mindset that Feynman had, except I really did not practice it. What a remarkable human being – almost unbelievable! I have never met or seen Feynman. Once I stood just outside his office door in CalTech. I have been extremely lucky to have met and spent time with his close friend and colleague Murray Gell-Mann, who is often mentioned in this book. Another astounding mind…"
233,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31318644-ankit-kumar,5,"Well, another autobiographical book which I loved very much. This time it is from a visionary whom I have admired for a long time, without knowing much about his work and life. This book gives a such an honest account of the life of Feynman, that too by himself. You will never read a better book by someone like this. The title of the book does full justice to the material inside the book, right from the first page. Feynman pens down all of his adventures in life which revolves around his passion- ""Physics"". And other stuff that he learned and talked because he was curious about them. He was a person, who will not accept something just by hearing it or just by looking at it from face value, He would go great length to understand the reason behind them, by himself. After much thought and deliberation, he will accept it with full integrity and fight for it, or reject it forthright and will continue to do so without fearing the consequences. There is so much to learn from the character of Feynman. I cannot do justice by writing about that in this review, but you ought to read it and understand it and feel it yourself. Do read this book, you will have so much fun reading about his adventures and also sound reasons behind them. This book has so many complex concepts, phenomena are discussed with such humility and simplicity, and without any pretence that only Feynman could have (or I have read till date about in a person). The last few paragraphs of the book, in which Feynman gives advice about how to maintain integrity in scientific pursuit by anyone, and take full responsibility of what you are doing and why you are doing so, particularly given me so much to think about my own practice and future in science. I would like to finish this review by quoting Feynman, from this book, which I found very inspirational and something which we should think about all the time in our lives. "" You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.""~ Richard P. Feynman(Surely you're joking Mr Feynman)"

There's very little new material in it and it's less detailed.Despite that, it is still a fantastic read. For anyone who hasn't read The Pleasure of Finding Things Out then pick this book up and get reading!As a scientist, I can tell you that Richard Feynman's Horizon episode from 1981 - from the transcripts of which, much of this book is taken - is one the main reasons I became a research scientist. I've watched it a million times. This book is the written form of that. It's a perfect description of what it really is to know something. Of how to accurately determine something - not just in science but in everyday life. It also serves as guide to not succumbing to the many and varied pitfalls of poor thinking. It is a very human account of a man who, even to other great scientists, seemed god-like in his intellect, how that man and that intellect came to be and how oddly achievable it seems (though of course you know it can never be for us mere mortals).From a more shallow perspective, this book is a series of witty anecdotes about a scientific genius of the 20th century that anyone can enjoy. "
236,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12973215-danny-tyran,3,"Feynman is/was (is he still alive?) brilliant, but he knew it too much. I dislike people too proud of themselves.The story line of this book is simple:1. Feynman begins something new (new course, new job, any other activity)2. He finds a way to improve some piece of equipment or some process (working process,...)3. A few people tell him that he is a genius and accept to change things (equipment or process) and most of the others resist the change suggested by Feynman4. Go to 1 and do it all again.There are some funny parts. But I'd lie if I told you that I understood everything that the author explained. Even at the very beginning, Feynman was a little boy who repaired TVs and radios for his family and for neighbors. Who still understand how worked apparels with lamps? I can't even imagine that electric devices could work that way. All I know is that sometimes the lamps burned out and you had to change them, but what if it was not a burned-out bulb that caused the problem? The author explained something that he understood very well by himself when he was around 9 years old. I still don't understand it even with his explanation. :(Anyway, if you like anecdotal stories, probably you'll like this book. I liked it, but I can't tell that I loved it."

Apart from being one hilarious ride with an adventurous theoretical physicist, this book also reminded me of somewhat forgotten ways of learning, thinking and experimenting in life and academics/career. Feynman comes across as an honest, courageous, fun-filled character who had certain child-like innocence and curiosity in his spirit. The writing will make you laugh, wonder and think. Feynman's free-spirited nature, his attitude of questioning status-quo, his insatiable curiosity, his will to step out of his comfort zone and try new and often difficult things is inspiring, to the extent that one would want to break their present monotonous life and set out for their own adventure!This book demands a permanent place in your library and re-reads."

242,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1224976-julie,1,"Nope, not wasting any more time on this clown. I read up through his chapter on how to neg a woman in order to trick her into sleeping with you and thought ""Yep, I am done. Gave this the good ol' college try but the bad outweighs the good here."" Who knew Feynman, as well as being a brilliant Nobel Prize winning physicist was also the patron saint of the PUA(Pick up artist) community?I am honestly shocked at the number of rave reviews this collection of personal anecdotes has. I assume people are blinded by Feynman's intellect - which was staggering - and his joyful attitude towards learning for learning's sake. Perhaps if I had read a biography of Feynman, written by someone else, I wouldn't have had such a negative reaction to him?It seemed obvious to me, both as a former SPED teacher and as the parent of someone on the autistic spectrum, that Feynman had undiagnosed Asperger's Syndrome. He often mentions his inability to understand social cues and to interact successfully with others. His story of using other people's nervous laughter as a clue that his behavior was incorrect was telling. He couldn't tell by unspoken body language or facial expressions or tone of voice - he needed actual tittering laughter to signal that he needed to adjust his behavior. Feynman used his prodigious intellect to help him work around his deficits in social behavior but often it wasn't enough.The first painful story was that of the waitress and the tip. Oh wow. Even when telling the story, years later, he has no idea how egregious his behavior was. He pulled the juvenile trick of leaving the tip as coins with a full glass of water on top. Two glasses with the coins split between them. Just what a busy server in a restaurant wants to deal with. To add insult to injury, this was a restaurant he went to daily & a waitress that often served him. This is how he repays her for doing a good job. His motivation for being a jerk? He wanted to see if she would be able to figure out how to get her tip without making a big mess, though how he would know this is unclear, since he wasn't there when she attempted it. He returns the next day to find everyone angry at him & the waitress refusing to interact with him anymore. She didn't have time for his intellectual query - since, you know, she had an actual job she needed to be doing - and the water spilled everywhere & that made extra work for her, cleaning his mess up, and then later she slipped & hurt herself on the still damp floor. Feynman has no clue that he has done anything wrong & can't figure out why people are upset. Then - get this - HE DOES IT AGAIN WITH THE NEW WAITRESS SERVING HIM. Hardy har har, ain't he a hoot?He tells many stories like this, where he is a complete asshole to people. He can't understand why people don't trust him and think he is a liar. One thing he enjoyed doing was pretending to be drunk when he wasn't - ugh, insert big eye roll here - because, I don't know honestly. Because he has no understanding of human emotions and common reactions?I stopped reading after the anecdote about how he is a nice guy but woman still won't have sex with him - can't they see how nice he is, damn it?! - so he meets a guy who teaches him the trick is to treat women like whores and bitches. "" I adopted the attitude that those girls are all bitches, that they aren't worth anything, and that all they're in there for is to get you to buy them a drink, and they're not going to give you a goddamn thing. I'm not going to be a gentleman to such worthless bitches and so on. I learned it till it was automatic.""A good reminder that just because someone is an intellectual genius or has an amazing artistic talent or incredible physical prowess doesn't make them a decent or even likable person. People tend to ascribe positive characteristics to successful people whether they are truly worthy of them or not. Feynman is a good example of this."
243,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,2,"The bits on doing physics are interesting; the bits on picking up aging tigers in shady New York bars, not so much.This book will likely appeal far more to science fanboys and groupies rather than scientists themselves. The goal of the book seems mostly to convince lay people that scientists are indeed human beings who have hobbies, eat at restaurants, and have sexual intercourse (gasp!). Given that most scientists likely see themselves as human beings, I think the majority of the book would be quite boring for them. I personally far prefer Feynman's nonfiction books and video lectures, which are served crystal-clear with a side of motivation.However, now that I've thoroughly demotivated your wanting to read this book, there are two upsides.First, to a baby scientist (a middle-schooler, high-schooler, or college freshman aspiring to become a scientist), especially one who doesn't come from a family of scientists or hasn't met many in their life, this book is a much more inspirational look at the life of an (atypical) scientist than the Wikipedia entry on scientist. That said, if you know a youngling leaning towards a life scientific, this is a great (dangerous?) book to pass along to them.Second, hidden amongst the fluff are stellar pieces of advice for doing science, what I will refer to as ""Feynmanisms."" Most aren't explicit but are simply what I interpreted from Feynman's stories on doing science. Here's a list of my favorites:Seek people and ideas outside your own field. There's a great pressure in science to confine yourself to one field. This pressure comes from funding agencies and administrators who must be able to easily define which discipline your work is in, as well as from interactions with other scientists in your field, who will of course mostly suggest ideas and insights from within that field. Resist this pressure. Speak with scientists in either fields about their ideas and your own. Seek connections. It will often be hard to communicate but its always worth the effort.Don't be afraid to ask questions. Many a student or scientist finds himself at the end of a long lecture, completely lost because he didn't have the courage to ask what a word on the second slide meant. Get over it. You are and will always be a student and there will always be things you don't know.Think in examples. It's easy to get lost if you think about every new concept you learn in terms of another new concept you only learned ten minutes ago. Yet this is often the way books try to teach. Instead, when trying to follow an explanation, think in a concrete example and add features slowly. It might be ""faster"" to use jargon and buzzwords to explain a concept, but there's no use in this compression if you don't understand what's going on.Don't fool yourself into thinking you know something you don't. It is surprisingly easy to convince the human brain that it understands something that it most certainly does not. Knowing the name of something is not the same as understanding what it is. Throwing around buzzwords is an easy way to fake understanding to others, but it's impossible to be creative or have any fun if all you can do is mix and match buzzwords.Never stop playing. Remember why you enjoyed physics (or whichever field) in the first place; it's fun to play with ideas! No administrator or scientific colleague is ever going to ask you to spend more time playing, but that is often crucial to coming up with new ideas as well as having fun."
244,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,5,I really enjoyed this book and learning about this man. Just the kind of guy one would love to have as a friend. Such curiosity. Such lack of pretension! Marvelously enjoyable book. 
245,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"A while back, I read another book by Feynman, The Pleasure of Finding Things Out, and I wasn't all that thrilled with it. It was kind of disappointing at the time. I knew that Feynman's fame came not only from his scientific brilliance, but from the fact that he was a genuinely interesting, funny and mischievous person. I had hoped that I could find some of that in the book, but to no avail. And so I gave it away so that someone else could get the pleasure from it that I could not.Still, I was not completely turned off Feynman. There are videos of him around the internet that really show his vibrancy, his energy and the passion with which he approached the world, and I knew there would come a time when I would have to give him a second chance. Thus, this book.Surely You're Joking, Mister Feynman! is the story - or rather a collection of stories - about what can happen to a person with immense confidence in his own abilities, an insatiable curiosity about the world, a willingness to make mistakes, all topped off with a generous helping of genius.First, as Feynman calls them at the beginning of the book, some vitals. Richard Feynman was a theoretical physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project, taught at Caltech, and won the Nobel Prize in physics for his contributions to quantum electrodynamics. He was also one hell of a bongo player, an accomplished artist, and a self-taught safecracker. He was a joker and a prankster and a ladies' man who could bluff his way into pretty much anything he wanted to do, and was often surprised that people believed his bravado. He had a passion for mysteries and puzzles and figuring out how things worked, from combination locks to the movements of electrons to why water curves the way it does when it comes out the tap, and he didn't give a good goddamn about what the rest of the world thought of him.In other words, Richard Feynman was a pretty awesome guy.This book is a collection of Feynman's stories, the kind that he might tell at a party or with a bunch of friends traveling. They're the variety of story that might begin with, ""Did I ever tell you how I joined a samba band in Rio?"" and just go on from there. He starts with his youth, how he was the kind of boy who just loved to tinker with things. He would take electronics apart and put them back together, and then go to junk shops to buy parts that he could build into better radios. He did experiments with ants to find out how they communicated, and dedicated himself so hard to solving puzzles that eventually all he needed was the first line, and he could immediately come back with, ""He starts by chopping every other one in three parts.""He was one of those kids whose curiosity was boundless, and who never even imagined that there was anything ""better"" he could have been doing than exploring how the world worked. I couldn't shake the feeling that if young Feynman were around today, he'd be medicated to the eyeballs just to stop him being so ""weird."" But you know me. Cynic.We follow him through his days at MIT, pulling pranks with friends and discovering those interesting weaknesses in human thought processes that allowed him to get away with murder when he was young. His habits of wondering how things work carried him through his participation in the Manhattan Project, his travels to countries like Brazil and Japan, and led him through a life that was never without fascinating and entertaining discoveries.Long story short (too late), Feynman is - or at least should be - a model for young people today. While the book isn't pitched towards young people, there are several lessons in it that should be taught to every child.The first is that the world is infinitely interesting. Any kid who whines that she is bored needs to be shown the million and one ways that you can combat boredom just within a ten-foot radius of where you're sitting. Look at something - anything and ask yourself, ""I wonder how that works,"" and then go find out. The possibilities are endless, and the potential exists that you may discover a passion you never knew you had. Feynman didn't start out wondering how electrons work - he fixed his neighbors' radios just because he could. One thing led to another, and next thing you know - BAM! Nobel Prize.The second point, and it is connected to the first, is to never say No. In his essay, ""But Is It Art?"" he talks about how he learned to draw. It started when an artist friend offered to teach Feynman how to draw if he would teach the artist about science. While Feynman believed that he would be an absolutely atrocious artist, he still agreed to the challenge, and he stuck with it. Eventually he became well-known as a decent artist, even managing to sell some of his works. Now obviously, there are limits and caveats to ""never"" - there are times when saying No is the right thing to do. But when you find an opportunity to expand your abilities, to learn new things and face new challenges, the automatic ""No"" may deprive you of a joy that you never knew you could experience.Third, you must know who you are. One of the problems inherent in living in a society is that there's always someone trying to tell you who you are, or at least who you should be. Your parents, teachers, friends, all have an image of you in their heads, and are all trying to mold you into that image, consciously or unconsciously. Add to that the government, media, corporations, advertisements, shysters, preachers and other deliverers of hokum and propaganda who are also trying to tell you who you really are, despite having never met you and being pretty sure that you don't already know yourself. And many people, sadly, don't. But Feynman did. He knew who he was, and that was all he needed. He occasionally let people think differently about him, but the thread that runs through this book is a rock-solid self-awareness that allowed him the self-confidence to pick up showgirls or try to turn down a Nobel Prize.The caveat to this, and a corollary to the second point, is that you can always discover new things about who you are. All through the book, we see Feynman faced with a new opportunity that he thinks he can't do because it's just Not Him. Drawing, playing music, learning languages - those skills didn't fit into the mental model of who he thought he was, a flaw that all of us possess. A lot of us, without even giving it a try, might immediately discard something by saying, ""Well, that's just not me."" Maybe it could be. It takes courage, and the willingness to fall flat on your face, but if you can discover a new talent or a new passion, isn't it worth it?Finally, remember that everyone else around you is just as human as you are. Don't be impressed by titles and uniforms, fancy suits and impressive business cards. Don't assume that just because someone wears a soldier's uniform or a thousand dollar suit that they are somehow ""better"" than you. Feynman not only resisted authority in so many of these tales, he actively worked to subvert it. Whether it's trying to sneak codes past military censors or breaking into the safe that held all the secrets of the atomic bomb, he never let a title get in the way of learning or growing.One of my favorite Feynman stories related to this last point isn't actually in this book, but I'll mention it anyway. After the Challenger disaster back in 1986, NASA was called on the carpet to explain to Congress why their shiny new space shuttle went Kaboom. The NASA managers went on and on about the O-rings, filling their talk with supercilious jargon and doublespeak, hoping that their haughty attitudes and impenetrable explanations of why the cold weather made the O-rings fail would be comprehensible enough to satisfy the committee, yet obtuse enough to avoid actually admitting that they had done anything wrong. While they were doing this, Feynman put a piece of the O-ring material into a glass of ice water and let it sit there for a while. Then he took it out, stretched it, and showed that it had lost the pliability that it needed to do its job. With a simple demonstration, he not only showed the fault that led to the Challenger explosion, but at the same time put a bunch of self-aggrandizing stuffed shirts in their places.I love that story.Anyway, if you're looking for a Feynman book to read - and who isn't? - this is the one to start with. There's not much hard talk about science in it, just lots of stories about a really interesting guy. Even if it doesn't make you want to get into quantum electrodynamic theory, I hope it still makes you look at the world in a different way."

250,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,1,"I totally agree with Emily, the top reviewer with 113 comments, most of them chastising her for not loving this book, and many of them trying to imply she's simply not smart enough to appreciate Feynman if she doesn't love it. Without attempting to demean or diminish Feynman's actual brilliance and greatness as a scientist, I declare: this book is annoying as shit. Without dismissing the many very real talents Mr. Feynman had, I'm not convinced that compelling and empathetic writing was one of them. I'm aware this book is little more than a compilation of interviews with Feynman, so perhaps the blame there lies with his co-author/editor, who took Feynman too much at his literal word and failed to effectively work the many anecdotes into a pleasing and well-written whole. I'm told Feynman was a very likeable guy, but the guy who comes across in these anecdotes seems to me to be only likeable in small doses. He seems bombastic, overbearing, even a bit grandiose in his manner, despite paying lip service to modesty – and by this, I don't just mean he spends too much time bragging about how clever he is, which he also does. Don't bother dinging me for saying this by pointing out that he IS pretty goddamn clever and has earned some bragging rights - I'm aware of that, and I don't care. He could be the smartest person in the history of the world, but braggadocio is still not an attractive habit. And don't try to tell me it's an essential quality of an autobiography, either. I've read other autobiographies where people spend upward of 300 pages talking about themselves without making me want to punt them.No, I sense something deeper in Feynman's manner of speaking that says to me, This person is utterly arrogant and yes, self-aggrandizing. (Emily's word.) It strikes me as the sound of someone who's spent too much of his life with his fanboys hanging on his every word, so that now he thinks every word that comes out of his mouth is actually worth hanging on. This may be a justifiable mistake for someone in Feynman's position, but that doesn't make it any less a mistake. In fact, I think it's a mistake that is at the heart of this book – the concept of, “It's Feynman, so of COURSE we can just compile a bunch of interviews with him about random shit he did one time, put them in chronological order, and it'll be great!”And I don't find Feynman nearly as funny, endearing, or even interesting as he thinks he is. To be fair, I admit he seems from afar like a terribly interesting man, but I quickly discovered I do NOT want to spend 11 solid hours listening to him tell seemingly random and generally trivial stories about episodes in his life. One or two anecdotes may be mildly entertaining, but his style gets old in a hurry, and his sense of humor seems downright mean-spirited at times. Perhaps my mistake was in attempting to vread it straight through – I don't really have any other way to vread. But you can only vread so many anecdotes about experimenting with ants and their pheromone trails or working on broken radios as a kid before you realize each one may be slightly interesting, but when you put them all together in a row, their total interest value doesn't accumulate. Meanwhile, Feynman's annoyance value DOES. Therefore, I recommend this book (a) in small doses, say for example as light bedtime reading, or (b) for those on the “Feynman can do no wrong” bandwagon. This latter group is his true audience – the ones who are delighted to hang on every word that comes out of his mouth. And I suspect that in the latter half of his life, he moved through a world so surrounded by those people that he forgot there was anything else. I could be wrong – maybe it's not Feynman's fault at all, and this isn't really him. This could be just the aspect of him that's been asked to sit down in front of a microphone and tell every story about himself that he can think of. When your friends tell you that your war stories are so awesome they should be compiled and published as a book, is there any other way it can really come out?Audio notes: The audio version is not helped by a narrator who seems to be sort of channeling Feynman's manner of speaking – his rhythms and intonations, though not his accent or timbre – and it makes a slightly annoying series of anecdotes that much MORE annoying and somewhat duller than the material itself would warrant. I pulled up recordings of Feynman's lectures and more casual interviews, and there's enough of a match to his casual speech patterns that I think it's intentional. But it's as though the narrator learned to imitate Feynman by listening to him speak a single sentence, and then he just repeats that sentence over and over. Every sentence has the exact same rhythm and intonation as the one before it, and it's all a little too fast and perky, so it's like being forced to spend 11 hours listening to a salesman's patter. Somewhere between that and Chinese water torture."
251,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3764819-barb,2,"The subtitle of this book is ""Adventures of a Curious Character."" I would definitely say that Richard Feynman is curious--the probably one thing I liked about him was his interest is exploring the world beyond just the physics he specialized in. He worked with biologists when he could've worked with physicists; he tried out deprivation tanks. He pushed himself to learn new languages and paint and get out of his comfort zone. That's admirable.However. The man was insufferable. This book, which is largely a series of stories he told to a friend in a very informal manner, is anecdote after anecdote of him saying, essentially, how much better he was than others. How his was the right way of thinking. He would try to be self-deprecating, but it inevitably wound up as ""But it turned out I was the most awesome!"" Stories tended to go something like, ""Some really smart people were talking about something. I'm such an idiot, and didn't know anything about that topic, but threw out an idea that sprang to mind, because I'm too stupid not to say whatever I'm thinking. And then they lit up! 'What a great idea!' they said. It was really just luck that it happened that way."" Repeat ad infinitum. Some of his stories from his childhood were interesting--and the book is probably best read in brief snippets, so the ego doesn't overwhelm you. But he lost me when relaying the story of putting a waitress's tip under an upside-down full glass of water. And he remained proud of himself for that. The man was not nice. He wasn't a good guy. He didn't feel the need to contribute to the common good. He had zero problems making others' lives miserable, like when he agreed to give a class at a local college, provided he only had to fill out so many forms. Turned out, it required one more form than originally agreed-upon, but instead of just signing it, he made the poor college employee go to what Feynman himself describes as a lot of trouble just to not fill out the form. And he refused to submit receipts for reimbursement (though at least there he accepted that that meant he wouldn't get the money).This isn't even getting into his stories about women.The book wasn't all bad. Like I said, Feynman had some redeeming qualities. He's someone who would be interesting to chat with for a few minutes at a party. But ultimately, as good as he may have been at science and as many interesting stories he may have had, Dick Feynman is not someone I want to spend more time with."
252,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67794375-david,3,"Richard Feynman understood physics. His reader, the cerebral and equally pulchritudinous, david, knows not a thing about physics. Okay, that is not true. “Things fall when you drop them,” I have observed, time and again. Therefore, I have an aptitude for science.I can relate.This guy won a Nobel Prize, hung with Einstein and Oppenheimer, and discovered and documented events that I do not feel like sharing, mostly because I cannot.I, unlike Feynman, garnered a trophy in wrestling. An unusual one. I was one of the few kids on any high school grappling team to have viewed the ceilings of each tournament visited (that is not a good thing in this sport). And it was not by design, but by ambivalence. If at first, you do not succeed, no one really cares. I did not know any scientists, but I did occasion ‘Feinstein & Schloppenheimer’s Deli.’ Ah, the pastrami on rye, you could just die, literally. And still, like every solid American who has learned not to enjoy anything ‘too much,’ I ripened into a vegan decades ago. Go figure. Please pass the Kombucha.A very interesting story, this was. Feynman had his tale to tell and it was atypical. He was one of the architects in the development of the nuclear bomb and was an instructor and/or a student at MIT, Caltech, Cornell, and other top schools. His take on academia for a lifetime, with a IQ that could travel the autobahn but not I-80, makes for some funny moments.He had the corny sense of humor you would expect from a full-time scientist. And much of it made for an enjoyable read, although I go deaf when it comes to jokes that include numbers.So, in conclusion, I would like to thank the members of the Academy, my school teachers who assuaged my youth with ‘C’s rather than ‘F’s and the good people of the Seychelles. Pax vobiscum and give my regards to Broadway."

Very natural, very rich, inspiring and, well, what I enjoyed the most of course, his views of life felt often times aligned with mine, so what's not to love about that? :PThis is a man who knew how to live and how to find beauty in everything he did. His strong curiosity is what makes a difference between a great person who can create whatever he sets his mind on doing, and a random person who simply knows facts about art/science/news but can't use them to create or really understand anything whatsoever.The book is funny and clever. I absolutely loved it and will surely read it again at some point in my life!Here are some quotes that I really connected with:""And, just like it should in all stories about philosophers, it ended up in complete chaos.""""There were a lot of fools at the conference - pompous fools - and pompous fools drive me up the wall. Ordinary fools are all right; you can talk to them, and try to help them out. But pompous fools - guys who are fools and are covering it all over and impressing people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus - that, I cannot stand!""""[...] I was in Italy for a science conference and I thought I'd like to see the Sistine Chapel. I got there very early in the morning, bought my ticket before anybody else, and ran up the stairs as soon as the place opened.

254,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42787747-thinn,4,"I really like how human he is in this book. There was no heroic moment he mentioned about himself and he even admitted his mistakes! He was very curious. He was curious in almost all the area and he picked at them so quick especially in arts! He was good at arts and music.I also like the part where he talked about ants. He redirect the ants’ route. When I was young, my sister and I did a bit experiment about ants too! I would say he is mischievous at the offices. Messing around with people about safe! I want to hear more about his colleagues point of view too.  He reminds me of Forrest Gump. Both of them were so curious about everything and good at whatever they put foot in it. Here are a few quotes that I like from the book. The last one was from the speech from Caltech commencement in 1974. ‘Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that’s the end of you.’ ‘The first principle is that you must not fool yourself- and you are the easiest person to fool.’ ‘So I have just one wish for you- the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of Inter gritty I have described, and and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.’ The only thing I don’t like about him is his involvement of Manhattan Project. "
255,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/436784-leippya,5,"A fascinating read, and also surprisingly hilarious! I didn't expect to burst out laughing while reading the autobiography of a physicist but that's what ended up happening -- Feynman definitely was a first class prankster! Although physics are often mentioned, you don't need to really know about it to be able to enjoy the book; this is more about his life than his work. It's a joy to read about how much this man enjoys learning, not only physics but also music (bongo player!), painting and so on. Makes you just want to learn those things you've been postponing for a while. I cringed a bit at the way most women are represented in the book, but if that's how the women he met really were, there's nothing really to do about it, you can't rewrite history.I would really advise everybody to read this book. Feynman is a Nobel Prize winner, worked on the atomic bomb and is such an interesting and funny person to read about. Really, what I'm going to remember most from this book is how thoroughly that guy enjoyed life and embraced any challenge he set his mind on."
256,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2646348-natalie,5,"This should be made compulsory in school. At a very basic level as a collection of humorous anecdotes and zany adventures, it already deserves 5 stars, but it is so much more than just a funny book. There is plenty of serious insight and we are so fortunate to have a glimpse into Feynman's ingenious childlike mind. Reading it brings me real comfort to know I'm on the right track - that it's right to remain intellectually curious, that there's fun in learning, that you should always go back to first principles, and that you should never lose any intellectual integrity. So it is baffling and disheartening to see some bad reviews. To anyone who sees this book as self-aggrandizing, you're completely missing the point and I hope you stay a rare breed. But I'm open to hearing you out and I would be grateful if you could share your reasons because I'm just not seeing it at all. My only regret is that I didn't read this sooner, but better late than never. "
257,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5547564-david,5,"Simply put: To date, it is the most thoroughly enjoyable memoir I have ever read! I love Feynman's accounts of his life, of his interminable curiosity, of his brilliance, of his determination to never say ""I can't do this"" and keep at it until he learned, whether it was physics (for which he won the Nobel Prize), learning Portugese, learning to draw, learning to socialize in a bar, learning drums. So inspirational and full of Feynman's very humorous wit throughout. I loved every minute of this!! For audiobook listeners, Raymond Todd absolutely nails the correct tone!"
258,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14875421-anna,5,"It's one of those books after which you think: WHAT? I can only give 5 stars to it?And then you think you should give every other book less stars, because they are not as awesome as this one.And THEN you think about the inspiring character this book is about and that he is such a positive person and never would give other people get less, just because he is so awesome. And then you are just sad that the book is over and thankful that you could read it : ) "
259,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27248823-vishal,5,"How much do you think a person can do in a single lifetime despite having a dedicated attachment to the ever-demanding(and boring, according to laypeople) field of Theoretical Physics?He can learn to make good enough paintings to be shown in an one-man exhibition. He can learn to play Bongo well enough to be included in street competition in pre-carnival seasons in a city of Brazil. He can play drums for a Ballet which would win a national level award. He can learn to crack safes and pick locks which would give him a reputation all over his work arena. He can make reliable observations and conclusions by practicing hallucination, analyzing dreams by falling in and out of sleep, by making an experiment on ants and showing their lack of sense of geometry. He can learn many languages. He can get drunk every now and then in bars and pick up girls. He can stop drinking at once when he wishes to. Despite all of this, he can still win a Nobel Prize.Richard Feynman, the coolest Physicist ever, shows you the vast array of possibilities to consider and explore if you begin with a child-like curiousity about the world and don't let it fade away with passing years of your life. Before reading this book, I was little apprehensive about what I am supposed to do in life if I like so many things and am afraid to pick up one because I don't want losing my other fields of interest. So one of the greatest teachers, Feynman, showed me the way that if you remain curious and manage your time, you can pursue whatever you want.This book of anecdotes might seem a little exaggerating and annoying to some people, who altogether miss the idea of the lessons the author is trying to propagate. One of the reviews on Goodreads says that, the book is full of arrogance and how Feynman is showing off his skills at so many things and taking pride in himself. I pity the poor reviewer who missed the point that how Feynman is not showing that ""I could do it"", he is showing that ""it can be done by you too"". So much rant for the ignorant laypeople.Inspite of the anecdotes about Feynman ""having fun"", the most important parts of this book to be circulated and popularized are his views on pseudo-science and scientific integrity. He experimented with much of pseudo-science including psychics, hallucinations and dream-interpretations and explained the scientific side of those phenomena. He explained how ignorant people are fooled by the practitioners of pseudo-science. About his remarks on scientific integrity, it is a must read for anyone who wishes to pursue science, and it should be read by laypeople too so that they could see how science works and why is it preferable to any cult of faith believe system. He explains the importance of experiments and shows you to be patient with them in the part about his experiments on ants.""You are not obliged to be what others expect you ought to be. If you don't be what they want you to be, it's a failing of their judgement, not your own."" A quote that could be misinterpreted too, but it would be clear when one knows the context in which Feynman said those words. After the death of his first wife and returning from the Nuclear bomb project, he was depressed and had a sense of loss of his zeal for Physics. He was teaching Physics but he didn't think he was making enough contribution to research according to what was expected of him. That's when he explains how he stopped caring and started to play with Science for the love of it. He started with a trivial experiment of analyzing spinning plates and this lead to the ideas in Quantam Physics which later won him the Nobel Prize. The story of recovering is impressive and inspiring, if my elaborations here don't make a convincing case for it then I suggest you to take my word for it and read the part.In conclusion, this is one of the books which you can include in your list of 'Life-changing books'. You can read it again and again, everytime you'll learn something new. Everytime the book will offer a new perspective onto life. Everytime, you'll see how to live a life that is full of Life. "

Incredible passion to science and asking simple question 'why' on all the surrounding things. The relation to the system of education and science in the world of memorising the facts and past discoveries can be summarised in the following quote: ""I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something"""
261,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"It seems only natural to begin my thoughts on this book with a quote from Feynman :The first principle is that you must not fool yourself. And you are the easiest person to fool. These words capture the essence of what formed Feynman's portrait. Someone who questioned all the established notions and believed in science to be ultimately a trial and error method to arrive at the truth. His is a first rate scientific mind that never stops at anything unless he arrives at a conclusion that is satisfying and in accordance with common sense. What makes him different is the fact that he does not stop here but goes one step further to ensure that he does communicate this in the most simplest fashion possible. It is a book long glimpse to the mind of a funny, intelligent and humane persona that made up Richard Feynman.What strikes you most about him is his utter lack of pretension. For a man who won a Nobel, worked on the Manhattan project and has a string of achievements in the field of physics to his credit, he is entirely unassuming. He assumes the same air of fun and gaiety in discussing the Manhattan project as he does on how to flirt with the showgirls in Vegas. This is a no holds barred account of his life and a detailed elucidation on some of his thoughts and perspectives. If I was asked to pick what stood out of this book, I would pick the attribute of curiosity. You do not need a sharp mind to pick out the number of times he tinkers around to find the underlying truths all because it got him curious. The second aspect is that he never shied away from learning all through his life. From what I can recollect right now, he went along and studied how to make music at a Brazilian Carnival, how to gamble like a high roller, how to play bongo drums, how to be interesting to women without emptying your pocket in the process and so on. If you look at these things he learned, they have nothing to do with science but that never stopped him. All that mattered to him was the learning and how to be good at what you learn. It baffled me to see that he could manage to learn so much in one single lifetime. Feynman was never the highbrow kind to spurn all these as beneath him but he embraced all these as the little things that make our World fun to live in. Feynman was above everything else an epitome of irreverence. Social niceties never sat well with him and he was the kind to call a spade its real name, in the loudest way possible no matter what the occasion was . Bureaucracy was what suffered his wrath the most through pranks and vociferous protests. Here is what he had to say about the ruling elite and its policies :  I know it is the way the Government works ; well screw the Government ! I feel that human beings should treat human beings like human beings. And unless I am treated like one, I'm not going to have anything to do with them.  These acts of rebelliousness chose to make him a kind of social pariah, but Feynman being Feynman cared not two hoots about it !This is no biography but an exploration of things that caught his interest from everything ranging from Mayan hieroglyphics and quarks to hallucinations and good looking girls. A very interesting set of anecdotes about a rather unique human being. Recommended. "
262,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"The Most Fascinating ManI just met the most fascinating man in my life – just finished reading “Surely You Must be Joking Mr. Feynman”. Here is a man who is probably one of the brightest that ever walked on this planet. A person who was relentlessly curious, and not just about his own craft, but about almost everything he encountered. An incredibly mischievous person who took nothing very seriously, but at the same time took everything seriously enough to explore passionately. Feynman was obsessed with solving problems, and not just in Physics but anything that he took interest in, and that’s a very large universe from machines to drumming, from school education to picking up women in a bar, from art to Mayan hieroglyphics. Above all, he was a man who was irreverent towards all ideas until it made complete sense to him.What bothered Feynman the most was people’s lack of deep understanding of what they believe they understand. Most of us believe we understand a few things, especially things that relate to our professions, but do we really? Most of us have a very superficial sense of things that we know, which may be adequate to waddle through our jobs and our life, but the kind of deep understanding that Feynman is referring to, where everything fits together and makes perfect sense, where one is capable of explaining to another individual with perfect clarity, is mostly missing. Even more dangerous is that fact that most of us are not even aware how muddled our understandings are. Most of us, as individuals, and sometimes entire professions, suffer from this grand illusion without ever being challenged.I wish I read this book many decades earlier, because there was a possibility that it could have changed my life. I believe it should be a must-read for all young people, especially those that plan to take up a scientific, or for that matter, any intellectual profession. Looking back at my childhood, I had very similar curiosities as Feynman, and like him I spent most of my time tinkering with things and exploring everything from fire to ants and from machines to questions like why we find something musical. However, I was not even nearly as smart, but more importantly, I did not have his perseverance. Many of us are curious when we are young, but intellectual laziness prevents us from exploring them adequately. Most of us also lack the spirit to challenge all ideas that came from authority sources. To Feynman, every idea had to make perfect sense to him, and until then he simply would not accept them. I, on the other hand, grew up with values that tried to convince me that having some “beliefs” is a virtue. These beliefs did not come as religious or social dictates but more as moral and political wisdom, and I convinced my young mind that I am making perfectly rational choices. The funny thing is, if you asked me when I was in my teens or twenties. I would have proclaimed the same mindset that Feynman had, except I really did not practice it. What a remarkable human being – almost unbelievable! I have never met or seen Feynman. Once I stood just outside his office door in CalTech. I have been extremely lucky to have met and spent time with his close friend and colleague Murray Gell-Mann, who is often mentioned in this book. Another astounding mind…"
263,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31318644-ankit-kumar,5,"Well, another autobiographical book which I loved very much. This time it is from a visionary whom I have admired for a long time, without knowing much about his work and life. This book gives a such an honest account of the life of Feynman, that too by himself. You will never read a better book by someone like this. The title of the book does full justice to the material inside the book, right from the first page. Feynman pens down all of his adventures in life which revolves around his passion- ""Physics"". And other stuff that he learned and talked because he was curious about them. He was a person, who will not accept something just by hearing it or just by looking at it from face value, He would go great length to understand the reason behind them, by himself. After much thought and deliberation, he will accept it with full integrity and fight for it, or reject it forthright and will continue to do so without fearing the consequences. There is so much to learn from the character of Feynman. I cannot do justice by writing about that in this review, but you ought to read it and understand it and feel it yourself. Do read this book, you will have so much fun reading about his adventures and also sound reasons behind them. This book has so many complex concepts, phenomena are discussed with such humility and simplicity, and without any pretence that only Feynman could have (or I have read till date about in a person). The last few paragraphs of the book, in which Feynman gives advice about how to maintain integrity in scientific pursuit by anyone, and take full responsibility of what you are doing and why you are doing so, particularly given me so much to think about my own practice and future in science. I would like to finish this review by quoting Feynman, from this book, which I found very inspirational and something which we should think about all the time in our lives. "" You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.""~ Richard P. Feynman(Surely you're joking Mr Feynman)"

One day I gave it three stars and another five. I should think that it certainly deserves five stars in that it is one of the few books that delve into the mind of a genius and gives some idea to their thought process's. My desire to write a review of this book are threefold:I was stationed in Orlando Florida and it was mandatory that we watch the liftoff's.After the Challenger shuttle disaster I worked for a woman who did quality assurance for repairs on US Polaris ballistic missile systems who worked with the same seals that failed on the shuttle disaster. Long before the results were published by the investigation team she met Mr. Feynman on a flight to duty stations. In their exchange he asked her what she thought was the problem and told him without a doubt it was the seals. Reagan the president at the time this disaster had exerted pressure to launch the Challenger in the overly cold weather. I also watched the media's involvement and unneeded sensationalism about the delays that undoubtedly provoked a too hasty decision to launch. I have read many management studies attributing this debacle as a legacy of the decision making process called Groupthink. As this can only be so and knowledge of the affects of cold on the seals was widely know in professional circles and also at NASA it must be surmised that we have a warped decision making system in place in our government.The lightness that Feynman's stories give to the seriousness of his academic career must only be surmised as a way of dealing with his knowledge of how many problems the Earth is facing in part due to our faulty decision making. It was driven home after watching a video about his life where I was almost brought to tears... The must see video is The Quest For Tannu Tuva[1988] which seemed to be more widely shown in the UK than in the US.Let's learn from Feynman."

There's very little new material in it and it's less detailed.Despite that, it is still a fantastic read. For anyone who hasn't read The Pleasure of Finding Things Out then pick this book up and get reading!As a scientist, I can tell you that Richard Feynman's Horizon episode from 1981 - from the transcripts of which, much of this book is taken - is one the main reasons I became a research scientist. I've watched it a million times. This book is the written form of that. It's a perfect description of what it really is to know something. Of how to accurately determine something - not just in science but in everyday life. It also serves as guide to not succumbing to the many and varied pitfalls of poor thinking. It is a very human account of a man who, even to other great scientists, seemed god-like in his intellect, how that man and that intellect came to be and how oddly achievable it seems (though of course you know it can never be for us mere mortals).From a more shallow perspective, this book is a series of witty anecdotes about a scientific genius of the 20th century that anyone can enjoy. "
266,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12973215-danny-tyran,3,"Feynman is/was (is he still alive?) brilliant, but he knew it too much. I dislike people too proud of themselves.The story line of this book is simple:1. Feynman begins something new (new course, new job, any other activity)2. He finds a way to improve some piece of equipment or some process (working process,...)3. A few people tell him that he is a genius and accept to change things (equipment or process) and most of the others resist the change suggested by Feynman4. Go to 1 and do it all again.There are some funny parts. But I'd lie if I told you that I understood everything that the author explained. Even at the very beginning, Feynman was a little boy who repaired TVs and radios for his family and for neighbors. Who still understand how worked apparels with lamps? I can't even imagine that electric devices could work that way. All I know is that sometimes the lamps burned out and you had to change them, but what if it was not a burned-out bulb that caused the problem? The author explained something that he understood very well by himself when he was around 9 years old. I still don't understand it even with his explanation. :(Anyway, if you like anecdotal stories, probably you'll like this book. I liked it, but I can't tell that I loved it."

Apart from being one hilarious ride with an adventurous theoretical physicist, this book also reminded me of somewhat forgotten ways of learning, thinking and experimenting in life and academics/career. Feynman comes across as an honest, courageous, fun-filled character who had certain child-like innocence and curiosity in his spirit. The writing will make you laugh, wonder and think. Feynman's free-spirited nature, his attitude of questioning status-quo, his insatiable curiosity, his will to step out of his comfort zone and try new and often difficult things is inspiring, to the extent that one would want to break their present monotonous life and set out for their own adventure!This book demands a permanent place in your library and re-reads."

Richard Feynman was a genius with a super inquiring mind that is a hallmark of all great men, but what makes him so unique is that his life didn't just have one dimension. He was curious about so many fields and activities and the way he describes them in this book are so fantastic that you end up wanting to try those things out! "

272,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1224976-julie,1,"Nope, not wasting any more time on this clown. I read up through his chapter on how to neg a woman in order to trick her into sleeping with you and thought ""Yep, I am done. Gave this the good ol' college try but the bad outweighs the good here."" Who knew Feynman, as well as being a brilliant Nobel Prize winning physicist was also the patron saint of the PUA(Pick up artist) community?I am honestly shocked at the number of rave reviews this collection of personal anecdotes has. I assume people are blinded by Feynman's intellect - which was staggering - and his joyful attitude towards learning for learning's sake. Perhaps if I had read a biography of Feynman, written by someone else, I wouldn't have had such a negative reaction to him?It seemed obvious to me, both as a former SPED teacher and as the parent of someone on the autistic spectrum, that Feynman had undiagnosed Asperger's Syndrome. He often mentions his inability to understand social cues and to interact successfully with others. His story of using other people's nervous laughter as a clue that his behavior was incorrect was telling. He couldn't tell by unspoken body language or facial expressions or tone of voice - he needed actual tittering laughter to signal that he needed to adjust his behavior. Feynman used his prodigious intellect to help him work around his deficits in social behavior but often it wasn't enough.The first painful story was that of the waitress and the tip. Oh wow. Even when telling the story, years later, he has no idea how egregious his behavior was. He pulled the juvenile trick of leaving the tip as coins with a full glass of water on top. Two glasses with the coins split between them. Just what a busy server in a restaurant wants to deal with. To add insult to injury, this was a restaurant he went to daily & a waitress that often served him. This is how he repays her for doing a good job. His motivation for being a jerk? He wanted to see if she would be able to figure out how to get her tip without making a big mess, though how he would know this is unclear, since he wasn't there when she attempted it. He returns the next day to find everyone angry at him & the waitress refusing to interact with him anymore. She didn't have time for his intellectual query - since, you know, she had an actual job she needed to be doing - and the water spilled everywhere & that made extra work for her, cleaning his mess up, and then later she slipped & hurt herself on the still damp floor. Feynman has no clue that he has done anything wrong & can't figure out why people are upset. Then - get this - HE DOES IT AGAIN WITH THE NEW WAITRESS SERVING HIM. Hardy har har, ain't he a hoot?He tells many stories like this, where he is a complete asshole to people. He can't understand why people don't trust him and think he is a liar. One thing he enjoyed doing was pretending to be drunk when he wasn't - ugh, insert big eye roll here - because, I don't know honestly. Because he has no understanding of human emotions and common reactions?I stopped reading after the anecdote about how he is a nice guy but woman still won't have sex with him - can't they see how nice he is, damn it?! - so he meets a guy who teaches him the trick is to treat women like whores and bitches. "" I adopted the attitude that those girls are all bitches, that they aren't worth anything, and that all they're in there for is to get you to buy them a drink, and they're not going to give you a goddamn thing. I'm not going to be a gentleman to such worthless bitches and so on. I learned it till it was automatic.""A good reminder that just because someone is an intellectual genius or has an amazing artistic talent or incredible physical prowess doesn't make them a decent or even likable person. People tend to ascribe positive characteristics to successful people whether they are truly worthy of them or not. Feynman is a good example of this."
273,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,2,"The bits on doing physics are interesting; the bits on picking up aging tigers in shady New York bars, not so much.This book will likely appeal far more to science fanboys and groupies rather than scientists themselves. The goal of the book seems mostly to convince lay people that scientists are indeed human beings who have hobbies, eat at restaurants, and have sexual intercourse (gasp!). Given that most scientists likely see themselves as human beings, I think the majority of the book would be quite boring for them. I personally far prefer Feynman's nonfiction books and video lectures, which are served crystal-clear with a side of motivation.However, now that I've thoroughly demotivated your wanting to read this book, there are two upsides.First, to a baby scientist (a middle-schooler, high-schooler, or college freshman aspiring to become a scientist), especially one who doesn't come from a family of scientists or hasn't met many in their life, this book is a much more inspirational look at the life of an (atypical) scientist than the Wikipedia entry on scientist. That said, if you know a youngling leaning towards a life scientific, this is a great (dangerous?) book to pass along to them.Second, hidden amongst the fluff are stellar pieces of advice for doing science, what I will refer to as ""Feynmanisms."" Most aren't explicit but are simply what I interpreted from Feynman's stories on doing science. Here's a list of my favorites:Seek people and ideas outside your own field. There's a great pressure in science to confine yourself to one field. This pressure comes from funding agencies and administrators who must be able to easily define which discipline your work is in, as well as from interactions with other scientists in your field, who will of course mostly suggest ideas and insights from within that field. Resist this pressure. Speak with scientists in either fields about their ideas and your own. Seek connections. It will often be hard to communicate but its always worth the effort.Don't be afraid to ask questions. Many a student or scientist finds himself at the end of a long lecture, completely lost because he didn't have the courage to ask what a word on the second slide meant. Get over it. You are and will always be a student and there will always be things you don't know.Think in examples. It's easy to get lost if you think about every new concept you learn in terms of another new concept you only learned ten minutes ago. Yet this is often the way books try to teach. Instead, when trying to follow an explanation, think in a concrete example and add features slowly. It might be ""faster"" to use jargon and buzzwords to explain a concept, but there's no use in this compression if you don't understand what's going on.Don't fool yourself into thinking you know something you don't. It is surprisingly easy to convince the human brain that it understands something that it most certainly does not. Knowing the name of something is not the same as understanding what it is. Throwing around buzzwords is an easy way to fake understanding to others, but it's impossible to be creative or have any fun if all you can do is mix and match buzzwords.Never stop playing. Remember why you enjoyed physics (or whichever field) in the first place; it's fun to play with ideas! No administrator or scientific colleague is ever going to ask you to spend more time playing, but that is often crucial to coming up with new ideas as well as having fun."
274,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,5,I really enjoyed this book and learning about this man. Just the kind of guy one would love to have as a friend. Such curiosity. Such lack of pretension! Marvelously enjoyable book. 
275,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"A while back, I read another book by Feynman, The Pleasure of Finding Things Out, and I wasn't all that thrilled with it. It was kind of disappointing at the time. I knew that Feynman's fame came not only from his scientific brilliance, but from the fact that he was a genuinely interesting, funny and mischievous person. I had hoped that I could find some of that in the book, but to no avail. And so I gave it away so that someone else could get the pleasure from it that I could not.Still, I was not completely turned off Feynman. There are videos of him around the internet that really show his vibrancy, his energy and the passion with which he approached the world, and I knew there would come a time when I would have to give him a second chance. Thus, this book.Surely You're Joking, Mister Feynman! is the story - or rather a collection of stories - about what can happen to a person with immense confidence in his own abilities, an insatiable curiosity about the world, a willingness to make mistakes, all topped off with a generous helping of genius.First, as Feynman calls them at the beginning of the book, some vitals. Richard Feynman was a theoretical physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project, taught at Caltech, and won the Nobel Prize in physics for his contributions to quantum electrodynamics. He was also one hell of a bongo player, an accomplished artist, and a self-taught safecracker. He was a joker and a prankster and a ladies' man who could bluff his way into pretty much anything he wanted to do, and was often surprised that people believed his bravado. He had a passion for mysteries and puzzles and figuring out how things worked, from combination locks to the movements of electrons to why water curves the way it does when it comes out the tap, and he didn't give a good goddamn about what the rest of the world thought of him.In other words, Richard Feynman was a pretty awesome guy.This book is a collection of Feynman's stories, the kind that he might tell at a party or with a bunch of friends traveling. They're the variety of story that might begin with, ""Did I ever tell you how I joined a samba band in Rio?"" and just go on from there. He starts with his youth, how he was the kind of boy who just loved to tinker with things. He would take electronics apart and put them back together, and then go to junk shops to buy parts that he could build into better radios. He did experiments with ants to find out how they communicated, and dedicated himself so hard to solving puzzles that eventually all he needed was the first line, and he could immediately come back with, ""He starts by chopping every other one in three parts.""He was one of those kids whose curiosity was boundless, and who never even imagined that there was anything ""better"" he could have been doing than exploring how the world worked. I couldn't shake the feeling that if young Feynman were around today, he'd be medicated to the eyeballs just to stop him being so ""weird."" But you know me. Cynic.We follow him through his days at MIT, pulling pranks with friends and discovering those interesting weaknesses in human thought processes that allowed him to get away with murder when he was young. His habits of wondering how things work carried him through his participation in the Manhattan Project, his travels to countries like Brazil and Japan, and led him through a life that was never without fascinating and entertaining discoveries.Long story short (too late), Feynman is - or at least should be - a model for young people today. While the book isn't pitched towards young people, there are several lessons in it that should be taught to every child.The first is that the world is infinitely interesting. Any kid who whines that she is bored needs to be shown the million and one ways that you can combat boredom just within a ten-foot radius of where you're sitting. Look at something - anything and ask yourself, ""I wonder how that works,"" and then go find out. The possibilities are endless, and the potential exists that you may discover a passion you never knew you had. Feynman didn't start out wondering how electrons work - he fixed his neighbors' radios just because he could. One thing led to another, and next thing you know - BAM! Nobel Prize.The second point, and it is connected to the first, is to never say No. In his essay, ""But Is It Art?"" he talks about how he learned to draw. It started when an artist friend offered to teach Feynman how to draw if he would teach the artist about science. While Feynman believed that he would be an absolutely atrocious artist, he still agreed to the challenge, and he stuck with it. Eventually he became well-known as a decent artist, even managing to sell some of his works. Now obviously, there are limits and caveats to ""never"" - there are times when saying No is the right thing to do. But when you find an opportunity to expand your abilities, to learn new things and face new challenges, the automatic ""No"" may deprive you of a joy that you never knew you could experience.Third, you must know who you are. One of the problems inherent in living in a society is that there's always someone trying to tell you who you are, or at least who you should be. Your parents, teachers, friends, all have an image of you in their heads, and are all trying to mold you into that image, consciously or unconsciously. Add to that the government, media, corporations, advertisements, shysters, preachers and other deliverers of hokum and propaganda who are also trying to tell you who you really are, despite having never met you and being pretty sure that you don't already know yourself. And many people, sadly, don't. But Feynman did. He knew who he was, and that was all he needed. He occasionally let people think differently about him, but the thread that runs through this book is a rock-solid self-awareness that allowed him the self-confidence to pick up showgirls or try to turn down a Nobel Prize.The caveat to this, and a corollary to the second point, is that you can always discover new things about who you are. All through the book, we see Feynman faced with a new opportunity that he thinks he can't do because it's just Not Him. Drawing, playing music, learning languages - those skills didn't fit into the mental model of who he thought he was, a flaw that all of us possess. A lot of us, without even giving it a try, might immediately discard something by saying, ""Well, that's just not me."" Maybe it could be. It takes courage, and the willingness to fall flat on your face, but if you can discover a new talent or a new passion, isn't it worth it?Finally, remember that everyone else around you is just as human as you are. Don't be impressed by titles and uniforms, fancy suits and impressive business cards. Don't assume that just because someone wears a soldier's uniform or a thousand dollar suit that they are somehow ""better"" than you. Feynman not only resisted authority in so many of these tales, he actively worked to subvert it. Whether it's trying to sneak codes past military censors or breaking into the safe that held all the secrets of the atomic bomb, he never let a title get in the way of learning or growing.One of my favorite Feynman stories related to this last point isn't actually in this book, but I'll mention it anyway. After the Challenger disaster back in 1986, NASA was called on the carpet to explain to Congress why their shiny new space shuttle went Kaboom. The NASA managers went on and on about the O-rings, filling their talk with supercilious jargon and doublespeak, hoping that their haughty attitudes and impenetrable explanations of why the cold weather made the O-rings fail would be comprehensible enough to satisfy the committee, yet obtuse enough to avoid actually admitting that they had done anything wrong. While they were doing this, Feynman put a piece of the O-ring material into a glass of ice water and let it sit there for a while. Then he took it out, stretched it, and showed that it had lost the pliability that it needed to do its job. With a simple demonstration, he not only showed the fault that led to the Challenger explosion, but at the same time put a bunch of self-aggrandizing stuffed shirts in their places.I love that story.Anyway, if you're looking for a Feynman book to read - and who isn't? - this is the one to start with. There's not much hard talk about science in it, just lots of stories about a really interesting guy. Even if it doesn't make you want to get into quantum electrodynamic theory, I hope it still makes you look at the world in a different way."
276,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93868753-rubel-rana,5,"One of the most beautiful minds in the history of human race was talking to me like a 12 years old boy with full of ebullience.

I didn't even expect that His life round efflorescence beautiful brain and who himself was a harbinger who had knowledge of past also could be this hilarious and this down to earth. I laughed and got astonished that how easily and in a lilt way he handled in the real time and later discussed it in this book of all those imbroglios.Anyway I never write reviews of books, I just simply share my feelings. This was no way more than that. I wish time travel was possible so that I could meet Einstein, Feynman, Carl Sagan, Marie Curie And the love of my life Audrey Hepburn.

277,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5014554-jack,5,"I found myself unable to make fair judgement about: Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a Curious Character. One day I gave it three stars and another five. I should think that it certainly deserves five stars in that it is one of the few books that delve into the mind of a genius and gives some idea to their thought process's. My desire to write a review of this book are threefold:I was stationed in Orlando Florida and it was mandatory that we watch the liftoff's.After the Challenger shuttle disaster I worked for a woman who did quality assurance for repairs on US Polaris ballistic missile systems who worked with the same seals that failed on the shuttle disaster. Long before the results were published by the investigation team she met Mr. Feynman on a flight to duty stations. In their exchange he asked her what she thought was the problem and told him without a doubt it was the seals. Reagan the president at the time this disaster had exerted pressure to launch the Challenger in the overly cold weather. I also watched the media's involvement and unneeded sensationalism about the delays that undoubtedly provoked a too hasty decision to launch. I have read many management studies attributing this debacle as a legacy of the decision making process called Groupthink. As this can only be so and knowledge of the affects of cold on the seals was widely know in professional circles and also at NASA it must be surmised that we have a warped decision making system in place in our government.The lightness that Feynman's stories give to the seriousness of his academic career must only be surmised as a way of dealing with his knowledge of how many problems the Earth is facing in part due to our faulty decision making. It was driven home after watching a video about his life where I was almost brought to tears... The must see video is The Quest For Tannu Tuva[1988] which seemed to be more widely shown in the UK than in the US.Let's learn from Feynman."

280,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,1,"I totally agree with Emily, the top reviewer with 113 comments, most of them chastising her for not loving this book, and many of them trying to imply she's simply not smart enough to appreciate Feynman if she doesn't love it. Without attempting to demean or diminish Feynman's actual brilliance and greatness as a scientist, I declare: this book is annoying as shit. Without dismissing the many very real talents Mr. Feynman had, I'm not convinced that compelling and empathetic writing was one of them. I'm aware this book is little more than a compilation of interviews with Feynman, so perhaps the blame there lies with his co-author/editor, who took Feynman too much at his literal word and failed to effectively work the many anecdotes into a pleasing and well-written whole. I'm told Feynman was a very likeable guy, but the guy who comes across in these anecdotes seems to me to be only likeable in small doses. He seems bombastic, overbearing, even a bit grandiose in his manner, despite paying lip service to modesty – and by this, I don't just mean he spends too much time bragging about how clever he is, which he also does. Don't bother dinging me for saying this by pointing out that he IS pretty goddamn clever and has earned some bragging rights - I'm aware of that, and I don't care. He could be the smartest person in the history of the world, but braggadocio is still not an attractive habit. And don't try to tell me it's an essential quality of an autobiography, either. I've read other autobiographies where people spend upward of 300 pages talking about themselves without making me want to punt them.No, I sense something deeper in Feynman's manner of speaking that says to me, This person is utterly arrogant and yes, self-aggrandizing. (Emily's word.) It strikes me as the sound of someone who's spent too much of his life with his fanboys hanging on his every word, so that now he thinks every word that comes out of his mouth is actually worth hanging on. This may be a justifiable mistake for someone in Feynman's position, but that doesn't make it any less a mistake. In fact, I think it's a mistake that is at the heart of this book – the concept of, “It's Feynman, so of COURSE we can just compile a bunch of interviews with him about random shit he did one time, put them in chronological order, and it'll be great!”And I don't find Feynman nearly as funny, endearing, or even interesting as he thinks he is. To be fair, I admit he seems from afar like a terribly interesting man, but I quickly discovered I do NOT want to spend 11 solid hours listening to him tell seemingly random and generally trivial stories about episodes in his life. One or two anecdotes may be mildly entertaining, but his style gets old in a hurry, and his sense of humor seems downright mean-spirited at times. Perhaps my mistake was in attempting to vread it straight through – I don't really have any other way to vread. But you can only vread so many anecdotes about experimenting with ants and their pheromone trails or working on broken radios as a kid before you realize each one may be slightly interesting, but when you put them all together in a row, their total interest value doesn't accumulate. Meanwhile, Feynman's annoyance value DOES. Therefore, I recommend this book (a) in small doses, say for example as light bedtime reading, or (b) for those on the “Feynman can do no wrong” bandwagon. This latter group is his true audience – the ones who are delighted to hang on every word that comes out of his mouth. And I suspect that in the latter half of his life, he moved through a world so surrounded by those people that he forgot there was anything else. I could be wrong – maybe it's not Feynman's fault at all, and this isn't really him. This could be just the aspect of him that's been asked to sit down in front of a microphone and tell every story about himself that he can think of. When your friends tell you that your war stories are so awesome they should be compiled and published as a book, is there any other way it can really come out?Audio notes: The audio version is not helped by a narrator who seems to be sort of channeling Feynman's manner of speaking – his rhythms and intonations, though not his accent or timbre – and it makes a slightly annoying series of anecdotes that much MORE annoying and somewhat duller than the material itself would warrant. I pulled up recordings of Feynman's lectures and more casual interviews, and there's enough of a match to his casual speech patterns that I think it's intentional. But it's as though the narrator learned to imitate Feynman by listening to him speak a single sentence, and then he just repeats that sentence over and over. Every sentence has the exact same rhythm and intonation as the one before it, and it's all a little too fast and perky, so it's like being forced to spend 11 hours listening to a salesman's patter. Somewhere between that and Chinese water torture."
281,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3764819-barb,2,"The subtitle of this book is ""Adventures of a Curious Character."" I would definitely say that Richard Feynman is curious--the probably one thing I liked about him was his interest is exploring the world beyond just the physics he specialized in. He worked with biologists when he could've worked with physicists; he tried out deprivation tanks. He pushed himself to learn new languages and paint and get out of his comfort zone. That's admirable.However. The man was insufferable. This book, which is largely a series of stories he told to a friend in a very informal manner, is anecdote after anecdote of him saying, essentially, how much better he was than others. How his was the right way of thinking. He would try to be self-deprecating, but it inevitably wound up as ""But it turned out I was the most awesome!"" Stories tended to go something like, ""Some really smart people were talking about something. I'm such an idiot, and didn't know anything about that topic, but threw out an idea that sprang to mind, because I'm too stupid not to say whatever I'm thinking. And then they lit up! 'What a great idea!' they said. It was really just luck that it happened that way."" Repeat ad infinitum. Some of his stories from his childhood were interesting--and the book is probably best read in brief snippets, so the ego doesn't overwhelm you. But he lost me when relaying the story of putting a waitress's tip under an upside-down full glass of water. And he remained proud of himself for that. The man was not nice. He wasn't a good guy. He didn't feel the need to contribute to the common good. He had zero problems making others' lives miserable, like when he agreed to give a class at a local college, provided he only had to fill out so many forms. Turned out, it required one more form than originally agreed-upon, but instead of just signing it, he made the poor college employee go to what Feynman himself describes as a lot of trouble just to not fill out the form. And he refused to submit receipts for reimbursement (though at least there he accepted that that meant he wouldn't get the money).This isn't even getting into his stories about women.The book wasn't all bad. Like I said, Feynman had some redeeming qualities. He's someone who would be interesting to chat with for a few minutes at a party. But ultimately, as good as he may have been at science and as many interesting stories he may have had, Dick Feynman is not someone I want to spend more time with."
282,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67794375-david,3,"Richard Feynman understood physics. His reader, the cerebral and equally pulchritudinous, david, knows not a thing about physics. Okay, that is not true. “Things fall when you drop them,” I have observed, time and again. Therefore, I have an aptitude for science.I can relate.This guy won a Nobel Prize, hung with Einstein and Oppenheimer, and discovered and documented events that I do not feel like sharing, mostly because I cannot.I, unlike Feynman, garnered a trophy in wrestling. An unusual one. I was one of the few kids on any high school grappling team to have viewed the ceilings of each tournament visited (that is not a good thing in this sport). And it was not by design, but by ambivalence. If at first, you do not succeed, no one really cares. I did not know any scientists, but I did occasion ‘Feinstein & Schloppenheimer’s Deli.’ Ah, the pastrami on rye, you could just die, literally. And still, like every solid American who has learned not to enjoy anything ‘too much,’ I ripened into a vegan decades ago. Go figure. Please pass the Kombucha.A very interesting story, this was. Feynman had his tale to tell and it was atypical. He was one of the architects in the development of the nuclear bomb and was an instructor and/or a student at MIT, Caltech, Cornell, and other top schools. His take on academia for a lifetime, with a IQ that could travel the autobahn but not I-80, makes for some funny moments.He had the corny sense of humor you would expect from a full-time scientist. And much of it made for an enjoyable read, although I go deaf when it comes to jokes that include numbers.So, in conclusion, I would like to thank the members of the Academy, my school teachers who assuaged my youth with ‘C’s rather than ‘F’s and the good people of the Seychelles. Pax vobiscum and give my regards to Broadway."

Very natural, very rich, inspiring and, well, what I enjoyed the most of course, his views of life felt often times aligned with mine, so what's not to love about that? :PThis is a man who knew how to live and how to find beauty in everything he did. His strong curiosity is what makes a difference between a great person who can create whatever he sets his mind on doing, and a random person who simply knows facts about art/science/news but can't use them to create or really understand anything whatsoever.The book is funny and clever. I absolutely loved it and will surely read it again at some point in my life!Here are some quotes that I really connected with:""And, just like it should in all stories about philosophers, it ended up in complete chaos.""""There were a lot of fools at the conference - pompous fools - and pompous fools drive me up the wall. Ordinary fools are all right; you can talk to them, and try to help them out. But pompous fools - guys who are fools and are covering it all over and impressing people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus - that, I cannot stand!""""[...] I was in Italy for a science conference and I thought I'd like to see the Sistine Chapel.

He was very curious. He was curious in almost all the area and he picked at them so quick especially in arts! He was good at arts and music.I also like the part where he talked about ants. He redirect the ants’ route. When I was young, my sister and I did a bit experiment about ants too! I would say he is mischievous at the offices. Messing around with people about safe! I want to hear more about his colleagues point of view too.  He reminds me of Forrest Gump. Both of them were so curious about everything and good at whatever they put foot in it. Here are a few quotes that I like from the book. The last one was from the speech from Caltech commencement in 1974. ‘Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that’s the end of you.’ ‘The first principle is that you must not fool yourself- and you are the easiest person to fool.’ ‘So I have just one wish for you- the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of Inter gritty I have described, and and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.’ The only thing I don’t like about him is his involvement of Manhattan Project. "

I didn't expect to burst out laughing while reading the autobiography of a physicist but that's what ended up happening -- Feynman definitely was a first class prankster! Although physics are often mentioned, you don't need to really know about it to be able to enjoy the book; this is more about his life than his work. It's a joy to read about how much this man enjoys learning, not only physics but also music (bongo player!), painting and so on. Makes you just want to learn those things you've been postponing for a while. I cringed a bit at the way most women are represented in the book, but if that's how the women he met really were, there's nothing really to do about it, you can't rewrite history.I would really advise everybody to read this book. Feynman is a Nobel Prize winner, worked on the atomic bomb and is such an interesting and funny person to read about. Really, what I'm going to remember most from this book is how thoroughly that guy enjoyed life and embraced any challenge he set his mind on."
286,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2646348-natalie,5,"This should be made compulsory in school. At a very basic level as a collection of humorous anecdotes and zany adventures, it already deserves 5 stars, but it is so much more than just a funny book. There is plenty of serious insight and we are so fortunate to have a glimpse into Feynman's ingenious childlike mind. Reading it brings me real comfort to know I'm on the right track - that it's right to remain intellectually curious, that there's fun in learning, that you should always go back to first principles, and that you should never lose any intellectual integrity. So it is baffling and disheartening to see some bad reviews. To anyone who sees this book as self-aggrandizing, you're completely missing the point and I hope you stay a rare breed. But I'm open to hearing you out and I would be grateful if you could share your reasons because I'm just not seeing it at all. My only regret is that I didn't read this sooner, but better late than never. "
287,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5547564-david,5,"Simply put: To date, it is the most thoroughly enjoyable memoir I have ever read! I love Feynman's accounts of his life, of his interminable curiosity, of his brilliance, of his determination to never say ""I can't do this"" and keep at it until he learned, whether it was physics (for which he won the Nobel Prize), learning Portugese, learning to draw, learning to socialize in a bar, learning drums. So inspirational and full of Feynman's very humorous wit throughout. I loved every minute of this!! For audiobook listeners, Raymond Todd absolutely nails the correct tone!"
288,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14875421-anna,5,"It's one of those books after which you think: WHAT? I can only give 5 stars to it?And then you think you should give every other book less stars, because they are not as awesome as this one.And THEN you think about the inspiring character this book is about and that he is such a positive person and never would give other people get less, just because he is so awesome. And then you are just sad that the book is over and thankful that you could read it : ) "
289,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27248823-vishal,5,"How much do you think a person can do in a single lifetime despite having a dedicated attachment to the ever-demanding(and boring, according to laypeople) field of Theoretical Physics?He can learn to make good enough paintings to be shown in an one-man exhibition. He can learn to play Bongo well enough to be included in street competition in pre-carnival seasons in a city of Brazil. He can play drums for a Ballet which would win a national level award. He can learn to crack safes and pick locks which would give him a reputation all over his work arena. He can make reliable observations and conclusions by practicing hallucination, analyzing dreams by falling in and out of sleep, by making an experiment on ants and showing their lack of sense of geometry. He can learn many languages. He can get drunk every now and then in bars and pick up girls. He can stop drinking at once when he wishes to. Despite all of this, he can still win a Nobel Prize.Richard Feynman, the coolest Physicist ever, shows you the vast array of possibilities to consider and explore if you begin with a child-like curiousity about the world and don't let it fade away with passing years of your life. Before reading this book, I was little apprehensive about what I am supposed to do in life if I like so many things and am afraid to pick up one because I don't want losing my other fields of interest. So one of the greatest teachers, Feynman, showed me the way that if you remain curious and manage your time, you can pursue whatever you want.This book of anecdotes might seem a little exaggerating and annoying to some people, who altogether miss the idea of the lessons the author is trying to propagate. One of the reviews on Goodreads says that, the book is full of arrogance and how Feynman is showing off his skills at so many things and taking pride in himself. I pity the poor reviewer who missed the point that how Feynman is not showing that ""I could do it"", he is showing that ""it can be done by you too"". So much rant for the ignorant laypeople.Inspite of the anecdotes about Feynman ""having fun"", the most important parts of this book to be circulated and popularized are his views on pseudo-science and scientific integrity. He experimented with much of pseudo-science including psychics, hallucinations and dream-interpretations and explained the scientific side of those phenomena. He explained how ignorant people are fooled by the practitioners of pseudo-science. About his remarks on scientific integrity, it is a must read for anyone who wishes to pursue science, and it should be read by laypeople too so that they could see how science works and why is it preferable to any cult of faith believe system. He explains the importance of experiments and shows you to be patient with them in the part about his experiments on ants.""You are not obliged to be what others expect you ought to be. If you don't be what they want you to be, it's a failing of their judgement, not your own."" A quote that could be misinterpreted too, but it would be clear when one knows the context in which Feynman said those words. After the death of his first wife and returning from the Nuclear bomb project, he was depressed and had a sense of loss of his zeal for Physics. He was teaching Physics but he didn't think he was making enough contribution to research according to what was expected of him. That's when he explains how he stopped caring and started to play with Science for the love of it. He started with a trivial experiment of analyzing spinning plates and this lead to the ideas in Quantam Physics which later won him the Nobel Prize. The story of recovering is impressive and inspiring, if my elaborations here don't make a convincing case for it then I suggest you to take my word for it and read the part.In conclusion, this is one of the books which you can include in your list of 'Life-changing books'. You can read it again and again, everytime you'll learn something new. Everytime the book will offer a new perspective onto life. Everytime, you'll see how to live a life that is full of Life. "
290,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39595398-fidan-selim-zade,5,"Lifelong curiosity, honesty and bright mind. Incredible passion to science and asking simple question 'why' on all the surrounding things. The relation to the system of education and science in the world of memorising the facts and past discoveries can be summarised in the following quote: ""I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something"""
291,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"It seems only natural to begin my thoughts on this book with a quote from Feynman :The first principle is that you must not fool yourself. And you are the easiest person to fool. These words capture the essence of what formed Feynman's portrait. Someone who questioned all the established notions and believed in science to be ultimately a trial and error method to arrive at the truth. His is a first rate scientific mind that never stops at anything unless he arrives at a conclusion that is satisfying and in accordance with common sense. What makes him different is the fact that he does not stop here but goes one step further to ensure that he does communicate this in the most simplest fashion possible. It is a book long glimpse to the mind of a funny, intelligent and humane persona that made up Richard Feynman.What strikes you most about him is his utter lack of pretension. For a man who won a Nobel, worked on the Manhattan project and has a string of achievements in the field of physics to his credit, he is entirely unassuming. He assumes the same air of fun and gaiety in discussing the Manhattan project as he does on how to flirt with the showgirls in Vegas. This is a no holds barred account of his life and a detailed elucidation on some of his thoughts and perspectives. If I was asked to pick what stood out of this book, I would pick the attribute of curiosity. You do not need a sharp mind to pick out the number of times he tinkers around to find the underlying truths all because it got him curious. The second aspect is that he never shied away from learning all through his life. From what I can recollect right now, he went along and studied how to make music at a Brazilian Carnival, how to gamble like a high roller, how to play bongo drums, how to be interesting to women without emptying your pocket in the process and so on. If you look at these things he learned, they have nothing to do with science but that never stopped him. All that mattered to him was the learning and how to be good at what you learn. It baffled me to see that he could manage to learn so much in one single lifetime. Feynman was never the highbrow kind to spurn all these as beneath him but he embraced all these as the little things that make our World fun to live in. Feynman was above everything else an epitome of irreverence. Social niceties never sat well with him and he was the kind to call a spade its real name, in the loudest way possible no matter what the occasion was . Bureaucracy was what suffered his wrath the most through pranks and vociferous protests. Here is what he had to say about the ruling elite and its policies :  I know it is the way the Government works ; well screw the Government ! I feel that human beings should treat human beings like human beings. And unless I am treated like one, I'm not going to have anything to do with them.  These acts of rebelliousness chose to make him a kind of social pariah, but Feynman being Feynman cared not two hoots about it !This is no biography but an exploration of things that caught his interest from everything ranging from Mayan hieroglyphics and quarks to hallucinations and good looking girls. A very interesting set of anecdotes about a rather unique human being. Recommended. "
292,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"The Most Fascinating ManI just met the most fascinating man in my life – just finished reading “Surely You Must be Joking Mr. Feynman”. Here is a man who is probably one of the brightest that ever walked on this planet. A person who was relentlessly curious, and not just about his own craft, but about almost everything he encountered. An incredibly mischievous person who took nothing very seriously, but at the same time took everything seriously enough to explore passionately. Feynman was obsessed with solving problems, and not just in Physics but anything that he took interest in, and that’s a very large universe from machines to drumming, from school education to picking up women in a bar, from art to Mayan hieroglyphics. Above all, he was a man who was irreverent towards all ideas until it made complete sense to him.What bothered Feynman the most was people’s lack of deep understanding of what they believe they understand. Most of us believe we understand a few things, especially things that relate to our professions, but do we really? Most of us have a very superficial sense of things that we know, which may be adequate to waddle through our jobs and our life, but the kind of deep understanding that Feynman is referring to, where everything fits together and makes perfect sense, where one is capable of explaining to another individual with perfect clarity, is mostly missing. Even more dangerous is that fact that most of us are not even aware how muddled our understandings are. Most of us, as individuals, and sometimes entire professions, suffer from this grand illusion without ever being challenged.I wish I read this book many decades earlier, because there was a possibility that it could have changed my life. I believe it should be a must-read for all young people, especially those that plan to take up a scientific, or for that matter, any intellectual profession. Looking back at my childhood, I had very similar curiosities as Feynman, and like him I spent most of my time tinkering with things and exploring everything from fire to ants and from machines to questions like why we find something musical. However, I was not even nearly as smart, but more importantly, I did not have his perseverance. Many of us are curious when we are young, but intellectual laziness prevents us from exploring them adequately. Most of us also lack the spirit to challenge all ideas that came from authority sources. To Feynman, every idea had to make perfect sense to him, and until then he simply would not accept them. I, on the other hand, grew up with values that tried to convince me that having some “beliefs” is a virtue. These beliefs did not come as religious or social dictates but more as moral and political wisdom, and I convinced my young mind that I am making perfectly rational choices. The funny thing is, if you asked me when I was in my teens or twenties. I would have proclaimed the same mindset that Feynman had, except I really did not practice it. What a remarkable human being – almost unbelievable! I have never met or seen Feynman. Once I stood just outside his office door in CalTech. I have been extremely lucky to have met and spent time with his close friend and colleague Murray Gell-Mann, who is often mentioned in this book. Another astounding mind…"
293,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31318644-ankit-kumar,5,"Well, another autobiographical book which I loved very much. This time it is from a visionary whom I have admired for a long time, without knowing much about his work and life. This book gives a such an honest account of the life of Feynman, that too by himself. You will never read a better book by someone like this. The title of the book does full justice to the material inside the book, right from the first page. Feynman pens down all of his adventures in life which revolves around his passion- ""Physics"". And other stuff that he learned and talked because he was curious about them. He was a person, who will not accept something just by hearing it or just by looking at it from face value, He would go great length to understand the reason behind them, by himself. After much thought and deliberation, he will accept it with full integrity and fight for it, or reject it forthright and will continue to do so without fearing the consequences. There is so much to learn from the character of Feynman. I cannot do justice by writing about that in this review, but you ought to read it and understand it and feel it yourself. Do read this book, you will have so much fun reading about his adventures and also sound reasons behind them. This book has so many complex concepts, phenomena are discussed with such humility and simplicity, and without any pretence that only Feynman could have (or I have read till date about in a person). The last few paragraphs of the book, in which Feynman gives advice about how to maintain integrity in scientific pursuit by anyone, and take full responsibility of what you are doing and why you are doing so, particularly given me so much to think about my own practice and future in science. I would like to finish this review by quoting Feynman, from this book, which I found very inspirational and something which we should think about all the time in our lives. "" You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.""~ Richard P. Feynman(Surely you're joking Mr Feynman)"
294,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3989689-asails-f,5,"I found myself unable to make fair judgement about: Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a Curious Character. One day I gave it three stars and another five. I should think that it certainly deserves five stars in that it is one of the few books that delve into the mind of a genius and gives some idea to their thought process's. My desire to write a review of this book are threefold:I was stationed in Orlando Florida and it was mandatory that we watch the liftoff's.After the Challenger shuttle disaster I worked for a woman who did quality assurance for repairs on US Polaris ballistic missile systems who worked with the same seals that failed on the shuttle disaster. Long before the results were published by the investigation team she met Mr. Feynman on a flight to duty stations. In their exchange he asked her what she thought was the problem and told him without a doubt it was the seals. Reagan the president at the time this disaster had exerted pressure to launch the Challenger in the overly cold weather. I also watched the media's involvement and unneeded sensationalism about the delays that undoubtedly provoked a too hasty decision to launch. I have read many management studies attributing this debacle as a legacy of the decision making process called Groupthink. As this can only be so and knowledge of the affects of cold on the seals was widely know in professional circles and also at NASA it must be surmised that we have a warped decision making system in place in our government.The lightness that Feynman's stories give to the seriousness of his academic career must only be surmised as a way of dealing with his knowledge of how many problems the Earth is facing in part due to our faulty decision making. It was driven home after watching a video about his life where I was almost brought to tears... The must see video is The Quest For Tannu Tuva[1988] which seemed to be more widely shown in the UK than in the US.Let's learn from Feynman."
295,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22392990-eoin-flynn,5,"This book is simply a reprint some of the material from the wonderful ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"".For anyone who's read that book - I wouldn't bother reading this one. There's very little new material in it and it's less detailed.Despite that, it is still a fantastic read. For anyone who hasn't read The Pleasure of Finding Things Out then pick this book up and get reading!As a scientist, I can tell you that Richard Feynman's Horizon episode from 1981 - from the transcripts of which, much of this book is taken - is one the main reasons I became a research scientist. I've watched it a million times. This book is the written form of that. It's a perfect description of what it really is to know something. Of how to accurately determine something - not just in science but in everyday life. It also serves as guide to not succumbing to the many and varied pitfalls of poor thinking. It is a very human account of a man who, even to other great scientists, seemed god-like in his intellect, how that man and that intellect came to be and how oddly achievable it seems (though of course you know it can never be for us mere mortals).From a more shallow perspective, this book is a series of witty anecdotes about a scientific genius of the 20th century that anyone can enjoy. "
296,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12973215-danny-tyran,3,"Feynman is/was (is he still alive?) brilliant, but he knew it too much. I dislike people too proud of themselves.The story line of this book is simple:1. Feynman begins something new (new course, new job, any other activity)2. He finds a way to improve some piece of equipment or some process (working process,...)3. A few people tell him that he is a genius and accept to change things (equipment or process) and most of the others resist the change suggested by Feynman4. Go to 1 and do it all again.There are some funny parts. But I'd lie if I told you that I understood everything that the author explained. Even at the very beginning, Feynman was a little boy who repaired TVs and radios for his family and for neighbors. Who still understand how worked apparels with lamps? I can't even imagine that electric devices could work that way. All I know is that sometimes the lamps burned out and you had to change them, but what if it was not a burned-out bulb that caused the problem? The author explained something that he understood very well by himself when he was around 9 years old. I still don't understand it even with his explanation. :(Anyway, if you like anecdotal stories, probably you'll like this book. I liked it, but I can't tell that I loved it."

298,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10486715-l,5,"One of the most inspirational books I have read lately. Apart from being one hilarious ride with an adventurous theoretical physicist, this book also reminded me of somewhat forgotten ways of learning, thinking and experimenting in life and academics/career. Feynman comes across as an honest, courageous, fun-filled character who had certain child-like innocence and curiosity in his spirit. The writing will make you laugh, wonder and think. Feynman's free-spirited nature, his attitude of questioning status-quo, his insatiable curiosity, his will to step out of his comfort zone and try new and often difficult things is inspiring, to the extent that one would want to break their present monotonous life and set out for their own adventure!This book demands a permanent place in your library and re-reads."
299,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222886-aasem-bakhshi,4,"There ain't any books about stubborn men who are among the most curious creatures in the universe, love to play bongos and paint nude models, jump every now and then into sense-deprivation-hallucination-trigger capsules and master the art of moving their egos out of their bodies so that they can watch themselves from outside, can crack any damn safe in the world, steal people's doors, make an atom bomb, experiment with their own dreaming and ant psychology, study at MIT and Princeton, teach at Caltech, start their careers by giving presentation to people like Wolfgang Pauli and Einstein, and end up winning the Nobel prize.So does it make any difference if such a book is written in a sloppy way? No matter how slapdash, it would end up just a tinge less then amazing, due to its extraordinary subject matter. Richard Feynman, may you rest in peace. "

Richard Feynman was a genius with a super inquiring mind that is a hallmark of all great men, but what makes him so unique is that his life didn't just have one dimension. He was curious about so many fields and activities and the way he describes them in this book are so fantastic that you end up wanting to try those things out! "

302,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1224976-julie,1,"Nope, not wasting any more time on this clown. I read up through his chapter on how to neg a woman in order to trick her into sleeping with you and thought ""Yep, I am done. Gave this the good ol' college try but the bad outweighs the good here."" Who knew Feynman, as well as being a brilliant Nobel Prize winning physicist was also the patron saint of the PUA(Pick up artist) community?I am honestly shocked at the number of rave reviews this collection of personal anecdotes has. I assume people are blinded by Feynman's intellect - which was staggering - and his joyful attitude towards learning for learning's sake. Perhaps if I had read a biography of Feynman, written by someone else, I wouldn't have had such a negative reaction to him?It seemed obvious to me, both as a former SPED teacher and as the parent of someone on the autistic spectrum, that Feynman had undiagnosed Asperger's Syndrome. He often mentions his inability to understand social cues and to interact successfully with others. His story of using other people's nervous laughter as a clue that his behavior was incorrect was telling. He couldn't tell by unspoken body language or facial expressions or tone of voice - he needed actual tittering laughter to signal that he needed to adjust his behavior. Feynman used his prodigious intellect to help him work around his deficits in social behavior but often it wasn't enough.The first painful story was that of the waitress and the tip. Oh wow. Even when telling the story, years later, he has no idea how egregious his behavior was. He pulled the juvenile trick of leaving the tip as coins with a full glass of water on top. Two glasses with the coins split between them. Just what a busy server in a restaurant wants to deal with. To add insult to injury, this was a restaurant he went to daily & a waitress that often served him. This is how he repays her for doing a good job. His motivation for being a jerk? He wanted to see if she would be able to figure out how to get her tip without making a big mess, though how he would know this is unclear, since he wasn't there when she attempted it. He returns the next day to find everyone angry at him & the waitress refusing to interact with him anymore. She didn't have time for his intellectual query - since, you know, she had an actual job she needed to be doing - and the water spilled everywhere & that made extra work for her, cleaning his mess up, and then later she slipped & hurt herself on the still damp floor. Feynman has no clue that he has done anything wrong & can't figure out why people are upset. Then - get this - HE DOES IT AGAIN WITH THE NEW WAITRESS SERVING HIM. Hardy har har, ain't he a hoot?He tells many stories like this, where he is a complete asshole to people. He can't understand why people don't trust him and think he is a liar. One thing he enjoyed doing was pretending to be drunk when he wasn't - ugh, insert big eye roll here - because, I don't know honestly. Because he has no understanding of human emotions and common reactions?I stopped reading after the anecdote about how he is a nice guy but woman still won't have sex with him - can't they see how nice he is, damn it?! - so he meets a guy who teaches him the trick is to treat women like whores and bitches. "" I adopted the attitude that those girls are all bitches, that they aren't worth anything, and that all they're in there for is to get you to buy them a drink, and they're not going to give you a goddamn thing. I'm not going to be a gentleman to such worthless bitches and so on. I learned it till it was automatic.""A good reminder that just because someone is an intellectual genius or has an amazing artistic talent or incredible physical prowess doesn't make them a decent or even likable person. People tend to ascribe positive characteristics to successful people whether they are truly worthy of them or not. Feynman is a good example of this."
303,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,2,"The bits on doing physics are interesting; the bits on picking up aging tigers in shady New York bars, not so much.This book will likely appeal far more to science fanboys and groupies rather than scientists themselves. The goal of the book seems mostly to convince lay people that scientists are indeed human beings who have hobbies, eat at restaurants, and have sexual intercourse (gasp!). Given that most scientists likely see themselves as human beings, I think the majority of the book would be quite boring for them. I personally far prefer Feynman's nonfiction books and video lectures, which are served crystal-clear with a side of motivation.However, now that I've thoroughly demotivated your wanting to read this book, there are two upsides.First, to a baby scientist (a middle-schooler, high-schooler, or college freshman aspiring to become a scientist), especially one who doesn't come from a family of scientists or hasn't met many in their life, this book is a much more inspirational look at the life of an (atypical) scientist than the Wikipedia entry on scientist. That said, if you know a youngling leaning towards a life scientific, this is a great (dangerous?) book to pass along to them.Second, hidden amongst the fluff are stellar pieces of advice for doing science, what I will refer to as ""Feynmanisms."" Most aren't explicit but are simply what I interpreted from Feynman's stories on doing science. Here's a list of my favorites:Seek people and ideas outside your own field. There's a great pressure in science to confine yourself to one field. This pressure comes from funding agencies and administrators who must be able to easily define which discipline your work is in, as well as from interactions with other scientists in your field, who will of course mostly suggest ideas and insights from within that field. Resist this pressure. Speak with scientists in either fields about their ideas and your own. Seek connections. It will often be hard to communicate but its always worth the effort.Don't be afraid to ask questions. Many a student or scientist finds himself at the end of a long lecture, completely lost because he didn't have the courage to ask what a word on the second slide meant. Get over it. You are and will always be a student and there will always be things you don't know.Think in examples. It's easy to get lost if you think about every new concept you learn in terms of another new concept you only learned ten minutes ago. Yet this is often the way books try to teach. Instead, when trying to follow an explanation, think in a concrete example and add features slowly. It might be ""faster"" to use jargon and buzzwords to explain a concept, but there's no use in this compression if you don't understand what's going on.Don't fool yourself into thinking you know something you don't. It is surprisingly easy to convince the human brain that it understands something that it most certainly does not. Knowing the name of something is not the same as understanding what it is. Throwing around buzzwords is an easy way to fake understanding to others, but it's impossible to be creative or have any fun if all you can do is mix and match buzzwords.Never stop playing. Remember why you enjoyed physics (or whichever field) in the first place; it's fun to play with ideas! No administrator or scientific colleague is ever going to ask you to spend more time playing, but that is often crucial to coming up with new ideas as well as having fun."
304,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,5,I really enjoyed this book and learning about this man. Just the kind of guy one would love to have as a friend. Such curiosity. Such lack of pretension! Marvelously enjoyable book. 
305,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"A while back, I read another book by Feynman, The Pleasure of Finding Things Out, and I wasn't all that thrilled with it. It was kind of disappointing at the time. I knew that Feynman's fame came not only from his scientific brilliance, but from the fact that he was a genuinely interesting, funny and mischievous person. I had hoped that I could find some of that in the book, but to no avail. And so I gave it away so that someone else could get the pleasure from it that I could not.Still, I was not completely turned off Feynman. There are videos of him around the internet that really show his vibrancy, his energy and the passion with which he approached the world, and I knew there would come a time when I would have to give him a second chance. Thus, this book.Surely You're Joking, Mister Feynman! is the story - or rather a collection of stories - about what can happen to a person with immense confidence in his own abilities, an insatiable curiosity about the world, a willingness to make mistakes, all topped off with a generous helping of genius.First, as Feynman calls them at the beginning of the book, some vitals. Richard Feynman was a theoretical physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project, taught at Caltech, and won the Nobel Prize in physics for his contributions to quantum electrodynamics. He was also one hell of a bongo player, an accomplished artist, and a self-taught safecracker. He was a joker and a prankster and a ladies' man who could bluff his way into pretty much anything he wanted to do, and was often surprised that people believed his bravado. He had a passion for mysteries and puzzles and figuring out how things worked, from combination locks to the movements of electrons to why water curves the way it does when it comes out the tap, and he didn't give a good goddamn about what the rest of the world thought of him.In other words, Richard Feynman was a pretty awesome guy.This book is a collection of Feynman's stories, the kind that he might tell at a party or with a bunch of friends traveling. They're the variety of story that might begin with, ""Did I ever tell you how I joined a samba band in Rio?"" and just go on from there. He starts with his youth, how he was the kind of boy who just loved to tinker with things. He would take electronics apart and put them back together, and then go to junk shops to buy parts that he could build into better radios. He did experiments with ants to find out how they communicated, and dedicated himself so hard to solving puzzles that eventually all he needed was the first line, and he could immediately come back with, ""He starts by chopping every other one in three parts.""He was one of those kids whose curiosity was boundless, and who never even imagined that there was anything ""better"" he could have been doing than exploring how the world worked. I couldn't shake the feeling that if young Feynman were around today, he'd be medicated to the eyeballs just to stop him being so ""weird."" But you know me. Cynic.We follow him through his days at MIT, pulling pranks with friends and discovering those interesting weaknesses in human thought processes that allowed him to get away with murder when he was young. His habits of wondering how things work carried him through his participation in the Manhattan Project, his travels to countries like Brazil and Japan, and led him through a life that was never without fascinating and entertaining discoveries.Long story short (too late), Feynman is - or at least should be - a model for young people today. While the book isn't pitched towards young people, there are several lessons in it that should be taught to every child.The first is that the world is infinitely interesting. Any kid who whines that she is bored needs to be shown the million and one ways that you can combat boredom just within a ten-foot radius of where you're sitting. Look at something - anything and ask yourself, ""I wonder how that works,"" and then go find out. The possibilities are endless, and the potential exists that you may discover a passion you never knew you had. Feynman didn't start out wondering how electrons work - he fixed his neighbors' radios just because he could. One thing led to another, and next thing you know - BAM! Nobel Prize.The second point, and it is connected to the first, is to never say No. In his essay, ""But Is It Art?"" he talks about how he learned to draw. It started when an artist friend offered to teach Feynman how to draw if he would teach the artist about science. While Feynman believed that he would be an absolutely atrocious artist, he still agreed to the challenge, and he stuck with it. Eventually he became well-known as a decent artist, even managing to sell some of his works. Now obviously, there are limits and caveats to ""never"" - there are times when saying No is the right thing to do. But when you find an opportunity to expand your abilities, to learn new things and face new challenges, the automatic ""No"" may deprive you of a joy that you never knew you could experience.Third, you must know who you are. One of the problems inherent in living in a society is that there's always someone trying to tell you who you are, or at least who you should be. Your parents, teachers, friends, all have an image of you in their heads, and are all trying to mold you into that image, consciously or unconsciously. Add to that the government, media, corporations, advertisements, shysters, preachers and other deliverers of hokum and propaganda who are also trying to tell you who you really are, despite having never met you and being pretty sure that you don't already know yourself. And many people, sadly, don't. But Feynman did. He knew who he was, and that was all he needed. He occasionally let people think differently about him, but the thread that runs through this book is a rock-solid self-awareness that allowed him the self-confidence to pick up showgirls or try to turn down a Nobel Prize.The caveat to this, and a corollary to the second point, is that you can always discover new things about who you are. All through the book, we see Feynman faced with a new opportunity that he thinks he can't do because it's just Not Him. Drawing, playing music, learning languages - those skills didn't fit into the mental model of who he thought he was, a flaw that all of us possess. A lot of us, without even giving it a try, might immediately discard something by saying, ""Well, that's just not me."" Maybe it could be. It takes courage, and the willingness to fall flat on your face, but if you can discover a new talent or a new passion, isn't it worth it?Finally, remember that everyone else around you is just as human as you are. Don't be impressed by titles and uniforms, fancy suits and impressive business cards. Don't assume that just because someone wears a soldier's uniform or a thousand dollar suit that they are somehow ""better"" than you. Feynman not only resisted authority in so many of these tales, he actively worked to subvert it. Whether it's trying to sneak codes past military censors or breaking into the safe that held all the secrets of the atomic bomb, he never let a title get in the way of learning or growing.One of my favorite Feynman stories related to this last point isn't actually in this book, but I'll mention it anyway. After the Challenger disaster back in 1986, NASA was called on the carpet to explain to Congress why their shiny new space shuttle went Kaboom. The NASA managers went on and on about the O-rings, filling their talk with supercilious jargon and doublespeak, hoping that their haughty attitudes and impenetrable explanations of why the cold weather made the O-rings fail would be comprehensible enough to satisfy the committee, yet obtuse enough to avoid actually admitting that they had done anything wrong. While they were doing this, Feynman put a piece of the O-ring material into a glass of ice water and let it sit there for a while. Then he took it out, stretched it, and showed that it had lost the pliability that it needed to do its job. With a simple demonstration, he not only showed the fault that led to the Challenger explosion, but at the same time put a bunch of self-aggrandizing stuffed shirts in their places.I love that story.Anyway, if you're looking for a Feynman book to read - and who isn't? - this is the one to start with. There's not much hard talk about science in it, just lots of stories about a really interesting guy. Even if it doesn't make you want to get into quantum electrodynamic theory, I hope it still makes you look at the world in a different way."
306,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93868753-rubel-rana,5,"One of the most beautiful minds in the history of human race was talking to me like a 12 years old boy with full of ebullience. Although I imagined him as a demure individual, and thought It would be a sluggish writing, But it turned out to be dulcet. I didn't even expect that His life round efflorescence beautiful brain and who himself was a harbinger who had knowledge of past also could be this hilarious and this down to earth. I laughed and got astonished that how easily and in a lilt way he handled in the real time and later discussed it in this book of all those imbroglios.Anyway I never write reviews of books, I just simply share my feelings. This was no way more than that. I wish time travel was possible so that I could meet Einstein, Feynman, Carl Sagan, Marie Curie And the love of my life Audrey Hepburn. I love Feynman that much, So I would've given 100 stars to it let alone 5 ❤️"
307,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5014554-jack,5,"I found myself unable to make fair judgement about: Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a Curious Character. One day I gave it three stars and another five. I should think that it certainly deserves five stars in that it is one of the few books that delve into the mind of a genius and gives some idea to their thought process's. My desire to write a review of this book are threefold:I was stationed in Orlando Florida and it was mandatory that we watch the liftoff's.After the Challenger shuttle disaster I worked for a woman who did quality assurance for repairs on US Polaris ballistic missile systems who worked with the same seals that failed on the shuttle disaster. Long before the results were published by the investigation team she met Mr. Feynman on a flight to duty stations. In their exchange he asked her what she thought was the problem and told him without a doubt it was the seals. Reagan the president at the time this disaster had exerted pressure to launch the Challenger in the overly cold weather. I also watched the media's involvement and unneeded sensationalism about the delays that undoubtedly provoked a too hasty decision to launch. I have read many management studies attributing this debacle as a legacy of the decision making process called Groupthink. As this can only be so and knowledge of the affects of cold on the seals was widely know in professional circles and also at NASA it must be surmised that we have a warped decision making system in place in our government.The lightness that Feynman's stories give to the seriousness of his academic career must only be surmised as a way of dealing with his knowledge of how many problems the Earth is facing in part due to our faulty decision making. It was driven home after watching a video about his life where I was almost brought to tears... The must see video is The Quest For Tannu Tuva[1988] which seemed to be more widely shown in the UK than in the US.Let's learn from Feynman."
308,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68153-maura,2,"this turned into a book i was racing thru just so it would be over. it's not that it's bad. it's essentially a compendium of all the stories Feynman could tell during a dinner party. and the stories are well told, and there's many amusing bits in them. but, you see, i didn't end up liking him. and in real life, i would have probably been amused by him at the first party, only spent a short time with him at the 2nd party, and then spent any further parties making sure i was in another part of the room. his ego, it's just too big. and he spends way too much time talking down his accomplishments only to build himself up even higher than when he started, often at the expense of someone else.all that said, i suspect he would have been a good professor to have [he's good with the concrete examples of the few physics problems he mentions in this book], and if i run across some of his collected physics lectures, i would probably read them and learn a lot."
309,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2758455-katy,4,"A nice collection of stories from the life of Dr. Feynman. Not only was he a Nobel Prize winning physicist, but also truly a man who loved learning and was curious of most things."
310,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,1,"I totally agree with Emily, the top reviewer with 113 comments, most of them chastising her for not loving this book, and many of them trying to imply she's simply not smart enough to appreciate Feynman if she doesn't love it. Without attempting to demean or diminish Feynman's actual brilliance and greatness as a scientist, I declare: this book is annoying as shit. Without dismissing the many very real talents Mr. Feynman had, I'm not convinced that compelling and empathetic writing was one of them. I'm aware this book is little more than a compilation of interviews with Feynman, so perhaps the blame there lies with his co-author/editor, who took Feynman too much at his literal word and failed to effectively work the many anecdotes into a pleasing and well-written whole. I'm told Feynman was a very likeable guy, but the guy who comes across in these anecdotes seems to me to be only likeable in small doses. He seems bombastic, overbearing, even a bit grandiose in his manner, despite paying lip service to modesty – and by this, I don't just mean he spends too much time bragging about how clever he is, which he also does. Don't bother dinging me for saying this by pointing out that he IS pretty goddamn clever and has earned some bragging rights - I'm aware of that, and I don't care. He could be the smartest person in the history of the world, but braggadocio is still not an attractive habit. And don't try to tell me it's an essential quality of an autobiography, either. I've read other autobiographies where people spend upward of 300 pages talking about themselves without making me want to punt them.No, I sense something deeper in Feynman's manner of speaking that says to me, This person is utterly arrogant and yes, self-aggrandizing. (Emily's word.) It strikes me as the sound of someone who's spent too much of his life with his fanboys hanging on his every word, so that now he thinks every word that comes out of his mouth is actually worth hanging on. This may be a justifiable mistake for someone in Feynman's position, but that doesn't make it any less a mistake. In fact, I think it's a mistake that is at the heart of this book – the concept of, “It's Feynman, so of COURSE we can just compile a bunch of interviews with him about random shit he did one time, put them in chronological order, and it'll be great!”And I don't find Feynman nearly as funny, endearing, or even interesting as he thinks he is. To be fair, I admit he seems from afar like a terribly interesting man, but I quickly discovered I do NOT want to spend 11 solid hours listening to him tell seemingly random and generally trivial stories about episodes in his life. One or two anecdotes may be mildly entertaining, but his style gets old in a hurry, and his sense of humor seems downright mean-spirited at times. Perhaps my mistake was in attempting to vread it straight through – I don't really have any other way to vread. But you can only vread so many anecdotes about experimenting with ants and their pheromone trails or working on broken radios as a kid before you realize each one may be slightly interesting, but when you put them all together in a row, their total interest value doesn't accumulate. Meanwhile, Feynman's annoyance value DOES. Therefore, I recommend this book (a) in small doses, say for example as light bedtime reading, or (b) for those on the “Feynman can do no wrong” bandwagon. This latter group is his true audience – the ones who are delighted to hang on every word that comes out of his mouth. And I suspect that in the latter half of his life, he moved through a world so surrounded by those people that he forgot there was anything else. I could be wrong – maybe it's not Feynman's fault at all, and this isn't really him. This could be just the aspect of him that's been asked to sit down in front of a microphone and tell every story about himself that he can think of. When your friends tell you that your war stories are so awesome they should be compiled and published as a book, is there any other way it can really come out?Audio notes: The audio version is not helped by a narrator who seems to be sort of channeling Feynman's manner of speaking – his rhythms and intonations, though not his accent or timbre – and it makes a slightly annoying series of anecdotes that much MORE annoying and somewhat duller than the material itself would warrant. I pulled up recordings of Feynman's lectures and more casual interviews, and there's enough of a match to his casual speech patterns that I think it's intentional. But it's as though the narrator learned to imitate Feynman by listening to him speak a single sentence, and then he just repeats that sentence over and over. Every sentence has the exact same rhythm and intonation as the one before it, and it's all a little too fast and perky, so it's like being forced to spend 11 hours listening to a salesman's patter. Somewhere between that and Chinese water torture."
311,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3764819-barb,2,"The subtitle of this book is ""Adventures of a Curious Character."" I would definitely say that Richard Feynman is curious--the probably one thing I liked about him was his interest is exploring the world beyond just the physics he specialized in. He worked with biologists when he could've worked with physicists; he tried out deprivation tanks. He pushed himself to learn new languages and paint and get out of his comfort zone. That's admirable.However. The man was insufferable. This book, which is largely a series of stories he told to a friend in a very informal manner, is anecdote after anecdote of him saying, essentially, how much better he was than others. How his was the right way of thinking. He would try to be self-deprecating, but it inevitably wound up as ""But it turned out I was the most awesome!"" Stories tended to go something like, ""Some really smart people were talking about something. I'm such an idiot, and didn't know anything about that topic, but threw out an idea that sprang to mind, because I'm too stupid not to say whatever I'm thinking. And then they lit up! 'What a great idea!' they said. It was really just luck that it happened that way."" Repeat ad infinitum. Some of his stories from his childhood were interesting--and the book is probably best read in brief snippets, so the ego doesn't overwhelm you. But he lost me when relaying the story of putting a waitress's tip under an upside-down full glass of water. And he remained proud of himself for that. The man was not nice. He wasn't a good guy. He didn't feel the need to contribute to the common good. He had zero problems making others' lives miserable, like when he agreed to give a class at a local college, provided he only had to fill out so many forms. Turned out, it required one more form than originally agreed-upon, but instead of just signing it, he made the poor college employee go to what Feynman himself describes as a lot of trouble just to not fill out the form. And he refused to submit receipts for reimbursement (though at least there he accepted that that meant he wouldn't get the money).This isn't even getting into his stories about women.The book wasn't all bad. Like I said, Feynman had some redeeming qualities. He's someone who would be interesting to chat with for a few minutes at a party. But ultimately, as good as he may have been at science and as many interesting stories he may have had, Dick Feynman is not someone I want to spend more time with."
312,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67794375-david,3,"Richard Feynman understood physics. His reader, the cerebral and equally pulchritudinous, david, knows not a thing about physics. Okay, that is not true. “Things fall when you drop them,” I have observed, time and again. Therefore, I have an aptitude for science.I can relate.This guy won a Nobel Prize, hung with Einstein and Oppenheimer, and discovered and documented events that I do not feel like sharing, mostly because I cannot.I, unlike Feynman, garnered a trophy in wrestling. An unusual one. I was one of the few kids on any high school grappling team to have viewed the ceilings of each tournament visited (that is not a good thing in this sport). And it was not by design, but by ambivalence. If at first, you do not succeed, no one really cares. I did not know any scientists, but I did occasion ‘Feinstein & Schloppenheimer’s Deli.’ Ah, the pastrami on rye, you could just die, literally. And still, like every solid American who has learned not to enjoy anything ‘too much,’ I ripened into a vegan decades ago. Go figure. Please pass the Kombucha.A very interesting story, this was. Feynman had his tale to tell and it was atypical. He was one of the architects in the development of the nuclear bomb and was an instructor and/or a student at MIT, Caltech, Cornell, and other top schools. His take on academia for a lifetime, with a IQ that could travel the autobahn but not I-80, makes for some funny moments.He had the corny sense of humor you would expect from a full-time scientist. And much of it made for an enjoyable read, although I go deaf when it comes to jokes that include numbers.So, in conclusion, I would like to thank the members of the Academy, my school teachers who assuaged my youth with ‘C’s rather than ‘F’s and the good people of the Seychelles. Pax vobiscum and give my regards to Broadway."
313,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,5,"I had soooo much fun reading this book! It's as if you're sitting in a room with Feynman and you're just randomly telling stories. Very natural, very rich, inspiring and, well, what I enjoyed the most of course, his views of life felt often times aligned with mine, so what's not to love about that? :PThis is a man who knew how to live and how to find beauty in everything he did. His strong curiosity is what makes a difference between a great person who can create whatever he sets his mind on doing, and a random person who simply knows facts about art/science/news but can't use them to create or really understand anything whatsoever.The book is funny and clever. I absolutely loved it and will surely read it again at some point in my life!Here are some quotes that I really connected with:""And, just like it should in all stories about philosophers, it ended up in complete chaos.""""There were a lot of fools at the conference - pompous fools - and pompous fools drive me up the wall. Ordinary fools are all right; you can talk to them, and try to help them out. But pompous fools - guys who are fools and are covering it all over and impressing people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus - that, I cannot stand!""""[...] I was in Italy for a science conference and I thought I'd like to see the Sistine Chapel. I got there very early in the morning, bought my ticket before anybody else, and ran up the stairs as soon as the place opened. I therefore had the unusual pleasure of looking at the whole chapel for a moment, in silent awe, before anybody else came in."""
314,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42787747-thinn,4,"I really like how human he is in this book. There was no heroic moment he mentioned about himself and he even admitted his mistakes! He was very curious. He was curious in almost all the area and he picked at them so quick especially in arts! He was good at arts and music.I also like the part where he talked about ants. He redirect the ants’ route. When I was young, my sister and I did a bit experiment about ants too! I would say he is mischievous at the offices. Messing around with people about safe! I want to hear more about his colleagues point of view too.  He reminds me of Forrest Gump. Both of them were so curious about everything and good at whatever they put foot in it. Here are a few quotes that I like from the book. The last one was from the speech from Caltech commencement in 1974. ‘Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that’s the end of you.’ ‘The first principle is that you must not fool yourself- and you are the easiest person to fool.’ ‘So I have just one wish for you- the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of Inter gritty I have described, and and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.’ The only thing I don’t like about him is his involvement of Manhattan Project. "
315,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/436784-leippya,5,"A fascinating read, and also surprisingly hilarious! I didn't expect to burst out laughing while reading the autobiography of a physicist but that's what ended up happening -- Feynman definitely was a first class prankster! Although physics are often mentioned, you don't need to really know about it to be able to enjoy the book; this is more about his life than his work. It's a joy to read about how much this man enjoys learning, not only physics but also music (bongo player!), painting and so on. Makes you just want to learn those things you've been postponing for a while. I cringed a bit at the way most women are represented in the book, but if that's how the women he met really were, there's nothing really to do about it, you can't rewrite history.I would really advise everybody to read this book. Feynman is a Nobel Prize winner, worked on the atomic bomb and is such an interesting and funny person to read about. Really, what I'm going to remember most from this book is how thoroughly that guy enjoyed life and embraced any challenge he set his mind on."
316,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2646348-natalie,5,"This should be made compulsory in school. At a very basic level as a collection of humorous anecdotes and zany adventures, it already deserves 5 stars, but it is so much more than just a funny book. There is plenty of serious insight and we are so fortunate to have a glimpse into Feynman's ingenious childlike mind. Reading it brings me real comfort to know I'm on the right track - that it's right to remain intellectually curious, that there's fun in learning, that you should always go back to first principles, and that you should never lose any intellectual integrity. So it is baffling and disheartening to see some bad reviews. To anyone who sees this book as self-aggrandizing, you're completely missing the point and I hope you stay a rare breed. But I'm open to hearing you out and I would be grateful if you could share your reasons because I'm just not seeing it at all. My only regret is that I didn't read this sooner, but better late than never. "
317,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5547564-david,5,"Simply put: To date, it is the most thoroughly enjoyable memoir I have ever read! I love Feynman's accounts of his life, of his interminable curiosity, of his brilliance, of his determination to never say ""I can't do this"" and keep at it until he learned, whether it was physics (for which he won the Nobel Prize), learning Portugese, learning to draw, learning to socialize in a bar, learning drums. So inspirational and full of Feynman's very humorous wit throughout. I loved every minute of this!! For audiobook listeners, Raymond Todd absolutely nails the correct tone!"

I can only give 5 stars to it?And then you think you should give every other book less stars, because they are not as awesome as this one.And THEN you think about the inspiring character this book is about and that he is such a positive person and never would give other people get less, just because he is so awesome. And then you are just sad that the book is over and thankful that you could read it : ) "

He can learn to play Bongo well enough to be included in street competition in pre-carnival seasons in a city of Brazil. He can play drums for a Ballet which would win a national level award. He can learn to crack safes and pick locks which would give him a reputation all over his work arena. He can make reliable observations and conclusions by practicing hallucination, analyzing dreams by falling in and out of sleep, by making an experiment on ants and showing their lack of sense of geometry. He can learn many languages. He can get drunk every now and then in bars and pick up girls. He can stop drinking at once when he wishes to. Despite all of this, he can still win a Nobel Prize.Richard Feynman, the coolest Physicist ever, shows you the vast array of possibilities to consider and explore if you begin with a child-like curiousity about the world and don't let it fade away with passing years of your life. Before reading this book, I was little apprehensive about what I am supposed to do in life if I like so many things and am afraid to pick up one because I don't want losing my other fields of interest. So one of the greatest teachers, Feynman, showed me the way that if you remain curious and manage your time, you can pursue whatever you want.This book of anecdotes might seem a little exaggerating and annoying to some people, who altogether miss the idea of the lessons the author is trying to propagate. One of the reviews on Goodreads says that, the book is full of arrogance and how Feynman is showing off his skills at so many things and taking pride in himself. I pity the poor reviewer who missed the point that how Feynman is not showing that ""I could do it"", he is showing that ""it can be done by you too"". So much rant for the ignorant laypeople.Inspite of the anecdotes about Feynman ""having fun"", the most important parts of this book to be circulated and popularized are his views on pseudo-science and scientific integrity. He experimented with much of pseudo-science including psychics, hallucinations and dream-interpretations and explained the scientific side of those phenomena. He explained how ignorant people are fooled by the practitioners of pseudo-science. About his remarks on scientific integrity, it is a must read for anyone who wishes to pursue science, and it should be read by laypeople too so that they could see how science works and why is it preferable to any cult of faith believe system. He explains the importance of experiments and shows you to be patient with them in the part about his experiments on ants.""You are not obliged to be what others expect you ought to be. If you don't be what they want you to be, it's a failing of their judgement, not your own."" A quote that could be misinterpreted too, but it would be clear when one knows the context in which Feynman said those words. After the death of his first wife and returning from the Nuclear bomb project, he was depressed and had a sense of loss of his zeal for Physics. He was teaching Physics but he didn't think he was making enough contribution to research according to what was expected of him. That's when he explains how he stopped caring and started to play with Science for the love of it. He started with a trivial experiment of analyzing spinning plates and this lead to the ideas in Quantam Physics which later won him the Nobel Prize. The story of recovering is impressive and inspiring, if my elaborations here don't make a convincing case for it then I suggest you to take my word for it and read the part.In conclusion, this is one of the books which you can include in your list of 'Life-changing books'. You can read it again and again, everytime you'll learn something new. Everytime the book will offer a new perspective onto life. Everytime, you'll see how to live a life that is full of Life. "

Incredible passion to science and asking simple question 'why' on all the surrounding things. The relation to the system of education and science in the world of memorising the facts and past discoveries can be summarised in the following quote: ""I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something"""
321,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"It seems only natural to begin my thoughts on this book with a quote from Feynman :The first principle is that you must not fool yourself. And you are the easiest person to fool. These words capture the essence of what formed Feynman's portrait. Someone who questioned all the established notions and believed in science to be ultimately a trial and error method to arrive at the truth. His is a first rate scientific mind that never stops at anything unless he arrives at a conclusion that is satisfying and in accordance with common sense. What makes him different is the fact that he does not stop here but goes one step further to ensure that he does communicate this in the most simplest fashion possible. It is a book long glimpse to the mind of a funny, intelligent and humane persona that made up Richard Feynman.What strikes you most about him is his utter lack of pretension. For a man who won a Nobel, worked on the Manhattan project and has a string of achievements in the field of physics to his credit, he is entirely unassuming. He assumes the same air of fun and gaiety in discussing the Manhattan project as he does on how to flirt with the showgirls in Vegas. This is a no holds barred account of his life and a detailed elucidation on some of his thoughts and perspectives. If I was asked to pick what stood out of this book, I would pick the attribute of curiosity. You do not need a sharp mind to pick out the number of times he tinkers around to find the underlying truths all because it got him curious. The second aspect is that he never shied away from learning all through his life. From what I can recollect right now, he went along and studied how to make music at a Brazilian Carnival, how to gamble like a high roller, how to play bongo drums, how to be interesting to women without emptying your pocket in the process and so on. If you look at these things he learned, they have nothing to do with science but that never stopped him. All that mattered to him was the learning and how to be good at what you learn. It baffled me to see that he could manage to learn so much in one single lifetime. Feynman was never the highbrow kind to spurn all these as beneath him but he embraced all these as the little things that make our World fun to live in. Feynman was above everything else an epitome of irreverence. Social niceties never sat well with him and he was the kind to call a spade its real name, in the loudest way possible no matter what the occasion was . Bureaucracy was what suffered his wrath the most through pranks and vociferous protests. Here is what he had to say about the ruling elite and its policies :  I know it is the way the Government works ; well screw the Government ! I feel that human beings should treat human beings like human beings. And unless I am treated like one, I'm not going to have anything to do with them.  These acts of rebelliousness chose to make him a kind of social pariah, but Feynman being Feynman cared not two hoots about it !This is no biography but an exploration of things that caught his interest from everything ranging from Mayan hieroglyphics and quarks to hallucinations and good looking girls. A very interesting set of anecdotes about a rather unique human being. Recommended. "
322,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"The Most Fascinating ManI just met the most fascinating man in my life – just finished reading “Surely You Must be Joking Mr. Feynman”. Here is a man who is probably one of the brightest that ever walked on this planet. A person who was relentlessly curious, and not just about his own craft, but about almost everything he encountered. An incredibly mischievous person who took nothing very seriously, but at the same time took everything seriously enough to explore passionately. Feynman was obsessed with solving problems, and not just in Physics but anything that he took interest in, and that’s a very large universe from machines to drumming, from school education to picking up women in a bar, from art to Mayan hieroglyphics. Above all, he was a man who was irreverent towards all ideas until it made complete sense to him.What bothered Feynman the most was people’s lack of deep understanding of what they believe they understand. Most of us believe we understand a few things, especially things that relate to our professions, but do we really? Most of us have a very superficial sense of things that we know, which may be adequate to waddle through our jobs and our life, but the kind of deep understanding that Feynman is referring to, where everything fits together and makes perfect sense, where one is capable of explaining to another individual with perfect clarity, is mostly missing. Even more dangerous is that fact that most of us are not even aware how muddled our understandings are. Most of us, as individuals, and sometimes entire professions, suffer from this grand illusion without ever being challenged.I wish I read this book many decades earlier, because there was a possibility that it could have changed my life. I believe it should be a must-read for all young people, especially those that plan to take up a scientific, or for that matter, any intellectual profession. Looking back at my childhood, I had very similar curiosities as Feynman, and like him I spent most of my time tinkering with things and exploring everything from fire to ants and from machines to questions like why we find something musical. However, I was not even nearly as smart, but more importantly, I did not have his perseverance. Many of us are curious when we are young, but intellectual laziness prevents us from exploring them adequately. Most of us also lack the spirit to challenge all ideas that came from authority sources. To Feynman, every idea had to make perfect sense to him, and until then he simply would not accept them. I, on the other hand, grew up with values that tried to convince me that having some “beliefs” is a virtue. These beliefs did not come as religious or social dictates but more as moral and political wisdom, and I convinced my young mind that I am making perfectly rational choices. The funny thing is, if you asked me when I was in my teens or twenties. I would have proclaimed the same mindset that Feynman had, except I really did not practice it. What a remarkable human being – almost unbelievable! I have never met or seen Feynman. Once I stood just outside his office door in CalTech. I have been extremely lucky to have met and spent time with his close friend and colleague Murray Gell-Mann, who is often mentioned in this book. Another astounding mind…"
323,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31318644-ankit-kumar,5,"Well, another autobiographical book which I loved very much. This time it is from a visionary whom I have admired for a long time, without knowing much about his work and life. This book gives a such an honest account of the life of Feynman, that too by himself. You will never read a better book by someone like this. The title of the book does full justice to the material inside the book, right from the first page. Feynman pens down all of his adventures in life which revolves around his passion- ""Physics"". And other stuff that he learned and talked because he was curious about them. He was a person, who will not accept something just by hearing it or just by looking at it from face value, He would go great length to understand the reason behind them, by himself. After much thought and deliberation, he will accept it with full integrity and fight for it, or reject it forthright and will continue to do so without fearing the consequences. There is so much to learn from the character of Feynman. I cannot do justice by writing about that in this review, but you ought to read it and understand it and feel it yourself. Do read this book, you will have so much fun reading about his adventures and also sound reasons behind them. This book has so many complex concepts, phenomena are discussed with such humility and simplicity, and without any pretence that only Feynman could have (or I have read till date about in a person). The last few paragraphs of the book, in which Feynman gives advice about how to maintain integrity in scientific pursuit by anyone, and take full responsibility of what you are doing and why you are doing so, particularly given me so much to think about my own practice and future in science. I would like to finish this review by quoting Feynman, from this book, which I found very inspirational and something which we should think about all the time in our lives. "" You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.""~ Richard P. Feynman(Surely you're joking Mr Feynman)"

One day I gave it three stars and another five. I should think that it certainly deserves five stars in that it is one of the few books that delve into the mind of a genius and gives some idea to their thought process's. My desire to write a review of this book are threefold:I was stationed in Orlando Florida and it was mandatory that we watch the liftoff's.After the Challenger shuttle disaster I worked for a woman who did quality assurance for repairs on US Polaris ballistic missile systems who worked with the same seals that failed on the shuttle disaster. Long before the results were published by the investigation team she met Mr. Feynman on a flight to duty stations. In their exchange he asked her what she thought was the problem and told him without a doubt it was the seals. Reagan the president at the time this disaster had exerted pressure to launch the Challenger in the overly cold weather. I also watched the media's involvement and unneeded sensationalism about the delays that undoubtedly provoked a too hasty decision to launch. I have read many management studies attributing this debacle as a legacy of the decision making process called Groupthink. As this can only be so and knowledge of the affects of cold on the seals was widely know in professional circles and also at NASA it must be surmised that we have a warped decision making system in place in our government.The lightness that Feynman's stories give to the seriousness of his academic career must only be surmised as a way of dealing with his knowledge of how many problems the Earth is facing in part due to our faulty decision making. It was driven home after watching a video about his life where I was almost brought to tears... The must see video is The Quest For Tannu Tuva[1988] which seemed to be more widely shown in the UK than in the US.Let's learn from Feynman."
325,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22392990-eoin-flynn,5,"This book is simply a reprint some of the material from the wonderful ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"".For anyone who's read that book - I wouldn't bother reading this one. There's very little new material in it and it's less detailed.Despite that, it is still a fantastic read. For anyone who hasn't read The Pleasure of Finding Things Out then pick this book up and get reading!As a scientist, I can tell you that Richard Feynman's Horizon episode from 1981 - from the transcripts of which, much of this book is taken - is one the main reasons I became a research scientist. I've watched it a million times. This book is the written form of that. It's a perfect description of what it really is to know something. Of how to accurately determine something - not just in science but in everyday life. It also serves as guide to not succumbing to the many and varied pitfalls of poor thinking. It is a very human account of a man who, even to other great scientists, seemed god-like in his intellect, how that man and that intellect came to be and how oddly achievable it seems (though of course you know it can never be for us mere mortals).From a more shallow perspective, this book is a series of witty anecdotes about a scientific genius of the 20th century that anyone can enjoy. "
326,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12973215-danny-tyran,3,"Feynman is/was (is he still alive?) brilliant, but he knew it too much. I dislike people too proud of themselves.The story line of this book is simple:1. Feynman begins something new (new course, new job, any other activity)2. He finds a way to improve some piece of equipment or some process (working process,...)3. A few people tell him that he is a genius and accept to change things (equipment or process) and most of the others resist the change suggested by Feynman4. Go to 1 and do it all again.There are some funny parts. But I'd lie if I told you that I understood everything that the author explained. Even at the very beginning, Feynman was a little boy who repaired TVs and radios for his family and for neighbors. Who still understand how worked apparels with lamps? I can't even imagine that electric devices could work that way. All I know is that sometimes the lamps burned out and you had to change them, but what if it was not a burned-out bulb that caused the problem? The author explained something that he understood very well by himself when he was around 9 years old. I still don't understand it even with his explanation. :(Anyway, if you like anecdotal stories, probably you'll like this book. I liked it, but I can't tell that I loved it."
327,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724462-janice,1,"i didn't really read this, but goodreads won't let you choose ""read some of this and decided to throw it against a wall but then realized i was in a library and it's not cool to throw library books against a wall ..."" i only got through one essay, chosen at random, because i've been curious about this book for a while. i had some time in the library one day and decided to attend to that curiosity. here's my re-enactment of said essay:people don't think because they don't think the same way i do! that's ridiculous! maybe i should fuck with some poor working-class girl and then laugh when my little experiment makes a mess because she doesn't think (the same way i do)! that means she doesn't think! here, let me fuck with some other people who don't think (the same way i do)! it's funny when i'm an asshole! aren't you amused?!?um ... no. no, i'm not. i wanted to give it another shot, to see if it was just that essay, but just glancing through the rest of it i kept encountering other quick glimpses of self-aggrandising ""merriment"" and i put it back on the shelf."
328,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10486715-l,5,"One of the most inspirational books I have read lately. Apart from being one hilarious ride with an adventurous theoretical physicist, this book also reminded me of somewhat forgotten ways of learning, thinking and experimenting in life and academics/career. Feynman comes across as an honest, courageous, fun-filled character who had certain child-like innocence and curiosity in his spirit. The writing will make you laugh, wonder and think. Feynman's free-spirited nature, his attitude of questioning status-quo, his insatiable curiosity, his will to step out of his comfort zone and try new and often difficult things is inspiring, to the extent that one would want to break their present monotonous life and set out for their own adventure!This book demands a permanent place in your library and re-reads."
329,0393355624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222886-aasem-bakhshi,4,"There ain't any books about stubborn men who are among the most curious creatures in the universe, love to play bongos and paint nude models, jump every now and then into sense-deprivation-hallucination-trigger capsules and master the art of moving their egos out of their bodies so that they can watch themselves from outside, can crack any damn safe in the world, steal people's doors, make an atom bomb, experiment with their own dreaming and ant psychology, study at MIT and Princeton, teach at Caltech, start their careers by giving presentation to people like Wolfgang Pauli and Einstein, and end up winning the Nobel prize.So does it make any difference if such a book is written in a sloppy way? No matter how slapdash, it would end up just a tinge less then amazing, due to its extraordinary subject matter. Richard Feynman, may you rest in peace. "
