Back when I was a partying single graduate student, I'd frequently hit the town for some fun. Inevitably I'd meet someone, strike up a conversation, and they might ask me what I did for a living.""Oh, I'm a cosmologist."" ""Cosmetologist? Cool, do you do make-up for movies?"" ""Um...not unless rouge is a component of dark matter."" (ba-da-bum)""...""""I make detectors and use them to study the origins and geometry of our universe."" ""Uh. No way. You ever work in movies?""I discovered after a few years of this that it was much easier and simpler to tell people I was Mary Poppins at Disneyland. Without exception, folks believed me, made a joke and moved on. The physics thing just cause wrinkled faces, and very odd non-sequiturs. Once I had a guy tell me all about a distant cousin who studied shrimp in the Netherlands. Frequently I'd get the physicist = physician mix-up. Luckily no one ever showed me their rash. Oh well, such is the life of the lonely, misunderstood cosmologist.Why am I telling you about all my misadventures in life? Oh yeah, to let you know that my background is observational cosmology. (I.e. making devices, detectors, instruments and doing experiments in labs, in Antarctica and on space-born projects.) I'm not a theorist, and most definitely not into string theory/membrane theory/M-theory. That stuff isn't even touched upon in most graduate programs. It's esoteric, wicked complicated, and honestly still in a very nascent stage.So, I'm not qualified to comment on M-theory being THE answer to The Grand Design as Hawking and Mlodinow so insistently propose. The question then becomes did they sell me on the idea. I dunno... maybe? It was all so very glossed over, overwhelmed by all the history and background needed to give the reader an appropriate framework. Then when they finally game to the climax of the story, where all the previous information should coalesce, M-theory barely got much of an explanation or treatment at all.I got the impression they wanted to push this Grand Idea, a wrap-up of all previous ideas, made with sweeping statements and generalizations to get press. Plus, if it turns out to work and be right, they can point to this very thin book and say ""A-ha!"" That's why I removed a star.Now, if you are looking to learn more about the science of the universe this is just the book for you. They do an excellent job explaining aspects of special relativity, general relativity, particle physics, early-universe physics, even my favorite field, the CMB. (Which maddeningly they call the CMBR, a very outdated term, and refer to the fluctuations as being in the microwave regime, even though they are sub-millimeter radiation! Grrr!) They even throw in a ton of historical context, which helps the reader understand the difficulties of the field and the constantly evolving nature of science.The science is great, you will learn a ton. Really. The writing is clear in that no-nonsense style Hawking is so famous for. Unfortunately in a few areas the explanations get really muddled to the point of incomprehensibility, and I suspect that might be Mlodinow's doing, since those muddled spots fall in his particular area of expertise. One would expect a research scientist in the field (even if she's a lowly experimentalist) should be able to breeze through all their scientific lessons. I found the string theory section to be really tough-going, with pretty poorly thought out examples. But it is a very esoteric field, and maybe there just aren't easy ways to help lay-folks visualize the 11-dimensional space and the vibrating membranes?Speaking of clear teaching examples, the book is filled with ways to help the reader visualize some very hard concepts. Gravity affects space-time like having a rubber sheet for your pool table, then pulling down on one spot right in the middle. The balls will curve around the area in much the same way that objects do near-ish black holes. The ""strings"" in string theory are described to be like a straw, with a surface space, but curled up on itself. However, from very far away a straw looks like a 2-dimensional line.And yet a few of their examples obviously fall short, which I suppose all stand-ins for the real thing will eventually do. The one that really stood out like a a sore thumb was the balloon-as-expanding-universe. Their illustration looks like someone could take a marker and draw little galaxies on a balloon. Then as the balloon is filled with more air and expands, all galaxies will move away from each other independently. The first trouble is that the galaxies, if drawn on, would expand themselves, which doesn't actually happen. (The mass and hence gravity of galaxies is a stronger force than the expansion of the universe.) In the text, it's made clear that the galaxies have to be treated as points on the balloon, but the graphic is a bit misleading. Secondly, the obvious question to the balloon is: Okay, the balloon expands into our 3-dimensional space, so what is the universe expanding into? They certainly touch on the answer later, but never refer back to our balloon. What a shame.At any rate, here's my advice: Believe their grand M-theory answer or don't, I don't think it matters as long as you have learned a few things about our scientific understanding of the universe along the way.Since I made fun of ""The Industry"" suitors I encountered around Los Angeles, I should relate a tale of the foolish physicists. Create a supersymmetry of courtship mishaps or something. I was at a party on campus, which was completely populated by science grad students, and maybe a few random stray people. I met a guy, he seemed nice enough, so we chatted about motorcycles for a while. He asked me what I studied, so I very jokingly told him I was a Theoretical Cosmetologist, and a student at the neighboring university (which has many, many more women). Ridiculous, right? The guy fell for it hook, line and sinker, and wanted to know more details of this theoretical cosmetology. So I told him all about color theory, combining it with an understanding of personality traits, and the effect of shadowing on first-impressions. Meanwhile, my co-workers stood behind him, trying to hold in their laughter. It was mean, but he believed me! If you ever meet me in person, only believe about 63% of what I say. The rest is a joke. And that's a scientifically proven fact."
1,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"When this book was released, I was reading a story about it on-line, and the headline said something like: “Stephen Hawking Says There Is No God”. Then I made the critical mistake of looking at the user comments under the story. It was the usual collection of badly spelled notes from ignorant asshats who tried to say that stupid science didn’t know nuthin’ or that it was all Obama’s fault. But one in particular caught my eye. It was by someone who undoubtedly dabbles in both neurosurgery and rocket science in his-or-her spare time, and it said something along the lines of: “THAT”S WHYY STEVN HAWKENS IS IN WHEEELCHAR!!!!!! BCAUSE HE DON”T BELIVE IN GOD!! JEBUS IS PUNSINGHING HIM!!!”Which got me thinking about why anyone would expect a guy who has suffered from ALS and been confined to a wheelchair for most of his life to believe in God? Among the many people who have just cause to question that a loving God is waiting in heaven to dish them out a heaping plate of Sky Cake, I’d think that Stephen Hawking would be one of them.It’s that kind of thinking that Hawking and Mlodinow take on here. Some people will point out the odds against any kind of life existing on Earth and say that God must have set it all in motion and made this place just for us and that it’s proof of an intelligent creator. Or you listen to a scientist like Hawking who points out that there’s whole multiverses where life doesn’t exist and that the only reason we know how lucky we are is that we exist to appreciate how lucky we are. Basing the idea that there must be some kind of intelligent creator simply because we’re here is bad science.And that’s Hawking’s point. This isn’t an anti-God book, it’s a pro-science and pro-critical thinking book. Hawking does a nice job in the early chapters of giving a brief overview of the development of the scientific method and how beliefs in mysterious beings have been incorporated into theories and then debunked over the centuries. Then he lays out the flaws in the models that insist that there has to be some kind of creator being in the mix. Even though Hawking does his best to dumb down the quantum physics that he claims proves his point and provides lots of handy pictures and graphics to help out the math and science challenged like me, it’s not exactly light reading. It’s short at 181 pages, and that helps, but while I’m fascinated by this kind of stuff, I’m also stupid enough that I had to read over some sections a couple of times before I thought I had a handle on it.It’s enlightening and a nice overview of both the scientific method and quantum physics, but unfortunately, I can’t see any of the people who should read this actually picking it up.

The book examines the history of scientific knowledge about the universe and explains 11 dimension M-theory. The authors of the book point out that a Unified Field Theory (a theory, based on an early model of the universe, proposed by Albert Einstein and other physicists) may not exist.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهارم ماه مارس سال 2012 میلادیسه برگردان فارسی از این کتاب وجود دارد: «علی هادیان و سارا ایزدیار نشر مازیار»؛ «حسین صداقت و امیر امیرآبادی نشر نقش و نگار»؛ «جمیل بصام انتشارات افکار»؛ ا. شاستیون هاوکینگ می‌گویند: ممکن است روشی که کیهان بوجود آمده، هماهنگ با قوانین دانش باشد، که در این صورت نیازی نیست به خدا متوسل بشویم، تا تصمیم بگیریم، که کیهان چگونه آغاز شده‌ است. اگر ما یک فرضیه همه‌ جانبه و کامل را، در مورد پیدایش عالم کشف کنیم، این مهمترین پیروزی انسان خواهد بود، چون ما قادر خواهیم بود، که فکر خدا را بخوانیم...؛ بشر، راز خلقت جهان را گشوده‌ است. جهان می‌تواند بطور خود بخود (خود با خود)، خودش را از هیچ بوجود آورَد، بعلاوه می‌تواند در حالت‌های متفاوت ایجاد شده باشد، و همه ی مشاهدات، و محاسبات بر این نظر صحه می‌گذارند. در سال 1999 میلادی، استیون هاوکینگ، در یک سخنرانی، پس از اشاره به زمان‌های دور، که بشر نخستین برای رویارویی با بیماریهای کشنده، و حوادث طبیعی (سیل و زلزله)، دست به دامان خدایان می‌شد ــ به معنی معکوس به نقش خداوند اشاره نمود و گفتThe future of the universe is not completely determined by the laws of science, and its present state, as Laplace thought.

Stephen Hawking is smarter than I am. That's no big feat because two of my cats are smarter than I am. The other cat is a certifiable idiot. But Hawking is way smarter than I am. The Grand Design is Hawking's explanation, more or less, about why the universe is the way it is. The answer comes down to M-theory which is more of a combining of explanations than one single unifying theory. Many reviewers seem to think Hawking is saying there is no God but he really seems to be stating that God is irrelevant. The real question is did we come from something or nothing. The beginning of an answer involves an understanding of quantum physics and multiverses that Hawking put as well into laymen's term as we can hope for. I don't pretend to understand everything in this book. I'm still contemplating why the world needs hairballs. But I did immensely enjoy reading this short book and can honestly say I understand a little bit more."

More than half were written by the very professors that were teaching me. Quite frankly, it's a giant scam. Those professors have already been paid for the first material through their salaries. Why should we have to pay them again for copies of their pretty badly written books? Yes, these books are very expensive, and many don't deserve to be read. A few years ago, I was asked to review a chapter in a research text. The friend who sent me the invite told me over a drink that I was the third person asked, and would I please go easy on the papers. I said yes."

8,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"I have a feeling that the publishing industry is milking Stephen Hawking. There was a time when we had a dashing physicist named Richard Feynman who used LSD and played banjo in a strip club. The naked pole dancers didn’t distract him from formulating quantum electrodynamics. He was quite a genius, and he was all over the place with his talks and popular books. But he’s dead. Now Stephen Hawking seems to be the coolest physicist around. He’s paralyzed and wheelchair-bound, and he speaks through a voice synthesizer by twitching a tiny working cheek muscle against a screen to pick up a displayed word. How cool is that! So he’s become quite a celebrity, and he fully deserves it. The public is fascinated with him. But that doesn’t mean a whole lot for the quality of his books. I’ve read better pop-physics books than this one. Besides, I didn’t see anything new here. This book got more publicity because it’s supposed to take on the question of God. It’s no secret that the great biologists and physicists tend to be atheists. That’s a very telling fact. But having acknowledged that, I don’t see a point in a physicist trying to “disprove” God through physics. Upon being asked by Napoleon where God fits in his physics, Laplace is reported to having said: “Sire, I have not needed that hypothesis.” Science, by definition, does not and cannot use the God hypothesis. I don’t see why it should get into the business of rejecting that hypothesis. Those who are inclined to reject God can point to the findings of biology and cosmology for support. But that is quite different from a physicist setting out to refute God based on physics. As for the God-rejecting physics – it can be summarized in two points: 1) While no individual physical object can appear out of nothing, an entire universe can. This is because the sum-total of the energy in the universe is zero. 2) There are almost an infinite number of universes popping out of nothing into existence. One of them, like the one where we live, can, by mere chance, have the right properties (laws and constants of physics) for the emergence of starts and planets and eventually life. The book goes into explaining the physics behind these two claims. Unless you’re a physicist as good as Hawking, there’s nothing you can say about his physics. "
9,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5973308-david-boyce,2,"As a cosmologist and a Stephen Hawking fan, I have a real issue with this book. His statement, that the Universe unpacks itself and therefore does not need a creator is based on some really flawed logic called 'model dependent realism'. MDR is a way of comparing reality to a model, if the model produces the same observable characteristics as observed in reality then the model is said to be as true as any other model.Imagine this, if there was equal amounts of incriminating evidence that two people committed a crime and prosecution lawyers could build a case against both men then under MDR both are guilty of the crime irrespective of the fact that it only happened one way. By invoking MDR Hawking is blatantly ignoring the lessons of the past, that evidence makes or breaks models, and so far M-theory is unsupported by evidence.In fact if you follow the line of Hawking's logic, rather than his conclusion, you can even say that Hawking categorically proves the existence of God - All be it as an MDR model of Universe creation. However he selectively ignores this and only looks at how MDR supports his religious beliefs. But, there are a lot of things wrong with this book. Let me explain....Hawking contradicts himself. He says that Kepler, Galileo, Descartes and Newton saw that the laws of physics were the work of God and that this God was not the God the Old Testament. However we do not have enough written down about the religious beliefs off all of the above to know that this is true and this statement is certainly not true for Newton who was as Christian as you could get. Hawking is doing something quite unscientific here, he is trying to re-write history. It is an embarrassment to atheism that some of the greatest geniuses off all time could have a religious belief like the rest of us and so Hawking is trying to apologise for this by making out that somehow the religious beliefs of these scientists were different to that of the rest of the population.Hawking suggests at some points that we must take the Universe at face value, that we must consider real only what is measurably real and then contradicts himself (when talking about the holographic theory) by saying that the Universe may be fundamentally different to how we observe it.Hawking suggests that God doesn’t intervene, and defines intervening as a suspension of the normal laws of physics. But what about intervention using the laws of physics. What about a God that intervenes only rarely. Under MDR all are as real as a God that never intervenes. Hawking laughs at the idea that we might all be the figment of someone else’s dream, but under the logic he himself invokes, this theory is as real as M-theory.Hawking describes how our perception of reality can be changed by placing upside down glasses on our faces. Our minds are so set in their ways that they refuse the new reality and change the input to fit with the model of the reality in our heads. In MDR the model each person has in their heads is a real reality. Reality is unique to each observer. If God exists in my model, it is true for my Universe, if he doesn’t in yours then God really is absent from yours.Hawking describes how St Augustine concluded that the Earth was young due to the ages of people in the bible, but at the time there was no recognised evidence to suggest otherwise. According to MDR young Earth creationism was the reality, since no other model existed. He says that young Earth creationism in the present day is as real as the big bang theory. But Hawking is breaking his own logic here. In today’s day and age we have a lot more evidence that the Universe began with something like the big bang which means that under MDR, this model is considered to be MORE real.Hawking describes how Hubble’s model of the Universe was accepted because it was the most natural model but naturalness and elegance is purely subjective. In MDR plausibility is not measured. Hawking mentions how the laws of nature determine a range of probabilities of various futures and past, and yet avoids the issue about how a selection is made. Somehow a selection IS made.Hawking describes how the Universe is comprehensible because it can be modelled. This is not true. Only the model is comprehensible. The Universe is not the model; the Universe is infinite and by its very nature incomprehensible and thanks to quantum physics not even entirely measurable.The bits that really make me cringe, and I have a degree and a PhD in this, is where Hawking gets his science wrong. Hawking suggests that the standard model “agrees with all current evidence”, but this is not true. Experiments have observed that the neutrino has mass, and the standard model cannot account for this.Hawking suggests that inflation in the early Universe really did happen, but recent observations by his old friend Roger Penrose have cast serious doubts over this. Hawking also suggests that this Universe is casually disconnected from the other possibilities, and so what we experience is just one possibility. However M-theory suggests that gravity information leaks between membranes, thus collapsing the universe into one possibility. This one.Hawking suggests the Universe has 4 dimensions of space time as the result of our selection. In his words the Universe is like this because this is one of the possibilities it could have been and our selection is this. But as Einstein said, “God doesn’t play dice”. To suggest that some thing’s have no fundamental reason for existing is like saying “Everybody stop all scientific research, because there is no fundamental reason for any of this”.Hawking also suggests that the act of creation is understandable purely within the realm of science, but doesn’t mention that we have no science that works at t=0. The science goof that nearly had me eating my kindle in apoplexy was when Hawking suggests that black holes have positive gravitational potential energy. If that were true, the milky way would be spread around the Universe. Hawking does do well at talking his way out of the fine tuning argument. He effectively kills that argument dead and I agree we do not need God to explain why the Universe is perfect for our existence. But my reply is that, people shouldn’t have been using that line of apologism in the first place because it doesn’t make theological sense, let alone scientific sense. According to Christian doctrine God made creation for himself, he did not make it for us.Hawking does well at explaining how quantum mechanics and relativity on intermediate scales produce Newtonian like physics. This is the Hawking we know and love and this book should have been full of this kind of stuff. Instead it is full of laughable pseudoscience and theology. Model dependent realism is not robust enough for Hawking’s confidence in it and doesn’t hold up to scrutiny or close inspection.The theological work in this is very much of the style of Dawkins and others who successfully disprove Gods of their own imagining. They create a God, give it powers and then disprove the God that they have created. But they don’t get anywhere near the God that people worship in churches. Hawking’s intellect outstrips his own imagination and it really shows in this work. I am very happily the other way around."

01.11.2016: Stephen Hawking warns that the Higgs Boson field could collapse, resulting in a chain reaction that would take in the whole universe with it.
 The nihilists have been right all along...M-theory: Doubts linger over godless multiverseSTEPHEN HAWKING'S new book The Grand Design sparked a furore over whether physics can be used to disprove the existence of God. But few have noted that the idea at the core of the book, M-theory, is the subject of an ongoing scientific debate – specifically over the very aspect of the theory that might scrap the need for a divine creator.That the laws of nature in our universe are finely tuned for life seems miraculous, leading some to invoke divine involvement. But if there is a multiverse out there – a multitude of universes, each with its own laws of physics – then the conditions we observe may not be unique.Source"

On the flip side, I had several light bulb moments, which is always nice.Among other things, Hawking makes a few great points particularly about the essence of ""reality.""And this passage below, which touches on free will, intrigued me.How can one tell if a being has free will? If one encounters an alien, how can one tell if it is just a robot or it has a mind of its own? The behavior of a robot would be completely determined, unlike that of a being with free will. Thus one could in principle detect a robot as a being whose actions can be predicted. As we said in Chapter 2, this may be impossibly difficult if the being is large and complex. We cannot even solve exactly the equations for three or more particles interacting with each other. Since an alien the size of a human would contain about a thousand trillion trillion particles even if the alien were a robot, it would be impossible to solve the equations and predict what it would do. We would therefore have to say that any complex being has free will--not as a fundamental feature, but as an effective theory, an admission of our inability to do the calculation that would enable us to predict its actions.So basically free will is an illusion, but given our inability to tease out all the complex biological processes that contribute to behavior, it is a good working theory for practical purposes. Thought this was an interesting way of looking at it.Worthy book, well written, and as good an attempt as any to simplify some very complex topics."

There were a couple of sections that I re-read, in an attempt to make concrete some of the more abstract aspects of m-theory. Despite my rudimentary understanding of quantum physics, I still gleaned a great deal from this book and would recommend it to anyone who is even mildly curious. Those who have a more advanced education in physics may find this book too basic, especially the earlier chapters.Questions such as ""What occurred before the big bang?"" and ""what instigated the creation of the universe?"" are addressed in the last chapter, and the earlier chapters build up a nice base of prior research for those unfamiliar with m-theory.

As is the case with most such gifts, I began to read it immediately.I was almost immediately turned off by the text owing to an extraordinary display of ignorance on the part of the authors and the editors, a mistake appearing in the first few pages in their lead-up to what is supposed to be a survey of the history of physics as germinated in Ionian philosophy. Here they note in passing that writing was first employed around 7000 BCE. In fact, so far as we've evidence, writing first appeared about 6000 years ago, in Sumer in approximately 4000 BCE.To make matters worse the authors go on glibly to dismiss philosophy as defunct--not too surprising as their review of it doesn't display much familiarity with the discipline.Beyond this, I found the jokes peppering this slim volume condescending yet sophomoric, unfunny and far too frequent.As regards the physics, I'm hardly qualified the judge, lacking as I do the background in mathematics and research physics to evaluate their positions. However, as someone with some background in philosophy and in the history of science, I find nothing original in their M theory business, such contextualization being rather old hat.There are many fine books written for generalists which attempt to explain modern cosmology and microphysics. This is not one of them."

At first we are told about the concept of formation of universe in the earlier times. From ancient Greeks to Galileo, Newton to Feynman , basic classical theories to the formulation of M-theory , this books tries to explain the fundamental questions related to Universe. It's a very good book if you are striving to comprehend the Universe scientifically . And the explanation is simple enough for a normal high school student to understand."
16,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6638317-jill,5,"STEPHEN HAWKING WRITES VERY CLEARLY.That's like the big glaring thing I need to express with this review. Are you worried you won't understand science because it's dense and dry and has diagrams instead of pictures? This is the book for you, then -- short, succinct, full-colour, and most importantly: clearly explained. The concepts here are intense and heady, but Hawking (and Mlodinow) write about them in a way you can actually understand. The mathematics are lacking, so this is definitely pop-science (and when I tried to explain an experiment referenced to a friend, I realized I wasn't completely sure when or who had conducted it, so..a bibliography would have been nice?). It's like a cosmology buffet: chronologically organized, mostly, from mythology to M-theory, with a sampling of the ideas therein. You'll need to delve further for a real meaty meal, but as appetizers: this shit is high-class. I don't know that I loved it, but it did express wacko concepts in a way a layman can grasp, and if that's all it set out to do: kudos & job well done.Also the Fibonacci spirals at the end of each chapter kind of made my life ngl <3"
17,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9512361-andrew-langridge,1,"There are only a couple of positives that I can think to say about this book. Firstly, Hawking has some Feynman-like qualities in being able to lucidly express important ideas in physics such as time dilation in special relativity and the double slit experiment. Secondly, his philosophy of science that he calls model-based realism has many things going for it, although why it is called realism is never fully explained. I did not find this book particularly easy to read, probably because I did not believe from the outset that I was going to be enlightened about our origins.Hawking states ""Philosophy is dead"", but scientists should be especially circumspect when trying to extrapolate their ideas into the humanities. Contemporary readers are still able to detect an elusive thread of truth running through all great philosophical works, and that, like the great works of art, they certainly have not been superseded by developments in science. Scientists meddling in the humanities often give the impression of never having studied the subjects they are criticising and tend to make 'straw man' arguments. The question 'why are we here?' is supposedly solved by science, but is of much more profound significance than Hawking credits. We feel our lives to have value as well as function and our desire throughout history to find life meaningful cannot be dismissed as lacking any significance. 'Is there a creator?' I have no particular axe to grind in favour of religion, but Hawking hypocritically rehashes ancient philosophical arguments for the non-existence of God, such as ""who created God?"". Moreover, religions cannot be treated simply as ontologies devoid of all the mythical elements that have inspired some of the greatest products of art and civilisation. Indeed, Weber tells us that science itself was given impetus by Protestantism.Hawking spends a long time discussing 'anthropic' arguments, but I don't understand their significance. It is only strange that the universe has these particular values for the universal constants or that the Earth's orbit has this narrow range of orbital parameters leading to the evolution of humanity if you have some reference point outside the universe to assess it from. We are doing science from the perspective of the human race as we are here and now, so of course the universe appears to us to be evolved to suit us, otherwise we would not be here to do the science. Hawking advances M Theory as the key to explaining the universe. I am not sufficiently qualified to give an opinion on this, but one thing it seems possible to say is that 'multiverse' theories are unique in science not only for never having been tested but also for being impossible to test. A far-fetched theory for why the dinosaurs died out at least has the possibility of being tested against palaeontological evidence. Any notions we entertain to make the concept of causality apply beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause. I agree with Pliny (ancient wisdom that Hawking dismisses) who states the impossibility of measuring the universe or understanding how it arose. To me, 'universe' by definition means everything that exists, so how can there be any reference point outside it from which to measure it? Cosmological physics turns out paradoxes by the dozen. If the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into? What caused the big bang? If we need mathematics to explain this, what makes us so sure we can rely on mathematics? And what about reasoning itself? What is truth? Oh darn it - another philosophical question!"
18,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1777325-julia,3,"I own several of Hawking's books, and so I was drawn to this thin volume. Obviously his co-author did most of the work, since Hawking's health continues to deteriorate. Mlodinow is a physicist at Caltech and an author in his own right. His name should appear as co-author, but my cynical brain thinks the publisher felt Hawking's name would sell more copies.Much time is given to Richard Feynman and his work in quantum physics. In fact, this book promotes the study of quantum theory as the main answer to human questions about existence. The book does a decent job of tracing the historical ways in which humans tried to comprehend the universe, but it does so in an egotistical way that bothers me. The very first page says ""philosophy is dead"" and advocates science as the only TRUE way to approach the deep human questions about the universe and our place in it.While I do hold science as the basis of my belief system, I'm just a bit concerned that Hawking put his name to a book that occasionally ""sniggers"" at the ides of earlier thinkers. Just because Ptolomy's design of the universe has been proven wrong should not denigrate the desire of his mind to understand the universe.So while I found some of the ideas interesting, WHOEVER really wrote this book comes across as rather egotistical. The sections on quantum theory are very complex, and I had to skip over some of the more esoteric parts.I've always found Hawking's books to be centered on his fascination with understanding this universe. In none of them did I ever find the condescention that is part of this book, and that's a danger for a scientist. Humility should be as important to a scientist as to a philosopher--Socrates knew that when he said he realized the Oracle of Delphi had claimed he was the wisest man in the world. He realized he WAS the wisest man only when he came to his famous conclusion that he ""knew nothing"". This book needed that humility lesson."

21,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35532567-alex,5,"He can get quite technical at times but overall a cogent read. In the end, he jumped a little for me. For example, here he tries to refute that a creator is required:""If the total energy of the universe must always remain zero, and it costs energy to create a body, how can a whole universe be created from nothing? That is why there must be a law like gravity. Because gravity is attractive, gravitational energy is negative: one has to do work to separate a gravitationally bound system... black holes have positive energy [and they balance out the negative energy]. That's why empty space is stable. [that is, a body cannot appear in empty space.] Bodies such as stars or black holes cannot just appear out of nothing. But a whole universe can.Because gravity shapes space and time, it allows space-time to be locally stable but globally unstable. On the scale of the entire universe, the positive energy of the matter can be balanced by the negative gravitational enerby, and so there is no restriction on the creation of whole universes."" (p.180) Nevertheless, it's difficult to find a book of this length that does a better job at explaining some pretty mind-blowing concepts."
22,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"Ever since I was little, I remember the image of Stephen Hawking from TV. I don't know why, but he remained embroidered in my brain after watching a TV show that spoke of him. This must have been 10 years ago, or something like that, but when it was explained to me what he was and what he was doing and did and why he looked the way he looked (remember I was 7 or 8 so I was bound to ask hurtful questions), I became to develop this fondness towards him. In my late years (oh, I'm soooo old), when I was 15 or something like that I started searching information about his work. Now, we have to be clear on one point. I do not, never did and probably (though hopefully not) never will understand physics. It has always been beyond my grasp and I sucked ass at it both at school and at home. Physics for me has to be explained in words and verbal theories. When you lay formulas on a paper, you lost me. And I mean really lost me. This bad understanding of mine is somewhat minimized by the fact that once I understood and learned something, I will never forget it. My memory is really good, and I'm proud to say I've learned a bit of physics both in school and outside of it, just by having it explained over and over again by patient friends that took their time with me. Now, when it comes to anything more complex than normal, simple, high school physics, you lost me again. Quantum physics is something that is absolutely and completely beyond my grasp. Still, in this little book of his, Stephen Hawking managed to explain some things to me, not just me but all of us who read the book. And after finishing it, I felt like I kinda/sorta understood them. Now I know that Stephen Hawking himself isn't able to ""write"" a book. But I've been doing my research and I found out some amazing things about him. The way he pours his thoughts on a paper is by help of his assistant, who sits next to him and asks him simple questions like ""what word are you searching for?"". Then he goes on to trials ""reassuring? reassured? reassure?"". Whenever Hawking agrees to a word, he slightly blinks. Whenever he doesn't, he grins. This is painstaking work. It's horribly slow and you have to be incredibly patient in order to do that. It's monumental work, really, and it deserves respect. Another thing I found out about Stephen Hawking that really impressed me was the fact that when he realized he wouldn't be able to write on a paper and make written calculations of his theories, he developed, inside his mind, a way of ""looking at the universe"". Put simply, there's 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D. We people see 3D. Hawking has developed a means through which he sees, or better imagines in 4D, the dimension that includes time. Isn't that awesome?! I've barely learned to read and write in my whole life! Anyways. I feel like I turned this review into an essay about how great Hawking is. Oh well. Read the book. Read his other books. You'll understand more when you finish them. "

The book gives a good answer to the so-called ""anthropic principle""--namely, that the laws of physics and the fundamental constants appear to be perfectly tuned to allow our world, life, and humans to develop. If any of the laws or fundamental constants were to deviate even slightly, life might not be even possible.The answer to this dilemma, the authors state, is not that God created the laws of physics, and the answer is not that, by some fantastic coincidence, the laws of physics just happen to be perfect. Instead, an infinite number of universes have been created, each with its own unique set of laws. The book is interesting, but seems to fall down in the last chapter, titled, The Grand Design. In the last chapter, the authors argue that M-Theory is the only candidate theory that explains the universe--but that it has not yet been verified by observation. In fact, the authors state that M-Theory has not yet been fully developed; only some characteristics of the theory have been described. The wide, sweeping statements and conclusions made in the last chapter just don't seem to satisfy me."

27,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"I make no secret about the fact that I love science, and of all the sciences, I will make no secret about my love for physics, for theoretical physics, and for cosmology. These fields help us understand the universe, that crazy thing that’s all around us, and the fact that we have come so far is simply amazing. In The Grand Design, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow reflect upon how physics achieves this understanding of the universe, with a particular emphasis on how physics can explain the origin of the universe in a way that removes the need for a deity (whom we’ll call God).Mlodinow gets his name on the cover, but this is clearly a Hawking book first and foremost. His name is bigger, and the inside of the dust jacket begins, “The first major work in nearly a decade by one of the world’s great thinkers…"" (emphasis mine). Sorry, Mlodinow! You’re a nice guy, but I guess you’re just not a “great thinker”. (Actually, although I think I’d heard of him before, this is the first time I have encountered one of his “his” books, and now I can go and mark down a bunch of his other books to read. But I should probably talk about this book now.)I shall hereafter refer to Hawking and Mlodinow as “H&M” because it tickles my fancy to fantasize that a clothing chain might write a book on physics.The Grand Design is certainly an engaging treatise, but it is also problematic. I had a lot of fun reading it, and although I have a lot of experience reading about science, I feel confident recommending it for people who might otherwise quirk an eyebrow and say, “Erm … science? I don’t know….” It’s a very short book; it’s extremely conversational in tone, with plenty of analogies; and there are no tests at the end. There are even pictures (albeit not very good ones)! By problematic I mean that, from my own reading and from what I have read of reviews here on Goodreads, H&M confront the role of physics vis-à-vis religion in a way that doesn’t lend itself to clarity and suasion. There seems to be a disconnect between the evidence they present (which is very good) and how they phrase or otherwise communicate the conclusions they draw. This results in an ambiguity that means people will often misinterpret those conclusions or dismiss them out of hand. The Grand Design, one might say, suffers from a grand design flaw.(I am so sorry for that last sentence.)I can give an example from the very first page of the book, which, by the way, begins not with a foreword, preface, or introduction, but Chapter 1. It’s true that this first chapter is very much an introductory chapter that lays the ground for the rest of the book, but I have to give H&M and their editors credit for not subjecting us to another scientist pontificating about these guys or a token preface. The conciseness of this book is appreciated, even if it leads to pithy statements like this:Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.As someone who unequivocally supports science as a way to discover and understand the universe, I must nevertheless shake my head at this passage. Taken literally, it seems like an unnecessarily harsh indictment of philosophy, particularly contemporary philosophy, which is very much alive. Even leaving aside philosophy that concerns itself with things other than those questions (such as “Who are we? Where did we come from?”), philosophers routinely discuss developments in science in their philosophy. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that most scientists also become philosophers—as you will see if you read this book, it is clear that H&M are. However, to be fair to them, I think that what H&M are trying to distinguish—albeit sensationally—is the difference between purely attempting to reason about our existence and our origins (rationalism) and using tools to collect data and make inferences about that existence and those origins (empiricism). The program founded in the Western world by Aristotle and raised onto a pedestal by the Enlightenment scientists has failed: we cannot know the world through reason alone. Bacon, Newton, Galileo, Franklin, etc., realized that we must experiment—we have to conduct tests that anyone with the appropriate knowledge and equipment can reproduce. So philosophy alone cannot take us the entire way, and science provides that next crucial step.If you haven’t read the book, and especially if you approach physics with more wariness than I do, you will find this very weird, but I found the first half of the book much heavier than the last half (with one notable exception). Following that incendiary introductory passage, H&M segue into a deep discussion of what science is, where it is coming from, and where it might be going. Specifically, they introduce a concept called model-dependent realism. And I think this is a fascinating, perhaps even peculiar decision on their part, because I doubt many of their readers would have ever heard of this term—whereas, in comparison, even most laypeople will have heard words like “quantum mechanics” and “general relativity”. H&M have great confidence in their audience, for they have faith that the audience will not be deterred when they drop some philosophy of science in the first chapter.It makes sense to talk about model-dependent realism, though, because it is relevant to M-theory, which is the group of theories that H&M discuss as a candidate for the ultimate “theory of everything”. And kudos to H&M for trying to pull back the curtain on the somewhat mystical way “theories” are constructed and viewed (at least by some scientists). In particular, I love the analogy they use with a map of the world: we can’t accurately transfer a three-dimensional sphere to a two-dimensional surface, so no matter what projection we use (e.g., Mercator, Robinson), it will always be distorted. So just as different projections provide different but useful models of our world, different theories provide different but useful models of the universe. Some of these theories have been collected under the name “M-theory”, and together they might be “the answer” when none of them alone could make the cut.Of course, I like model-dependent realism, because I am a realist, and as H&M say, it “short-circuits all this argument and discussion between the realist and anti-realist schools of thought”. I won’t go into realism versus anti-realism here; that is probably best left for a deeper discussion of the philosophy of science. Suffice it to say, science is not about establishing a single, fixed “truth” outlined by a single set of theories. As H&M point out, Ptolemy and Kepler’s model of a geocentric orbit using epicycles is as valid as our heliocentric model—one certainly can regard the rest of the solar system as “orbiting” the Earth. Yet the geocentric model is fiendishly complex and quickly becomes unwieldy if one ever wants to perform actual calculations; the heliocentric model has the advantage of being simpler and more elegant. So these are all thoughts that H&M want us to consider as they launch into an overview of the state of physics in the twenty-first century.I like that H&M go to the trouble of distinguishing between “probability” as we use the term colloquially and the role probability plays in quantum mechanics. Nancy Kress discusses probability in quantum mechanics at length in 
Probability Sun
, but she only alludes to the difference rather than explicates it. Quantum mechanics is weird and strange and revolutionary precisely because of one word: uncertainty. It blew away the classical world, particularly the deterministic aspect. That pesky Heisenberg uncertainty principle means we’ll never know exactly where a particle is and how fast it is moving. Hence, according to quantum mechanics, asking where a particle is is a meaningless question. Rather, ask what the probability is of a particle being in a particular point in space-time. There is a probability that all the particles in my left arm might actually be in Switzerland right now, but the probability is tiny compared to the probability that they are, in fact, attached to my left shoulder! (And for this I am thankful.)Similarly, The Grand Design finally clarified for me what a boson is. I just have these song lyrics stuck in my head:They suppose that particles have mass becauseThere is this Higgs field that extends through all spaceAnd some particles slow down while other particles raceStraight through like the photon — it has no massBut something heavy like the top quark, it’s draggin’ its ***And the Higgs is a boson that carries a forceAnd makes particles take orders from the field that is its source.If you haven’t already seen it, the Large Hadron Rap is one of the most amazing science raps I have ever seen, and it does an excellent job at explaining what scientists are trying to achieve using the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, I still wasn’t clear on this idea of bosons and force fields. Something about the way H&M explain bosons in The Grand Design finally made it click for me:… according to classical theories, forces are transmitted by fields. But in quantum ield theories the force fields are pictured as being made of various elementary particles called bosons, which are force-carrying particles that fly back and forth between matter particles, transmitting the forces.So the field and particle are dual concepts, one of which applies to classical theories (like relativity) while the other applies to quantum theory. Particles are the language of quantum mechanics, and so force fields have been replaced by a particle that conveys each force: photons for electromagnetism, gluons for the strong force, W and Z bosons for the weak force, and perhaps gravitons for gravity (we haven’t found them yet!). That’s really cool, and I am glad H&M cleared that up for me. This is why I read so many books that cover the same scientific concepts, even similar books by one author: each different method of explaining a concept aids my understanding in some small way.This kind of incremental learning is present in science as well. H&M mention, “Modern technology is sensitive enough to allow us to perform many sensitive tests of general relativity, and it has passed every one”. That relativity is testable and falsifiable—and, correspondingly, has passed all of the tests we have thus far devised—lends great credence to its accuracy as a scientific model. There are, of course, more subtle questions about the roles of testability and falsification play in judging a scientific theory (e.g.: Evolution is arguably not testable, nor is string theory.) What’s important is that H&M emphasize that science is not some kind of mysterious black box where we plug in data in order to obtain inviolable laws of nature. So that’s why I’m fine with people criticizing, say, evolution, because all science should be open to criticism—but the moment that criticism rests on an objection like “it’s only a ‘theory’!” I will stop listening. Our scientific principles are theories because science is self-correcting and constantly improving upon and revising those principles. That is why science is so powerful, so important, and so very cool.By far the most mind-boggling concept in The Grand Design comes at the end, and it is the exception to my earlier remark that I find the first part of the book the heaviest in terms of mental exertion. The ultimate thesis of this book is that we can explain the origin of the universe without invoking a creator deity, a God. I think it is very important to note that H&M are not saying that science can disprove the existence of God, nor is that an objective of The Grand Design. While it is clear that H&M, like myself, do not believe a God exists, this is not their argument. Instead, they are merely removing the necessity of God’s existence. I can see how one can misinterpret the book—hence my initial comments about the disconnect and design flaw. H&M’s scepticism is vividly demonstrated, and they raise some of the problems with attempting to fit God into cosmogony—namely, if God created the universe, who created God? If the answer is that “God is eternal and has always been here,” then why can’t we just replace “God” with “the universe” and leave it at that?This might seem impossible, for we know the universe is not eternal in that sense: we can measure its age (with some degree of precision), and it’s only 13.7 billion years old! Moreover, we know that the universe will eventually reach some sort of end, whether it is heat death, a Big Crunch, etc. H&M resolve this, and that unfortunate singularity at the origin of the universe that prevents our physics from explaining anything, by saying:In the early universe—when the universe was small enough to be governed by both general relativity and quantum theory—there were effectively four dimensions of space and none of time. That means that when we speak of the “beginning” of the universe, we are skirting the subtle issue that as we look backward toward the very early universe, time as we know it does not exist! We must accept that our usual ideas of space and time do not apply to the very early universe.Read that twice: asking what happened “before” the universe existed is meaningless, because time itself did not exist as we regard it today. If that sounds too strange and too incredible to accept, believe me: you are certainly not alone. Much like my experience with bosons, I am only now, after confronting this several times, beginning to wrap my head around this explanation. We are just so obsessed with our view of linear time that thinking of a universe where time functions differently boggles our intuition. It is definitely the most difficult concept H&M present in this book, and as with some of their other explanations, I do not think they entirely succeed in presenting it the way they probably hoped.The Grand Design is ambitious. It is also brief and conversational, as physics books go, and at times this runs up against that ambition. As someone who loves the philosophy of science, loves physics, and has read quite a lot of books about physics, I enjoyed The Grand Design and found it enlightening. Although I recommend it to others with less experience, because it really is a very accessible book, I do so with one reservation: if this is your first physics book, don’t let it be your last. There are so many good ones out there, and while The Grand Design is a fine place to start, it is not the last word on the theory of everything.

28,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120477-jacob,3,"I've read snippets of Hawking's books before and enjoyed them. The particular theme of this one interested me so I picked it up. It started out with some creation myths and a well-paced history of bigger picture science. It bogged down in the middle with an exploration of quantam physics that the author felt was necessary for his subsequent theory of Grand Design, but in reality did little for his theory or the book as a whole.In fact, while engaging, fun to read, and highly informative, the book falls flat at the end. The line of reasoning, from my perspective, leaves much to be desired. Consider a few quotes from the last chapter:""It is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, the the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. In this view it is accepted that some entity exists that needs no creator, and that entity is called God. We claim, however, that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings""While I find the philosophical question of who created God, highly intriguing, I think Mr. Hawking confuses the fact that we are constantly finding laws that govern existence, thereby explaining what we thought was only attributable to divine interference as proof that the divine does not exist. Take this next quote:""Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.""Really? Is it any less plausible that the universe just started randomly 13 billion years ago than a supreme being created it? Either line of thought requires a good amount of faith to believe in. It reminds me of C.S. Lewis' arguments for the existence of God and how they all fell short if you did not start from the premise of belief in something more than the random universe--ultimately you have to believe one way or the other and no amount of ""proof"" will stand up to scrutiny because there is simply too much we don't know.Regarding the Grand Design itself:""M-theory is the UNIFIED [caps mine] theory Einstein was hoping to find. The fact that we human beings-who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature-have been able to come this close to understanding of the laws governing us and our universe is a great triumph...If the theory is confirmed by observation, it will be the successful conclusion of a search going back more than 3000 years. We will have found the grand design.""This is from the last paragraph in the book. The problem is that there is nothing unified about M-theory. Hawking states this in his opening chapter and we learn later in the book that M-theory takes into account electromagnetism, strong forces, weak forces, and string theory in order to produce a multi-verse version of reality that includes 10 to the 500th power possibilities. Not only is this pretty far from fathomable to the average man, but it violates his first two principle of a good model from chapter 3, ""A model is a good model if it: 1. Is elegant 2. Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements"". A convoluted mish-mash of theories that produces so many various elements (mathematically computable or not) is hardly a ""good model"". Due to the sheer volume of calculations necessary it is hard to confirm fulfillment of the last two criteria that the good model: ""3. Agrees with and explains all existing observations 4. Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can disprove or falsify the model if they are not borne out.""Don't get me wrong. I am no quantam physicist nor cosmologist and certainly don't have the knowledge to disprove any theories in these fields. Likely we are on the right track with something like M-theory. However, it is not an easily understood unified theory (such may not even exist), and it certainly doesn't provide any answers about the why of the universe as it claims to. As with much of both science and religion, the more we learn and understand, the more questions arise.The poor finishing premises of this book and agonizingly thick explanations in the middle of this work, knock it down two notches, but it is still worth the read if this sort of thing interests you. Solid 3 stars."

There is another theory which states that this has already happened.”(Douglas Adams)This book totally agrees with that, in the end. I have this book because my sixteen-year-old stepson had to buy it for a class he was going to take, and then decided not to take the class. Perhaps that’s why I so strongly perceive it as written toward a “younger” audience. But, as with a lot of things written by very intelligent people toward an audience they knew to be dumber than they are, there are a lot of jokes that sort of insult your intelligence without really meaning to. You know, the kind of jokes that make teenagers really roll their eyes, which is especially bad when they’re in there to try to “relate to” the very people who roll their eyes at it.In talking about the Stoics describing “physical processes in legal terms and [believing] them to be in need of enforcement, even though the objects required to ‘obey’ the laws were inanimate”: “If you think it is hard to get humans to follow traffic laws, imagine convincing an asteroid to move along an ellipse.”It tends to be distracting and awkward and tacked-in-there. And it’s not needed; the book’s written in simple language, and it’s exceedingly easy to read, which makes it easy to be interested in it so long as one has at least a little interest in the subject anyway--which is not something these jokes would induce in any case. Still, it wasn’t enough to really degrade my opinion of the book.I did get a little frustrated with the over-simplification of things here and there, because so many times that kind of thing leaves out the explanations I come into this kind of thing looking for. And when I get all frustrated like that, I miss things, which was my main problem in college. The teachers tend to want to get to this point or that point and spit out some model along the way that I’d really like to dwell on, but their explanation is, “It exists because we need it for the equation all of us are on now so come on, come on.”I don’t even like to think about how long it took me to finally figure out where π came from and why we use it, and how frustrated I was with teachers who kept telling me, “Just feed your numbers into the formula and give the damn answer.”But I only hit that wall, really, there in the middle. The thing I found most useful about the book was the scientific history lessons. Reminders of when people like Newton and Aristotle lived, and just what they came up with---before we modified and reworded it. That was my favorite aspect of the book by far.My other favorite thing was the introduction to John Conway’s Game of Life. And I can’t believe I’ve never run across it before. How completely and utterly baffling, to me, that I never have. (Or maybe I have and it was just never presented in such a memorable way?) You can even download it and play with it as a “game”: http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/I’m not sure either of those links can show at all why I love the implications so much (because I haven’t actually read through those sites), but to explain I have to plagiarize pages of this book, so I’ll leave it be. And maybe call a buddy to see if he can download Life for me. Heh."

Back when I was a partying single graduate student, I'd frequently hit the town for some fun. Inevitably I'd meet someone, strike up a conversation, and they might ask me what I did for a living.""Oh, I'm a cosmologist."" ""Cosmetologist? Cool, do you do make-up for movies?"" ""Um...not unless rouge is a component of dark matter."" (ba-da-bum)""...""""I make detectors and use them to study the origins and geometry of our universe."" ""Uh. No way. You ever work in movies?""I discovered after a few years of this that it was much easier and simpler to tell people I was Mary Poppins at Disneyland. Without exception, folks believed me, made a joke and moved on. The physics thing just cause wrinkled faces, and very odd non-sequiturs. Once I had a guy tell me all about a distant cousin who studied shrimp in the Netherlands. Frequently I'd get the physicist = physician mix-up. Luckily no one ever showed me their rash. Oh well, such is the life of the lonely, misunderstood cosmologist.Why am I telling you about all my misadventures in life? Oh yeah, to let you know that my background is observational cosmology. (I.e. making devices, detectors, instruments and doing experiments in labs, in Antarctica and on space-born projects.) I'm not a theorist, and most definitely not into string theory/membrane theory/M-theory. That stuff isn't even touched upon in most graduate programs. It's esoteric, wicked complicated, and honestly still in a very nascent stage.So, I'm not qualified to comment on M-theory being THE answer to The Grand Design as Hawking and Mlodinow so insistently propose. The question then becomes did they sell me on the idea. I dunno... maybe? It was all so very glossed over, overwhelmed by all the history and background needed to give the reader an appropriate framework. Then when they finally game to the climax of the story, where all the previous information should coalesce, M-theory barely got much of an explanation or treatment at all.I got the impression they wanted to push this Grand Idea, a wrap-up of all previous ideas, made with sweeping statements and generalizations to get press. Plus, if it turns out to work and be right, they can point to this very thin book and say ""A-ha!"" That's why I removed a star.Now, if you are looking to learn more about the science of the universe this is just the book for you. They do an excellent job explaining aspects of special relativity, general relativity, particle physics, early-universe physics, even my favorite field, the CMB. (Which maddeningly they call the CMBR, a very outdated term, and refer to the fluctuations as being in the microwave regime, even though they are sub-millimeter radiation! Grrr!) They even throw in a ton of historical context, which helps the reader understand the difficulties of the field and the constantly evolving nature of science.The science is great, you will learn a ton. Really. The writing is clear in that no-nonsense style Hawking is so famous for. Unfortunately in a few areas the explanations get really muddled to the point of incomprehensibility, and I suspect that might be Mlodinow's doing, since those muddled spots fall in his particular area of expertise. One would expect a research scientist in the field (even if she's a lowly experimentalist) should be able to breeze through all their scientific lessons. I found the string theory section to be really tough-going, with pretty poorly thought out examples. But it is a very esoteric field, and maybe there just aren't easy ways to help lay-folks visualize the 11-dimensional space and the vibrating membranes?Speaking of clear teaching examples, the book is filled with ways to help the reader visualize some very hard concepts. Gravity affects space-time like having a rubber sheet for your pool table, then pulling down on one spot right in the middle. The balls will curve around the area in much the same way that objects do near-ish black holes. The ""strings"" in string theory are described to be like a straw, with a surface space, but curled up on itself. However, from very far away a straw looks like a 2-dimensional line.And yet a few of their examples obviously fall short, which I suppose all stand-ins for the real thing will eventually do. The one that really stood out like a a sore thumb was the balloon-as-expanding-universe. Their illustration looks like someone could take a marker and draw little galaxies on a balloon. Then as the balloon is filled with more air and expands, all galaxies will move away from each other independently. The first trouble is that the galaxies, if drawn on, would expand themselves, which doesn't actually happen. (The mass and hence gravity of galaxies is a stronger force than the expansion of the universe.) In the text, it's made clear that the galaxies have to be treated as points on the balloon, but the graphic is a bit misleading. Secondly, the obvious question to the balloon is: Okay, the balloon expands into our 3-dimensional space, so what is the universe expanding into? They certainly touch on the answer later, but never refer back to our balloon. What a shame.At any rate, here's my advice: Believe their grand M-theory answer or don't, I don't think it matters as long as you have learned a few things about our scientific understanding of the universe along the way.Since I made fun of ""The Industry"" suitors I encountered around Los Angeles, I should relate a tale of the foolish physicists. Create a supersymmetry of courtship mishaps or something. I was at a party on campus, which was completely populated by science grad students, and maybe a few random stray people. I met a guy, he seemed nice enough, so we chatted about motorcycles for a while. He asked me what I studied, so I very jokingly told him I was a Theoretical Cosmetologist, and a student at the neighboring university (which has many, many more women). Ridiculous, right? The guy fell for it hook, line and sinker, and wanted to know more details of this theoretical cosmetology. So I told him all about color theory, combining it with an understanding of personality traits, and the effect of shadowing on first-impressions. Meanwhile, my co-workers stood behind him, trying to hold in their laughter. It was mean, but he believed me! If you ever meet me in person, only believe about 63% of what I say. The rest is a joke. And that's a scientifically proven fact."

Then I made the critical mistake of looking at the user comments under the story. It was the usual collection of badly spelled notes from ignorant asshats who tried to say that stupid science didn’t know nuthin’ or that it was all Obama’s fault. But one in particular caught my eye. It was by someone who undoubtedly dabbles in both neurosurgery and rocket science in his-or-her spare time, and it said something along the lines of: “THAT”S WHYY STEVN HAWKENS IS IN WHEEELCHAR!!!!!! BCAUSE HE DON”T BELIVE IN GOD!! JEBUS IS PUNSINGHING HIM!!!”Which got me thinking about why anyone would expect a guy who has suffered from ALS and been confined to a wheelchair for most of his life to believe in God? Among the many people who have just cause to question that a loving God is waiting in heaven to dish them out a heaping plate of Sky Cake, I’d think that Stephen Hawking would be one of them.It’s that kind of thinking that Hawking and Mlodinow take on here. Some people will point out the odds against any kind of life existing on Earth and say that God must have set it all in motion and made this place just for us and that it’s proof of an intelligent creator. Or you listen to a scientist like Hawking who points out that there’s whole multiverses where life doesn’t exist and that the only reason we know how lucky we are is that we exist to appreciate how lucky we are. Basing the idea that there must be some kind of intelligent creator simply because we’re here is bad science.And that’s Hawking’s point. This isn’t an anti-God book, it’s a pro-science and pro-critical thinking book. Hawking does a nice job in the early chapters of giving a brief overview of the development of the scientific method and how beliefs in mysterious beings have been incorporated into theories and then debunked over the centuries. Then he lays out the flaws in the models that insist that there has to be some kind of creator being in the mix. Even though Hawking does his best to dumb down the quantum physics that he claims proves his point and provides lots of handy pictures and graphics to help out the math and science challenged like me, it’s not exactly light reading. It’s short at 181 pages, and that helps, but while I’m fascinated by this kind of stuff, I’m also stupid enough that I had to read over some sections a couple of times before I thought I had a handle on it.It’s enlightening and a nice overview of both the scientific method and quantum physics, but unfortunately, I can’t see any of the people who should read this actually picking it up.

The book examines the history of scientific knowledge about the universe and explains 11 dimension M-theory. The authors of the book point out that a Unified Field Theory (a theory, based on an early model of the universe, proposed by Albert Einstein and other physicists) may not exist.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهارم ماه مارس سال 2012 میلادیسه برگردان فارسی از این کتاب وجود دارد: «علی هادیان و سارا ایزدیار نشر مازیار»؛ «حسین صداقت و امیر امیرآبادی نشر نقش و نگار»؛ «جمیل بصام انتشارات افکار»؛ ا. شاستیون هاوکینگ می‌گویند: ممکن است روشی که کیهان بوجود آمده، هماهنگ با قوانین دانش باشد، که در این صورت نیازی نیست به خدا متوسل بشویم، تا تصمیم بگیریم، که کیهان چگونه آغاز شده‌ است. اگر ما یک فرضیه همه‌ جانبه و کامل را، در مورد پیدایش عالم کشف کنیم، این مهمترین پیروزی انسان خواهد بود، چون ما قادر خواهیم بود، که فکر خدا را بخوانیم...؛ بشر، راز خلقت جهان را گشوده‌ است. جهان می‌تواند بطور خود بخود (خود با خود)، خودش را از هیچ بوجود آورَد، بعلاوه می‌تواند در حالت‌های متفاوت ایجاد شده باشد، و همه ی مشاهدات، و محاسبات بر این نظر صحه می‌گذارند. در سال 1999 میلادی، استیون هاوکینگ، در یک سخنرانی، پس از اشاره به زمان‌های دور، که بشر نخستین برای رویارویی با بیماریهای کشنده، و حوادث طبیعی (سیل و زلزله)، دست به دامان خدایان می‌شد ــ به معنی معکوس به نقش خداوند اشاره نمود و گفتThe future of the universe is not completely determined by the laws of science, and its present state, as Laplace thought.

Stephen Hawking is smarter than I am. That's no big feat because two of my cats are smarter than I am. The other cat is a certifiable idiot. But Hawking is way smarter than I am. The Grand Design is Hawking's explanation, more or less, about why the universe is the way it is. The answer comes down to M-theory which is more of a combining of explanations than one single unifying theory. Many reviewers seem to think Hawking is saying there is no God but he really seems to be stating that God is irrelevant. The real question is did we come from something or nothing. The beginning of an answer involves an understanding of quantum physics and multiverses that Hawking put as well into laymen's term as we can hope for. I don't pretend to understand everything in this book. I'm still contemplating why the world needs hairballs. But I did immensely enjoy reading this short book and can honestly say I understand a little bit more."

38,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"I have a feeling that the publishing industry is milking Stephen Hawking. There was a time when we had a dashing physicist named Richard Feynman who used LSD and played banjo in a strip club. The naked pole dancers didn’t distract him from formulating quantum electrodynamics. He was quite a genius, and he was all over the place with his talks and popular books. But he’s dead. Now Stephen Hawking seems to be the coolest physicist around. He’s paralyzed and wheelchair-bound, and he speaks through a voice synthesizer by twitching a tiny working cheek muscle against a screen to pick up a displayed word. How cool is that! So he’s become quite a celebrity, and he fully deserves it. The public is fascinated with him. But that doesn’t mean a whole lot for the quality of his books. I’ve read better pop-physics books than this one. Besides, I didn’t see anything new here. This book got more publicity because it’s supposed to take on the question of God. It’s no secret that the great biologists and physicists tend to be atheists. That’s a very telling fact. But having acknowledged that, I don’t see a point in a physicist trying to “disprove” God through physics. Upon being asked by Napoleon where God fits in his physics, Laplace is reported to having said: “Sire, I have not needed that hypothesis.” Science, by definition, does not and cannot use the God hypothesis. I don’t see why it should get into the business of rejecting that hypothesis. Those who are inclined to reject God can point to the findings of biology and cosmology for support. But that is quite different from a physicist setting out to refute God based on physics. As for the God-rejecting physics – it can be summarized in two points: 1) While no individual physical object can appear out of nothing, an entire universe can. This is because the sum-total of the energy in the universe is zero. 2) There are almost an infinite number of universes popping out of nothing into existence. One of them, like the one where we live, can, by mere chance, have the right properties (laws and constants of physics) for the emergence of starts and planets and eventually life. The book goes into explaining the physics behind these two claims. Unless you’re a physicist as good as Hawking, there’s nothing you can say about his physics. "
39,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5973308-david-boyce,2,"As a cosmologist and a Stephen Hawking fan, I have a real issue with this book. His statement, that the Universe unpacks itself and therefore does not need a creator is based on some really flawed logic called 'model dependent realism'. MDR is a way of comparing reality to a model, if the model produces the same observable characteristics as observed in reality then the model is said to be as true as any other model.Imagine this, if there was equal amounts of incriminating evidence that two people committed a crime and prosecution lawyers could build a case against both men then under MDR both are guilty of the crime irrespective of the fact that it only happened one way. By invoking MDR Hawking is blatantly ignoring the lessons of the past, that evidence makes or breaks models, and so far M-theory is unsupported by evidence.In fact if you follow the line of Hawking's logic, rather than his conclusion, you can even say that Hawking categorically proves the existence of God - All be it as an MDR model of Universe creation. However he selectively ignores this and only looks at how MDR supports his religious beliefs. But, there are a lot of things wrong with this book. Let me explain....Hawking contradicts himself. He says that Kepler, Galileo, Descartes and Newton saw that the laws of physics were the work of God and that this God was not the God the Old Testament. However we do not have enough written down about the religious beliefs off all of the above to know that this is true and this statement is certainly not true for Newton who was as Christian as you could get. Hawking is doing something quite unscientific here, he is trying to re-write history. It is an embarrassment to atheism that some of the greatest geniuses off all time could have a religious belief like the rest of us and so Hawking is trying to apologise for this by making out that somehow the religious beliefs of these scientists were different to that of the rest of the population.Hawking suggests at some points that we must take the Universe at face value, that we must consider real only what is measurably real and then contradicts himself (when talking about the holographic theory) by saying that the Universe may be fundamentally different to how we observe it.Hawking suggests that God doesn’t intervene, and defines intervening as a suspension of the normal laws of physics. But what about intervention using the laws of physics. What about a God that intervenes only rarely. Under MDR all are as real as a God that never intervenes. Hawking laughs at the idea that we might all be the figment of someone else’s dream, but under the logic he himself invokes, this theory is as real as M-theory.Hawking describes how our perception of reality can be changed by placing upside down glasses on our faces. Our minds are so set in their ways that they refuse the new reality and change the input to fit with the model of the reality in our heads. In MDR the model each person has in their heads is a real reality. Reality is unique to each observer. If God exists in my model, it is true for my Universe, if he doesn’t in yours then God really is absent from yours.Hawking describes how St Augustine concluded that the Earth was young due to the ages of people in the bible, but at the time there was no recognised evidence to suggest otherwise. According to MDR young Earth creationism was the reality, since no other model existed. He says that young Earth creationism in the present day is as real as the big bang theory. But Hawking is breaking his own logic here. In today’s day and age we have a lot more evidence that the Universe began with something like the big bang which means that under MDR, this model is considered to be MORE real.Hawking describes how Hubble’s model of the Universe was accepted because it was the most natural model but naturalness and elegance is purely subjective. In MDR plausibility is not measured. Hawking mentions how the laws of nature determine a range of probabilities of various futures and past, and yet avoids the issue about how a selection is made. Somehow a selection IS made.Hawking describes how the Universe is comprehensible because it can be modelled. This is not true. Only the model is comprehensible. The Universe is not the model; the Universe is infinite and by its very nature incomprehensible and thanks to quantum physics not even entirely measurable.The bits that really make me cringe, and I have a degree and a PhD in this, is where Hawking gets his science wrong. Hawking suggests that the standard model “agrees with all current evidence”, but this is not true. Experiments have observed that the neutrino has mass, and the standard model cannot account for this.Hawking suggests that inflation in the early Universe really did happen, but recent observations by his old friend Roger Penrose have cast serious doubts over this. Hawking also suggests that this Universe is casually disconnected from the other possibilities, and so what we experience is just one possibility. However M-theory suggests that gravity information leaks between membranes, thus collapsing the universe into one possibility. This one.Hawking suggests the Universe has 4 dimensions of space time as the result of our selection. In his words the Universe is like this because this is one of the possibilities it could have been and our selection is this. But as Einstein said, “God doesn’t play dice”. To suggest that some thing’s have no fundamental reason for existing is like saying “Everybody stop all scientific research, because there is no fundamental reason for any of this”.Hawking also suggests that the act of creation is understandable purely within the realm of science, but doesn’t mention that we have no science that works at t=0. The science goof that nearly had me eating my kindle in apoplexy was when Hawking suggests that black holes have positive gravitational potential energy. If that were true, the milky way would be spread around the Universe. Hawking does do well at talking his way out of the fine tuning argument. He effectively kills that argument dead and I agree we do not need God to explain why the Universe is perfect for our existence. But my reply is that, people shouldn’t have been using that line of apologism in the first place because it doesn’t make theological sense, let alone scientific sense. According to Christian doctrine God made creation for himself, he did not make it for us.Hawking does well at explaining how quantum mechanics and relativity on intermediate scales produce Newtonian like physics. This is the Hawking we know and love and this book should have been full of this kind of stuff. Instead it is full of laughable pseudoscience and theology. Model dependent realism is not robust enough for Hawking’s confidence in it and doesn’t hold up to scrutiny or close inspection.The theological work in this is very much of the style of Dawkins and others who successfully disprove Gods of their own imagining. They create a God, give it powers and then disprove the God that they have created. But they don’t get anywhere near the God that people worship in churches. Hawking’s intellect outstrips his own imagination and it really shows in this work. I am very happily the other way around."

 The nihilists have been right all along...M-theory: Doubts linger over godless multiverseSTEPHEN HAWKING'S new book The Grand Design sparked a furore over whether physics can be used to disprove the existence of God. But few have noted that the idea at the core of the book, M-theory, is the subject of an ongoing scientific debate – specifically over the very aspect of the theory that might scrap the need for a divine creator.That the laws of nature in our universe are finely tuned for life seems miraculous, leading some to invoke divine involvement. But if there is a multiverse out there – a multitude of universes, each with its own laws of physics – then the conditions we observe may not be unique.Source"

On the flip side, I had several light bulb moments, which is always nice.Among other things, Hawking makes a few great points particularly about the essence of ""reality.""And this passage below, which touches on free will, intrigued me.How can one tell if a being has free will? If one encounters an alien, how can one tell if it is just a robot or it has a mind of its own? The behavior of a robot would be completely determined, unlike that of a being with free will. Thus one could in principle detect a robot as a being whose actions can be predicted. As we said in Chapter 2, this may be impossibly difficult if the being is large and complex. We cannot even solve exactly the equations for three or more particles interacting with each other. Since an alien the size of a human would contain about a thousand trillion trillion particles even if the alien were a robot, it would be impossible to solve the equations and predict what it would do. We would therefore have to say that any complex being has free will--not as a fundamental feature, but as an effective theory, an admission of our inability to do the calculation that would enable us to predict its actions.So basically free will is an illusion, but given our inability to tease out all the complex biological processes that contribute to behavior, it is a good working theory for practical purposes. Thought this was an interesting way of looking at it.Worthy book, well written, and as good an attempt as any to simplify some very complex topics."

There were a couple of sections that I re-read, in an attempt to make concrete some of the more abstract aspects of m-theory. Despite my rudimentary understanding of quantum physics, I still gleaned a great deal from this book and would recommend it to anyone who is even mildly curious. Those who have a more advanced education in physics may find this book too basic, especially the earlier chapters.Questions such as ""What occurred before the big bang?"" and ""what instigated the creation of the universe?"" are addressed in the last chapter, and the earlier chapters build up a nice base of prior research for those unfamiliar with m-theory.

As is the case with most such gifts, I began to read it immediately.I was almost immediately turned off by the text owing to an extraordinary display of ignorance on the part of the authors and the editors, a mistake appearing in the first few pages in their lead-up to what is supposed to be a survey of the history of physics as germinated in Ionian philosophy. Here they note in passing that writing was first employed around 7000 BCE. In fact, so far as we've evidence, writing first appeared about 6000 years ago, in Sumer in approximately 4000 BCE.To make matters worse the authors go on glibly to dismiss philosophy as defunct--not too surprising as their review of it doesn't display much familiarity with the discipline.Beyond this, I found the jokes peppering this slim volume condescending yet sophomoric, unfunny and far too frequent.As regards the physics, I'm hardly qualified the judge, lacking as I do the background in mathematics and research physics to evaluate their positions. However, as someone with some background in philosophy and in the history of science, I find nothing original in their M theory business, such contextualization being rather old hat.There are many fine books written for generalists which attempt to explain modern cosmology and microphysics.

Are you worried you won't understand science because it's dense and dry and has diagrams instead of pictures? This is the book for you, then -- short, succinct, full-colour, and most importantly: clearly explained. The concepts here are intense and heady, but Hawking (and Mlodinow) write about them in a way you can actually understand. The mathematics are lacking, so this is definitely pop-science (and when I tried to explain an experiment referenced to a friend, I realized I wasn't completely sure when or who had conducted it, so..a bibliography would have been nice?). It's like a cosmology buffet: chronologically organized, mostly, from mythology to M-theory, with a sampling of the ideas therein. You'll need to delve further for a real meaty meal, but as appetizers: this shit is high-class.

47,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9512361-andrew-langridge,1,"There are only a couple of positives that I can think to say about this book. Firstly, Hawking has some Feynman-like qualities in being able to lucidly express important ideas in physics such as time dilation in special relativity and the double slit experiment. Secondly, his philosophy of science that he calls model-based realism has many things going for it, although why it is called realism is never fully explained. I did not find this book particularly easy to read, probably because I did not believe from the outset that I was going to be enlightened about our origins.Hawking states ""Philosophy is dead"", but scientists should be especially circumspect when trying to extrapolate their ideas into the humanities. Contemporary readers are still able to detect an elusive thread of truth running through all great philosophical works, and that, like the great works of art, they certainly have not been superseded by developments in science. Scientists meddling in the humanities often give the impression of never having studied the subjects they are criticising and tend to make 'straw man' arguments. The question 'why are we here?' is supposedly solved by science, but is of much more profound significance than Hawking credits. We feel our lives to have value as well as function and our desire throughout history to find life meaningful cannot be dismissed as lacking any significance. 'Is there a creator?' I have no particular axe to grind in favour of religion, but Hawking hypocritically rehashes ancient philosophical arguments for the non-existence of God, such as ""who created God?"". Moreover, religions cannot be treated simply as ontologies devoid of all the mythical elements that have inspired some of the greatest products of art and civilisation. Indeed, Weber tells us that science itself was given impetus by Protestantism.Hawking spends a long time discussing 'anthropic' arguments, but I don't understand their significance. It is only strange that the universe has these particular values for the universal constants or that the Earth's orbit has this narrow range of orbital parameters leading to the evolution of humanity if you have some reference point outside the universe to assess it from. We are doing science from the perspective of the human race as we are here and now, so of course the universe appears to us to be evolved to suit us, otherwise we would not be here to do the science. Hawking advances M Theory as the key to explaining the universe. I am not sufficiently qualified to give an opinion on this, but one thing it seems possible to say is that 'multiverse' theories are unique in science not only for never having been tested but also for being impossible to test. A far-fetched theory for why the dinosaurs died out at least has the possibility of being tested against palaeontological evidence. Any notions we entertain to make the concept of causality apply beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause. I agree with Pliny (ancient wisdom that Hawking dismisses) who states the impossibility of measuring the universe or understanding how it arose. To me, 'universe' by definition means everything that exists, so how can there be any reference point outside it from which to measure it? Cosmological physics turns out paradoxes by the dozen. If the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into? What caused the big bang? If we need mathematics to explain this, what makes us so sure we can rely on mathematics? And what about reasoning itself? What is truth? Oh darn it - another philosophical question!"
48,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1777325-julia,3,"I own several of Hawking's books, and so I was drawn to this thin volume. Obviously his co-author did most of the work, since Hawking's health continues to deteriorate. Mlodinow is a physicist at Caltech and an author in his own right. His name should appear as co-author, but my cynical brain thinks the publisher felt Hawking's name would sell more copies.Much time is given to Richard Feynman and his work in quantum physics. In fact, this book promotes the study of quantum theory as the main answer to human questions about existence. The book does a decent job of tracing the historical ways in which humans tried to comprehend the universe, but it does so in an egotistical way that bothers me. The very first page says ""philosophy is dead"" and advocates science as the only TRUE way to approach the deep human questions about the universe and our place in it.While I do hold science as the basis of my belief system, I'm just a bit concerned that Hawking put his name to a book that occasionally ""sniggers"" at the ides of earlier thinkers. Just because Ptolomy's design of the universe has been proven wrong should not denigrate the desire of his mind to understand the universe.So while I found some of the ideas interesting, WHOEVER really wrote this book comes across as rather egotistical. The sections on quantum theory are very complex, and I had to skip over some of the more esoteric parts.I've always found Hawking's books to be centered on his fascination with understanding this universe. In none of them did I ever find the condescention that is part of this book, and that's a danger for a scientist. Humility should be as important to a scientist as to a philosopher--Socrates knew that when he said he realized the Oracle of Delphi had claimed he was the wisest man in the world. He realized he WAS the wisest man only when he came to his famous conclusion that he ""knew nothing"". This book needed that humility lesson."

51,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35532567-alex,5,"He can get quite technical at times but overall a cogent read. In the end, he jumped a little for me. For example, here he tries to refute that a creator is required:""If the total energy of the universe must always remain zero, and it costs energy to create a body, how can a whole universe be created from nothing? That is why there must be a law like gravity. Because gravity is attractive, gravitational energy is negative: one has to do work to separate a gravitationally bound system... black holes have positive energy [and they balance out the negative energy]. That's why empty space is stable. [that is, a body cannot appear in empty space.] Bodies such as stars or black holes cannot just appear out of nothing. But a whole universe can.Because gravity shapes space and time, it allows space-time to be locally stable but globally unstable. On the scale of the entire universe, the positive energy of the matter can be balanced by the negative gravitational enerby, and so there is no restriction on the creation of whole universes."" (p.180) Nevertheless, it's difficult to find a book of this length that does a better job at explaining some pretty mind-blowing concepts."
52,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"Ever since I was little, I remember the image of Stephen Hawking from TV. I don't know why, but he remained embroidered in my brain after watching a TV show that spoke of him. This must have been 10 years ago, or something like that, but when it was explained to me what he was and what he was doing and did and why he looked the way he looked (remember I was 7 or 8 so I was bound to ask hurtful questions), I became to develop this fondness towards him. In my late years (oh, I'm soooo old), when I was 15 or something like that I started searching information about his work. Now, we have to be clear on one point. I do not, never did and probably (though hopefully not) never will understand physics. It has always been beyond my grasp and I sucked ass at it both at school and at home. Physics for me has to be explained in words and verbal theories. When you lay formulas on a paper, you lost me. And I mean really lost me. This bad understanding of mine is somewhat minimized by the fact that once I understood and learned something, I will never forget it. My memory is really good, and I'm proud to say I've learned a bit of physics both in school and outside of it, just by having it explained over and over again by patient friends that took their time with me. Now, when it comes to anything more complex than normal, simple, high school physics, you lost me again. Quantum physics is something that is absolutely and completely beyond my grasp. Still, in this little book of his, Stephen Hawking managed to explain some things to me, not just me but all of us who read the book. And after finishing it, I felt like I kinda/sorta understood them. Now I know that Stephen Hawking himself isn't able to ""write"" a book. But I've been doing my research and I found out some amazing things about him. The way he pours his thoughts on a paper is by help of his assistant, who sits next to him and asks him simple questions like ""what word are you searching for?"". Then he goes on to trials ""reassuring? reassured? reassure?"". Whenever Hawking agrees to a word, he slightly blinks. Whenever he doesn't, he grins. This is painstaking work. It's horribly slow and you have to be incredibly patient in order to do that. It's monumental work, really, and it deserves respect. Another thing I found out about Stephen Hawking that really impressed me was the fact that when he realized he wouldn't be able to write on a paper and make written calculations of his theories, he developed, inside his mind, a way of ""looking at the universe"". Put simply, there's 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D. We people see 3D. Hawking has developed a means through which he sees, or better imagines in 4D, the dimension that includes time. Isn't that awesome?! I've barely learned to read and write in my whole life! Anyways. I feel like I turned this review into an essay about how great Hawking is. Oh well. Read the book. Read his other books. You'll understand more when you finish them. "

The book gives a good answer to the so-called ""anthropic principle""--namely, that the laws of physics and the fundamental constants appear to be perfectly tuned to allow our world, life, and humans to develop. If any of the laws or fundamental constants were to deviate even slightly, life might not be even possible.The answer to this dilemma, the authors state, is not that God created the laws of physics, and the answer is not that, by some fantastic coincidence, the laws of physics just happen to be perfect. Instead, an infinite number of universes have been created, each with its own unique set of laws. The book is interesting, but seems to fall down in the last chapter, titled, The Grand Design. In the last chapter, the authors argue that M-Theory is the only candidate theory that explains the universe--but that it has not yet been verified by observation. In fact, the authors state that M-Theory has not yet been fully developed; only some characteristics of the theory have been described. The wide, sweeping statements and conclusions made in the last chapter just don't seem to satisfy me."

These fields help us understand the universe, that crazy thing that’s all around us, and the fact that we have come so far is simply amazing. In The Grand Design, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow reflect upon how physics achieves this understanding of the universe, with a particular emphasis on how physics can explain the origin of the universe in a way that removes the need for a deity (whom we’ll call God).Mlodinow gets his name on the cover, but this is clearly a Hawking book first and foremost. His name is bigger, and the inside of the dust jacket begins, “The first major work in nearly a decade by one of the world’s great thinkers…"" (emphasis mine). Sorry, Mlodinow! You’re a nice guy, but I guess you’re just not a “great thinker”. (Actually, although I think I’d heard of him before, this is the first time I have encountered one of his “his” books, and now I can go and mark down a bunch of his other books to read. But I should probably talk about this book now.)I shall hereafter refer to Hawking and Mlodinow as “H&M” because it tickles my fancy to fantasize that a clothing chain might write a book on physics.The Grand Design is certainly an engaging treatise, but it is also problematic. I had a lot of fun reading it, and although I have a lot of experience reading about science, I feel confident recommending it for people who might otherwise quirk an eyebrow and say, “Erm … science? I don’t know….” It’s a very short book; it’s extremely conversational in tone, with plenty of analogies; and there are no tests at the end. There are even pictures (albeit not very good ones)! By problematic I mean that, from my own reading and from what I have read of reviews here on Goodreads, H&M confront the role of physics vis-à-vis religion in a way that doesn’t lend itself to clarity and suasion. There seems to be a disconnect between the evidence they present (which is very good) and how they phrase or otherwise communicate the conclusions they draw. This results in an ambiguity that means people will often misinterpret those conclusions or dismiss them out of hand. The Grand Design, one might say, suffers from a grand design flaw.(I am so sorry for that last sentence.)I can give an example from the very first page of the book, which, by the way, begins not with a foreword, preface, or introduction, but Chapter 1. It’s true that this first chapter is very much an introductory chapter that lays the ground for the rest of the book, but I have to give H&M and their editors credit for not subjecting us to another scientist pontificating about these guys or a token preface. The conciseness of this book is appreciated, even if it leads to pithy statements like this:Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.As someone who unequivocally supports science as a way to discover and understand the universe, I must nevertheless shake my head at this passage. Taken literally, it seems like an unnecessarily harsh indictment of philosophy, particularly contemporary philosophy, which is very much alive. Even leaving aside philosophy that concerns itself with things other than those questions (such as “Who are we? Where did we come from?”), philosophers routinely discuss developments in science in their philosophy. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that most scientists also become philosophers—as you will see if you read this book, it is clear that H&M are. However, to be fair to them, I think that what H&M are trying to distinguish—albeit sensationally—is the difference between purely attempting to reason about our existence and our origins (rationalism) and using tools to collect data and make inferences about that existence and those origins (empiricism). The program founded in the Western world by Aristotle and raised onto a pedestal by the Enlightenment scientists has failed: we cannot know the world through reason alone. Bacon, Newton, Galileo, Franklin, etc., realized that we must experiment—we have to conduct tests that anyone with the appropriate knowledge and equipment can reproduce. So philosophy alone cannot take us the entire way, and science provides that next crucial step.If you haven’t read the book, and especially if you approach physics with more wariness than I do, you will find this very weird, but I found the first half of the book much heavier than the last half (with one notable exception). Following that incendiary introductory passage, H&M segue into a deep discussion of what science is, where it is coming from, and where it might be going. Specifically, they introduce a concept called model-dependent realism. And I think this is a fascinating, perhaps even peculiar decision on their part, because I doubt many of their readers would have ever heard of this term—whereas, in comparison, even most laypeople will have heard words like “quantum mechanics” and “general relativity”. H&M have great confidence in their audience, for they have faith that the audience will not be deterred when they drop some philosophy of science in the first chapter.It makes sense to talk about model-dependent realism, though, because it is relevant to M-theory, which is the group of theories that H&M discuss as a candidate for the ultimate “theory of everything”. And kudos to H&M for trying to pull back the curtain on the somewhat mystical way “theories” are constructed and viewed (at least by some scientists). In particular, I love the analogy they use with a map of the world: we can’t accurately transfer a three-dimensional sphere to a two-dimensional surface, so no matter what projection we use (e.g., Mercator, Robinson), it will always be distorted. So just as different projections provide different but useful models of our world, different theories provide different but useful models of the universe. Some of these theories have been collected under the name “M-theory”, and together they might be “the answer” when none of them alone could make the cut.Of course, I like model-dependent realism, because I am a realist, and as H&M say, it “short-circuits all this argument and discussion between the realist and anti-realist schools of thought”. I won’t go into realism versus anti-realism here; that is probably best left for a deeper discussion of the philosophy of science. Suffice it to say, science is not about establishing a single, fixed “truth” outlined by a single set of theories. As H&M point out, Ptolemy and Kepler’s model of a geocentric orbit using epicycles is as valid as our heliocentric model—one certainly can regard the rest of the solar system as “orbiting” the Earth. Yet the geocentric model is fiendishly complex and quickly becomes unwieldy if one ever wants to perform actual calculations; the heliocentric model has the advantage of being simpler and more elegant. So these are all thoughts that H&M want us to consider as they launch into an overview of the state of physics in the twenty-first century.I like that H&M go to the trouble of distinguishing between “probability” as we use the term colloquially and the role probability plays in quantum mechanics. Nancy Kress discusses probability in quantum mechanics at length in 
Probability Sun
, but she only alludes to the difference rather than explicates it. Quantum mechanics is weird and strange and revolutionary precisely because of one word: uncertainty. It blew away the classical world, particularly the deterministic aspect. That pesky Heisenberg uncertainty principle means we’ll never know exactly where a particle is and how fast it is moving. Hence, according to quantum mechanics, asking where a particle is is a meaningless question. Rather, ask what the probability is of a particle being in a particular point in space-time. There is a probability that all the particles in my left arm might actually be in Switzerland right now, but the probability is tiny compared to the probability that they are, in fact, attached to my left shoulder! (And for this I am thankful.)Similarly, The Grand Design finally clarified for me what a boson is. I just have these song lyrics stuck in my head:They suppose that particles have mass becauseThere is this Higgs field that extends through all spaceAnd some particles slow down while other particles raceStraight through like the photon — it has no massBut something heavy like the top quark, it’s draggin’ its ***And the Higgs is a boson that carries a forceAnd makes particles take orders from the field that is its source.If you haven’t already seen it, the Large Hadron Rap is one of the most amazing science raps I have ever seen, and it does an excellent job at explaining what scientists are trying to achieve using the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, I still wasn’t clear on this idea of bosons and force fields. Something about the way H&M explain bosons in The Grand Design finally made it click for me:… according to classical theories, forces are transmitted by fields. But in quantum ield theories the force fields are pictured as being made of various elementary particles called bosons, which are force-carrying particles that fly back and forth between matter particles, transmitting the forces.So the field and particle are dual concepts, one of which applies to classical theories (like relativity) while the other applies to quantum theory. Particles are the language of quantum mechanics, and so force fields have been replaced by a particle that conveys each force: photons for electromagnetism, gluons for the strong force, W and Z bosons for the weak force, and perhaps gravitons for gravity (we haven’t found them yet!). That’s really cool, and I am glad H&M cleared that up for me. This is why I read so many books that cover the same scientific concepts, even similar books by one author: each different method of explaining a concept aids my understanding in some small way.This kind of incremental learning is present in science as well. H&M mention, “Modern technology is sensitive enough to allow us to perform many sensitive tests of general relativity, and it has passed every one”. That relativity is testable and falsifiable—and, correspondingly, has passed all of the tests we have thus far devised—lends great credence to its accuracy as a scientific model. There are, of course, more subtle questions about the roles of testability and falsification play in judging a scientific theory (e.g.: Evolution is arguably not testable, nor is string theory.) What’s important is that H&M emphasize that science is not some kind of mysterious black box where we plug in data in order to obtain inviolable laws of nature. So that’s why I’m fine with people criticizing, say, evolution, because all science should be open to criticism—but the moment that criticism rests on an objection like “it’s only a ‘theory’!” I will stop listening. Our scientific principles are theories because science is self-correcting and constantly improving upon and revising those principles. That is why science is so powerful, so important, and so very cool.By far the most mind-boggling concept in The Grand Design comes at the end, and it is the exception to my earlier remark that I find the first part of the book the heaviest in terms of mental exertion. The ultimate thesis of this book is that we can explain the origin of the universe without invoking a creator deity, a God. I think it is very important to note that H&M are not saying that science can disprove the existence of God, nor is that an objective of The Grand Design. While it is clear that H&M, like myself, do not believe a God exists, this is not their argument. Instead, they are merely removing the necessity of God’s existence. I can see how one can misinterpret the book—hence my initial comments about the disconnect and design flaw. H&M’s scepticism is vividly demonstrated, and they raise some of the problems with attempting to fit God into cosmogony—namely, if God created the universe, who created God? If the answer is that “God is eternal and has always been here,” then why can’t we just replace “God” with “the universe” and leave it at that?This might seem impossible, for we know the universe is not eternal in that sense: we can measure its age (with some degree of precision), and it’s only 13.7 billion years old! Moreover, we know that the universe will eventually reach some sort of end, whether it is heat death, a Big Crunch, etc. H&M resolve this, and that unfortunate singularity at the origin of the universe that prevents our physics from explaining anything, by saying:In the early universe—when the universe was small enough to be governed by both general relativity and quantum theory—there were effectively four dimensions of space and none of time. That means that when we speak of the “beginning” of the universe, we are skirting the subtle issue that as we look backward toward the very early universe, time as we know it does not exist! We must accept that our usual ideas of space and time do not apply to the very early universe.Read that twice: asking what happened “before” the universe existed is meaningless, because time itself did not exist as we regard it today. If that sounds too strange and too incredible to accept, believe me: you are certainly not alone. Much like my experience with bosons, I am only now, after confronting this several times, beginning to wrap my head around this explanation. We are just so obsessed with our view of linear time that thinking of a universe where time functions differently boggles our intuition. It is definitely the most difficult concept H&M present in this book, and as with some of their other explanations, I do not think they entirely succeed in presenting it the way they probably hoped.The Grand Design is ambitious. It is also brief and conversational, as physics books go, and at times this runs up against that ambition. As someone who loves the philosophy of science, loves physics, and has read quite a lot of books about physics, I enjoyed The Grand Design and found it enlightening. Although I recommend it to others with less experience, because it really is a very accessible book, I do so with one reservation: if this is your first physics book, don’t let it be your last. There are so many good ones out there, and while The Grand Design is a fine place to start, it is not the last word on the theory of everything.

It started out with some creation myths and a well-paced history of bigger picture science. It bogged down in the middle with an exploration of quantam physics that the author felt was necessary for his subsequent theory of Grand Design, but in reality did little for his theory or the book as a whole.In fact, while engaging, fun to read, and highly informative, the book falls flat at the end. The line of reasoning, from my perspective, leaves much to be desired. Consider a few quotes from the last chapter:""It is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, the the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. In this view it is accepted that some entity exists that needs no creator, and that entity is called God. We claim, however, that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings""While I find the philosophical question of who created God, highly intriguing, I think Mr. Hawking confuses the fact that we are constantly finding laws that govern existence, thereby explaining what we thought was only attributable to divine interference as proof that the divine does not exist. Take this next quote:""Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.""Really? Is it any less plausible that the universe just started randomly 13 billion years ago than a supreme being created it? Either line of thought requires a good amount of faith to believe in. It reminds me of C.S. Lewis' arguments for the existence of God and how they all fell short if you did not start from the premise of belief in something more than the random universe--ultimately you have to believe one way or the other and no amount of ""proof"" will stand up to scrutiny because there is simply too much we don't know.Regarding the Grand Design itself:""M-theory is the UNIFIED [caps mine] theory Einstein was hoping to find. The fact that we human beings-who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature-have been able to come this close to understanding of the laws governing us and our universe is a great triumph...If the theory is confirmed by observation, it will be the successful conclusion of a search going back more than 3000 years. We will have found the grand design.""This is from the last paragraph in the book. The problem is that there is nothing unified about M-theory. Hawking states this in his opening chapter and we learn later in the book that M-theory takes into account electromagnetism, strong forces, weak forces, and string theory in order to produce a multi-verse version of reality that includes 10 to the 500th power possibilities. Not only is this pretty far from fathomable to the average man, but it violates his first two principle of a good model from chapter 3, ""A model is a good model if it: 1. Is elegant 2. Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements"". A convoluted mish-mash of theories that produces so many various elements (mathematically computable or not) is hardly a ""good model"". Due to the sheer volume of calculations necessary it is hard to confirm fulfillment of the last two criteria that the good model: ""3. Agrees with and explains all existing observations 4. Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can disprove or falsify the model if they are not borne out.""Don't get me wrong. I am no quantam physicist nor cosmologist and certainly don't have the knowledge to disprove any theories in these fields. Likely we are on the right track with something like M-theory. However, it is not an easily understood unified theory (such may not even exist), and it certainly doesn't provide any answers about the why of the universe as it claims to. As with much of both science and religion, the more we learn and understand, the more questions arise.The poor finishing premises of this book and agonizingly thick explanations in the middle of this work, knock it down two notches, but it is still worth the read if this sort of thing interests you. Solid 3 stars."
59,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1917722-chy,4,"Since I read this here book, I’m going to attempt to talk like a smart person. It’s a half-hearted attempt and is doomed to failure, as hopefully you realize it already done did.“There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.”(Douglas Adams)This book totally agrees with that, in the end. I have this book because my sixteen-year-old stepson had to buy it for a class he was going to take, and then decided not to take the class. Perhaps that’s why I so strongly perceive it as written toward a “younger” audience. But, as with a lot of things written by very intelligent people toward an audience they knew to be dumber than they are, there are a lot of jokes that sort of insult your intelligence without really meaning to. You know, the kind of jokes that make teenagers really roll their eyes, which is especially bad when they’re in there to try to “relate to” the very people who roll their eyes at it.In talking about the Stoics describing “physical processes in legal terms and [believing] them to be in need of enforcement, even though the objects required to ‘obey’ the laws were inanimate”: “If you think it is hard to get humans to follow traffic laws, imagine convincing an asteroid to move along an ellipse.”It tends to be distracting and awkward and tacked-in-there. And it’s not needed; the book’s written in simple language, and it’s exceedingly easy to read, which makes it easy to be interested in it so long as one has at least a little interest in the subject anyway--which is not something these jokes would induce in any case. Still, it wasn’t enough to really degrade my opinion of the book.I did get a little frustrated with the over-simplification of things here and there, because so many times that kind of thing leaves out the explanations I come into this kind of thing looking for. And when I get all frustrated like that, I miss things, which was my main problem in college. The teachers tend to want to get to this point or that point and spit out some model along the way that I’d really like to dwell on, but their explanation is, “It exists because we need it for the equation all of us are on now so come on, come on.”I don’t even like to think about how long it took me to finally figure out where π came from and why we use it, and how frustrated I was with teachers who kept telling me, “Just feed your numbers into the formula and give the damn answer.”But I only hit that wall, really, there in the middle. The thing I found most useful about the book was the scientific history lessons. Reminders of when people like Newton and Aristotle lived, and just what they came up with---before we modified and reworded it. That was my favorite aspect of the book by far.My other favorite thing was the introduction to John Conway’s Game of Life. And I can’t believe I’ve never run across it before. How completely and utterly baffling, to me, that I never have. (Or maybe I have and it was just never presented in such a memorable way?) You can even download it and play with it as a “game”: http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/I’m not sure either of those links can show at all why I love the implications so much (because I haven’t actually read through those sites), but to explain I have to plagiarize pages of this book, so I’ll leave it be. And maybe call a buddy to see if he can download Life for me. Heh."
60,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,4,"It's a funny thing being a cosmologist in the greater Los Angeles area. Back when I was a partying single graduate student, I'd frequently hit the town for some fun. Inevitably I'd meet someone, strike up a conversation, and they might ask me what I did for a living.""Oh, I'm a cosmologist."" ""Cosmetologist? Cool, do you do make-up for movies?"" ""Um...not unless rouge is a component of dark matter."" (ba-da-bum)""...""""I make detectors and use them to study the origins and geometry of our universe."" ""Uh. No way. You ever work in movies?""I discovered after a few years of this that it was much easier and simpler to tell people I was Mary Poppins at Disneyland. Without exception, folks believed me, made a joke and moved on. The physics thing just cause wrinkled faces, and very odd non-sequiturs. Once I had a guy tell me all about a distant cousin who studied shrimp in the Netherlands. Frequently I'd get the physicist = physician mix-up. Luckily no one ever showed me their rash. Oh well, such is the life of the lonely, misunderstood cosmologist.Why am I telling you about all my misadventures in life? Oh yeah, to let you know that my background is observational cosmology. (I.e. making devices, detectors, instruments and doing experiments in labs, in Antarctica and on space-born projects.) I'm not a theorist, and most definitely not into string theory/membrane theory/M-theory. That stuff isn't even touched upon in most graduate programs. It's esoteric, wicked complicated, and honestly still in a very nascent stage.So, I'm not qualified to comment on M-theory being THE answer to The Grand Design as Hawking and Mlodinow so insistently propose. The question then becomes did they sell me on the idea. I dunno... maybe? It was all so very glossed over, overwhelmed by all the history and background needed to give the reader an appropriate framework. Then when they finally game to the climax of the story, where all the previous information should coalesce, M-theory barely got much of an explanation or treatment at all.I got the impression they wanted to push this Grand Idea, a wrap-up of all previous ideas, made with sweeping statements and generalizations to get press. Plus, if it turns out to work and be right, they can point to this very thin book and say ""A-ha!"" That's why I removed a star.Now, if you are looking to learn more about the science of the universe this is just the book for you. They do an excellent job explaining aspects of special relativity, general relativity, particle physics, early-universe physics, even my favorite field, the CMB. (Which maddeningly they call the CMBR, a very outdated term, and refer to the fluctuations as being in the microwave regime, even though they are sub-millimeter radiation! Grrr!) They even throw in a ton of historical context, which helps the reader understand the difficulties of the field and the constantly evolving nature of science.The science is great, you will learn a ton. Really. The writing is clear in that no-nonsense style Hawking is so famous for. Unfortunately in a few areas the explanations get really muddled to the point of incomprehensibility, and I suspect that might be Mlodinow's doing, since those muddled spots fall in his particular area of expertise. One would expect a research scientist in the field (even if she's a lowly experimentalist) should be able to breeze through all their scientific lessons. I found the string theory section to be really tough-going, with pretty poorly thought out examples. But it is a very esoteric field, and maybe there just aren't easy ways to help lay-folks visualize the 11-dimensional space and the vibrating membranes?Speaking of clear teaching examples, the book is filled with ways to help the reader visualize some very hard concepts. Gravity affects space-time like having a rubber sheet for your pool table, then pulling down on one spot right in the middle. The balls will curve around the area in much the same way that objects do near-ish black holes. The ""strings"" in string theory are described to be like a straw, with a surface space, but curled up on itself. However, from very far away a straw looks like a 2-dimensional line.And yet a few of their examples obviously fall short, which I suppose all stand-ins for the real thing will eventually do. The one that really stood out like a a sore thumb was the balloon-as-expanding-universe. Their illustration looks like someone could take a marker and draw little galaxies on a balloon. Then as the balloon is filled with more air and expands, all galaxies will move away from each other independently. The first trouble is that the galaxies, if drawn on, would expand themselves, which doesn't actually happen. (The mass and hence gravity of galaxies is a stronger force than the expansion of the universe.) In the text, it's made clear that the galaxies have to be treated as points on the balloon, but the graphic is a bit misleading. Secondly, the obvious question to the balloon is: Okay, the balloon expands into our 3-dimensional space, so what is the universe expanding into? They certainly touch on the answer later, but never refer back to our balloon. What a shame.At any rate, here's my advice: Believe their grand M-theory answer or don't, I don't think it matters as long as you have learned a few things about our scientific understanding of the universe along the way.Since I made fun of ""The Industry"" suitors I encountered around Los Angeles, I should relate a tale of the foolish physicists. Create a supersymmetry of courtship mishaps or something. I was at a party on campus, which was completely populated by science grad students, and maybe a few random stray people. I met a guy, he seemed nice enough, so we chatted about motorcycles for a while. He asked me what I studied, so I very jokingly told him I was a Theoretical Cosmetologist, and a student at the neighboring university (which has many, many more women). Ridiculous, right? The guy fell for it hook, line and sinker, and wanted to know more details of this theoretical cosmetology. So I told him all about color theory, combining it with an understanding of personality traits, and the effect of shadowing on first-impressions. Meanwhile, my co-workers stood behind him, trying to hold in their laughter. It was mean, but he believed me! If you ever meet me in person, only believe about 63% of what I say. The rest is a joke. And that's a scientifically proven fact."
61,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"When this book was released, I was reading a story about it on-line, and the headline said something like: “Stephen Hawking Says There Is No God”. Then I made the critical mistake of looking at the user comments under the story. It was the usual collection of badly spelled notes from ignorant asshats who tried to say that stupid science didn’t know nuthin’ or that it was all Obama’s fault. But one in particular caught my eye. It was by someone who undoubtedly dabbles in both neurosurgery and rocket science in his-or-her spare time, and it said something along the lines of: “THAT”S WHYY STEVN HAWKENS IS IN WHEEELCHAR!!!!!! BCAUSE HE DON”T BELIVE IN GOD!! JEBUS IS PUNSINGHING HIM!!!”Which got me thinking about why anyone would expect a guy who has suffered from ALS and been confined to a wheelchair for most of his life to believe in God? Among the many people who have just cause to question that a loving God is waiting in heaven to dish them out a heaping plate of Sky Cake, I’d think that Stephen Hawking would be one of them.It’s that kind of thinking that Hawking and Mlodinow take on here. Some people will point out the odds against any kind of life existing on Earth and say that God must have set it all in motion and made this place just for us and that it’s proof of an intelligent creator. Or you listen to a scientist like Hawking who points out that there’s whole multiverses where life doesn’t exist and that the only reason we know how lucky we are is that we exist to appreciate how lucky we are. Basing the idea that there must be some kind of intelligent creator simply because we’re here is bad science.And that’s Hawking’s point. This isn’t an anti-God book, it’s a pro-science and pro-critical thinking book. Hawking does a nice job in the early chapters of giving a brief overview of the development of the scientific method and how beliefs in mysterious beings have been incorporated into theories and then debunked over the centuries. Then he lays out the flaws in the models that insist that there has to be some kind of creator being in the mix. Even though Hawking does his best to dumb down the quantum physics that he claims proves his point and provides lots of handy pictures and graphics to help out the math and science challenged like me, it’s not exactly light reading. It’s short at 181 pages, and that helps, but while I’m fascinated by this kind of stuff, I’m also stupid enough that I had to read over some sections a couple of times before I thought I had a handle on it.It’s enlightening and a nice overview of both the scientific method and quantum physics, but unfortunately, I can’t see any of the people who should read this actually picking it up.

The book examines the history of scientific knowledge about the universe and explains 11 dimension M-theory. The authors of the book point out that a Unified Field Theory (a theory, based on an early model of the universe, proposed by Albert Einstein and other physicists) may not exist.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهارم ماه مارس سال 2012 میلادیسه برگردان فارسی از این کتاب وجود دارد: «علی هادیان و سارا ایزدیار نشر مازیار»؛ «حسین صداقت و امیر امیرآبادی نشر نقش و نگار»؛ «جمیل بصام انتشارات افکار»؛ ا. شاستیون هاوکینگ می‌گویند: ممکن است روشی که کیهان بوجود آمده، هماهنگ با قوانین دانش باشد، که در این صورت نیازی نیست به خدا متوسل بشویم، تا تصمیم بگیریم، که کیهان چگونه آغاز شده‌ است. اگر ما یک فرضیه همه‌ جانبه و کامل را، در مورد پیدایش عالم کشف کنیم، این مهمترین پیروزی انسان خواهد بود، چون ما قادر خواهیم بود، که فکر خدا را بخوانیم...؛ بشر، راز خلقت جهان را گشوده‌ است. جهان می‌تواند بطور خود بخود (خود با خود)، خودش را از هیچ بوجود آورَد، بعلاوه می‌تواند در حالت‌های متفاوت ایجاد شده باشد، و همه ی مشاهدات، و محاسبات بر این نظر صحه می‌گذارند. در سال 1999 میلادی، استیون هاوکینگ، در یک سخنرانی، پس از اشاره به زمان‌های دور، که بشر نخستین برای رویارویی با بیماریهای کشنده، و حوادث طبیعی (سیل و زلزله)، دست به دامان خدایان می‌شد ــ به معنی معکوس به نقش خداوند اشاره نمود و گفتThe future of the universe is not completely determined by the laws of science, and its present state, as Laplace thought.

Stephen Hawking is smarter than I am. That's no big feat because two of my cats are smarter than I am. The other cat is a certifiable idiot. But Hawking is way smarter than I am. The Grand Design is Hawking's explanation, more or less, about why the universe is the way it is. The answer comes down to M-theory which is more of a combining of explanations than one single unifying theory. Many reviewers seem to think Hawking is saying there is no God but he really seems to be stating that God is irrelevant. The real question is did we come from something or nothing. The beginning of an answer involves an understanding of quantum physics and multiverses that Hawking put as well into laymen's term as we can hope for. I don't pretend to understand everything in this book. I'm still contemplating why the world needs hairballs. But I did immensely enjoy reading this short book and can honestly say I understand a little bit more."

68,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"I have a feeling that the publishing industry is milking Stephen Hawking. There was a time when we had a dashing physicist named Richard Feynman who used LSD and played banjo in a strip club. The naked pole dancers didn’t distract him from formulating quantum electrodynamics. He was quite a genius, and he was all over the place with his talks and popular books. But he’s dead. Now Stephen Hawking seems to be the coolest physicist around. He’s paralyzed and wheelchair-bound, and he speaks through a voice synthesizer by twitching a tiny working cheek muscle against a screen to pick up a displayed word. How cool is that! So he’s become quite a celebrity, and he fully deserves it. The public is fascinated with him. But that doesn’t mean a whole lot for the quality of his books. I’ve read better pop-physics books than this one. Besides, I didn’t see anything new here. This book got more publicity because it’s supposed to take on the question of God. It’s no secret that the great biologists and physicists tend to be atheists. That’s a very telling fact. But having acknowledged that, I don’t see a point in a physicist trying to “disprove” God through physics. Upon being asked by Napoleon where God fits in his physics, Laplace is reported to having said: “Sire, I have not needed that hypothesis.” Science, by definition, does not and cannot use the God hypothesis. I don’t see why it should get into the business of rejecting that hypothesis. Those who are inclined to reject God can point to the findings of biology and cosmology for support. But that is quite different from a physicist setting out to refute God based on physics. As for the God-rejecting physics – it can be summarized in two points: 1) While no individual physical object can appear out of nothing, an entire universe can. This is because the sum-total of the energy in the universe is zero. 2) There are almost an infinite number of universes popping out of nothing into existence. One of them, like the one where we live, can, by mere chance, have the right properties (laws and constants of physics) for the emergence of starts and planets and eventually life. The book goes into explaining the physics behind these two claims. Unless you’re a physicist as good as Hawking, there’s nothing you can say about his physics. "
69,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5973308-david-boyce,2,"As a cosmologist and a Stephen Hawking fan, I have a real issue with this book. His statement, that the Universe unpacks itself and therefore does not need a creator is based on some really flawed logic called 'model dependent realism'. MDR is a way of comparing reality to a model, if the model produces the same observable characteristics as observed in reality then the model is said to be as true as any other model.Imagine this, if there was equal amounts of incriminating evidence that two people committed a crime and prosecution lawyers could build a case against both men then under MDR both are guilty of the crime irrespective of the fact that it only happened one way. By invoking MDR Hawking is blatantly ignoring the lessons of the past, that evidence makes or breaks models, and so far M-theory is unsupported by evidence.In fact if you follow the line of Hawking's logic, rather than his conclusion, you can even say that Hawking categorically proves the existence of God - All be it as an MDR model of Universe creation. However he selectively ignores this and only looks at how MDR supports his religious beliefs. But, there are a lot of things wrong with this book. Let me explain....Hawking contradicts himself. He says that Kepler, Galileo, Descartes and Newton saw that the laws of physics were the work of God and that this God was not the God the Old Testament. However we do not have enough written down about the religious beliefs off all of the above to know that this is true and this statement is certainly not true for Newton who was as Christian as you could get. Hawking is doing something quite unscientific here, he is trying to re-write history. It is an embarrassment to atheism that some of the greatest geniuses off all time could have a religious belief like the rest of us and so Hawking is trying to apologise for this by making out that somehow the religious beliefs of these scientists were different to that of the rest of the population.Hawking suggests at some points that we must take the Universe at face value, that we must consider real only what is measurably real and then contradicts himself (when talking about the holographic theory) by saying that the Universe may be fundamentally different to how we observe it.Hawking suggests that God doesn’t intervene, and defines intervening as a suspension of the normal laws of physics. But what about intervention using the laws of physics. What about a God that intervenes only rarely. Under MDR all are as real as a God that never intervenes. Hawking laughs at the idea that we might all be the figment of someone else’s dream, but under the logic he himself invokes, this theory is as real as M-theory.Hawking describes how our perception of reality can be changed by placing upside down glasses on our faces. Our minds are so set in their ways that they refuse the new reality and change the input to fit with the model of the reality in our heads. In MDR the model each person has in their heads is a real reality. Reality is unique to each observer. If God exists in my model, it is true for my Universe, if he doesn’t in yours then God really is absent from yours.Hawking describes how St Augustine concluded that the Earth was young due to the ages of people in the bible, but at the time there was no recognised evidence to suggest otherwise. According to MDR young Earth creationism was the reality, since no other model existed. He says that young Earth creationism in the present day is as real as the big bang theory. But Hawking is breaking his own logic here. In today’s day and age we have a lot more evidence that the Universe began with something like the big bang which means that under MDR, this model is considered to be MORE real.Hawking describes how Hubble’s model of the Universe was accepted because it was the most natural model but naturalness and elegance is purely subjective. In MDR plausibility is not measured. Hawking mentions how the laws of nature determine a range of probabilities of various futures and past, and yet avoids the issue about how a selection is made. Somehow a selection IS made.Hawking describes how the Universe is comprehensible because it can be modelled. This is not true. Only the model is comprehensible. The Universe is not the model; the Universe is infinite and by its very nature incomprehensible and thanks to quantum physics not even entirely measurable.The bits that really make me cringe, and I have a degree and a PhD in this, is where Hawking gets his science wrong. Hawking suggests that the standard model “agrees with all current evidence”, but this is not true. Experiments have observed that the neutrino has mass, and the standard model cannot account for this.Hawking suggests that inflation in the early Universe really did happen, but recent observations by his old friend Roger Penrose have cast serious doubts over this. Hawking also suggests that this Universe is casually disconnected from the other possibilities, and so what we experience is just one possibility. However M-theory suggests that gravity information leaks between membranes, thus collapsing the universe into one possibility. This one.Hawking suggests the Universe has 4 dimensions of space time as the result of our selection. In his words the Universe is like this because this is one of the possibilities it could have been and our selection is this. But as Einstein said, “God doesn’t play dice”. To suggest that some thing’s have no fundamental reason for existing is like saying “Everybody stop all scientific research, because there is no fundamental reason for any of this”.Hawking also suggests that the act of creation is understandable purely within the realm of science, but doesn’t mention that we have no science that works at t=0. The science goof that nearly had me eating my kindle in apoplexy was when Hawking suggests that black holes have positive gravitational potential energy. If that were true, the milky way would be spread around the Universe. Hawking does do well at talking his way out of the fine tuning argument. He effectively kills that argument dead and I agree we do not need God to explain why the Universe is perfect for our existence. But my reply is that, people shouldn’t have been using that line of apologism in the first place because it doesn’t make theological sense, let alone scientific sense. According to Christian doctrine God made creation for himself, he did not make it for us.Hawking does well at explaining how quantum mechanics and relativity on intermediate scales produce Newtonian like physics. This is the Hawking we know and love and this book should have been full of this kind of stuff. Instead it is full of laughable pseudoscience and theology. Model dependent realism is not robust enough for Hawking’s confidence in it and doesn’t hold up to scrutiny or close inspection.The theological work in this is very much of the style of Dawkins and others who successfully disprove Gods of their own imagining. They create a God, give it powers and then disprove the God that they have created. But they don’t get anywhere near the God that people worship in churches. Hawking’s intellect outstrips his own imagination and it really shows in this work. I am very happily the other way around."

01.11.2016: Stephen Hawking warns that the Higgs Boson field could collapse, resulting in a chain reaction that would take in the whole universe with it.
 The nihilists have been right all along...M-theory: Doubts linger over godless multiverseSTEPHEN HAWKING'S new book The Grand Design sparked a furore over whether physics can be used to disprove the existence of God. But few have noted that the idea at the core of the book, M-theory, is the subject of an ongoing scientific debate – specifically over the very aspect of the theory that might scrap the need for a divine creator.That the laws of nature in our universe are finely tuned for life seems miraculous, leading some to invoke divine involvement. But if there is a multiverse out there – a multitude of universes, each with its own laws of physics – then the conditions we observe may not be unique.Source"

On the flip side, I had several light bulb moments, which is always nice.Among other things, Hawking makes a few great points particularly about the essence of ""reality.""And this passage below, which touches on free will, intrigued me.How can one tell if a being has free will? If one encounters an alien, how can one tell if it is just a robot or it has a mind of its own? The behavior of a robot would be completely determined, unlike that of a being with free will. Thus one could in principle detect a robot as a being whose actions can be predicted. As we said in Chapter 2, this may be impossibly difficult if the being is large and complex. We cannot even solve exactly the equations for three or more particles interacting with each other. Since an alien the size of a human would contain about a thousand trillion trillion particles even if the alien were a robot, it would be impossible to solve the equations and predict what it would do. We would therefore have to say that any complex being has free will--not as a fundamental feature, but as an effective theory, an admission of our inability to do the calculation that would enable us to predict its actions.So basically free will is an illusion, but given our inability to tease out all the complex biological processes that contribute to behavior, it is a good working theory for practical purposes. Thought this was an interesting way of looking at it.Worthy book, well written, and as good an attempt as any to simplify some very complex topics."

There were a couple of sections that I re-read, in an attempt to make concrete some of the more abstract aspects of m-theory. Despite my rudimentary understanding of quantum physics, I still gleaned a great deal from this book and would recommend it to anyone who is even mildly curious. Those who have a more advanced education in physics may find this book too basic, especially the earlier chapters.Questions such as ""What occurred before the big bang?"" and ""what instigated the creation of the universe?"" are addressed in the last chapter, and the earlier chapters build up a nice base of prior research for those unfamiliar with m-theory.

As is the case with most such gifts, I began to read it immediately.I was almost immediately turned off by the text owing to an extraordinary display of ignorance on the part of the authors and the editors, a mistake appearing in the first few pages in their lead-up to what is supposed to be a survey of the history of physics as germinated in Ionian philosophy. Here they note in passing that writing was first employed around 7000 BCE. In fact, so far as we've evidence, writing first appeared about 6000 years ago, in Sumer in approximately 4000 BCE.To make matters worse the authors go on glibly to dismiss philosophy as defunct--not too surprising as their review of it doesn't display much familiarity with the discipline.Beyond this, I found the jokes peppering this slim volume condescending yet sophomoric, unfunny and far too frequent.As regards the physics, I'm hardly qualified the judge, lacking as I do the background in mathematics and research physics to evaluate their positions. However, as someone with some background in philosophy and in the history of science, I find nothing original in their M theory business, such contextualization being rather old hat.There are many fine books written for generalists which attempt to explain modern cosmology and microphysics. This is not one of them."

It's a very good book if you are striving to comprehend the Universe scientifically . And the explanation is simple enough for a normal high school student to understand."

Are you worried you won't understand science because it's dense and dry and has diagrams instead of pictures? This is the book for you, then -- short, succinct, full-colour, and most importantly: clearly explained. The concepts here are intense and heady, but Hawking (and Mlodinow) write about them in a way you can actually understand. The mathematics are lacking, so this is definitely pop-science (and when I tried to explain an experiment referenced to a friend, I realized I wasn't completely sure when or who had conducted it, so..a bibliography would have been nice?). It's like a cosmology buffet: chronologically organized, mostly, from mythology to M-theory, with a sampling of the ideas therein. You'll need to delve further for a real meaty meal, but as appetizers: this shit is high-class.

77,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9512361-andrew-langridge,1,"There are only a couple of positives that I can think to say about this book. Firstly, Hawking has some Feynman-like qualities in being able to lucidly express important ideas in physics such as time dilation in special relativity and the double slit experiment. Secondly, his philosophy of science that he calls model-based realism has many things going for it, although why it is called realism is never fully explained. I did not find this book particularly easy to read, probably because I did not believe from the outset that I was going to be enlightened about our origins.Hawking states ""Philosophy is dead"", but scientists should be especially circumspect when trying to extrapolate their ideas into the humanities. Contemporary readers are still able to detect an elusive thread of truth running through all great philosophical works, and that, like the great works of art, they certainly have not been superseded by developments in science. Scientists meddling in the humanities often give the impression of never having studied the subjects they are criticising and tend to make 'straw man' arguments. The question 'why are we here?' is supposedly solved by science, but is of much more profound significance than Hawking credits. We feel our lives to have value as well as function and our desire throughout history to find life meaningful cannot be dismissed as lacking any significance. 'Is there a creator?' I have no particular axe to grind in favour of religion, but Hawking hypocritically rehashes ancient philosophical arguments for the non-existence of God, such as ""who created God?"". Moreover, religions cannot be treated simply as ontologies devoid of all the mythical elements that have inspired some of the greatest products of art and civilisation. Indeed, Weber tells us that science itself was given impetus by Protestantism.Hawking spends a long time discussing 'anthropic' arguments, but I don't understand their significance. It is only strange that the universe has these particular values for the universal constants or that the Earth's orbit has this narrow range of orbital parameters leading to the evolution of humanity if you have some reference point outside the universe to assess it from. We are doing science from the perspective of the human race as we are here and now, so of course the universe appears to us to be evolved to suit us, otherwise we would not be here to do the science. Hawking advances M Theory as the key to explaining the universe. I am not sufficiently qualified to give an opinion on this, but one thing it seems possible to say is that 'multiverse' theories are unique in science not only for never having been tested but also for being impossible to test. A far-fetched theory for why the dinosaurs died out at least has the possibility of being tested against palaeontological evidence. Any notions we entertain to make the concept of causality apply beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause. I agree with Pliny (ancient wisdom that Hawking dismisses) who states the impossibility of measuring the universe or understanding how it arose. To me, 'universe' by definition means everything that exists, so how can there be any reference point outside it from which to measure it? Cosmological physics turns out paradoxes by the dozen. If the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into? What caused the big bang? If we need mathematics to explain this, what makes us so sure we can rely on mathematics? And what about reasoning itself? What is truth? Oh darn it - another philosophical question!"
78,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1777325-julia,3,"I own several of Hawking's books, and so I was drawn to this thin volume. Obviously his co-author did most of the work, since Hawking's health continues to deteriorate. Mlodinow is a physicist at Caltech and an author in his own right. His name should appear as co-author, but my cynical brain thinks the publisher felt Hawking's name would sell more copies.Much time is given to Richard Feynman and his work in quantum physics. In fact, this book promotes the study of quantum theory as the main answer to human questions about existence. The book does a decent job of tracing the historical ways in which humans tried to comprehend the universe, but it does so in an egotistical way that bothers me. The very first page says ""philosophy is dead"" and advocates science as the only TRUE way to approach the deep human questions about the universe and our place in it.While I do hold science as the basis of my belief system, I'm just a bit concerned that Hawking put his name to a book that occasionally ""sniggers"" at the ides of earlier thinkers. Just because Ptolomy's design of the universe has been proven wrong should not denigrate the desire of his mind to understand the universe.So while I found some of the ideas interesting, WHOEVER really wrote this book comes across as rather egotistical. The sections on quantum theory are very complex, and I had to skip over some of the more esoteric parts.I've always found Hawking's books to be centered on his fascination with understanding this universe. In none of them did I ever find the condescention that is part of this book, and that's a danger for a scientist. Humility should be as important to a scientist as to a philosopher--Socrates knew that when he said he realized the Oracle of Delphi had claimed he was the wisest man in the world. He realized he WAS the wisest man only when he came to his famous conclusion that he ""knew nothing"". This book needed that humility lesson."

81,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35532567-alex,5,"He can get quite technical at times but overall a cogent read. In the end, he jumped a little for me. For example, here he tries to refute that a creator is required:""If the total energy of the universe must always remain zero, and it costs energy to create a body, how can a whole universe be created from nothing? That is why there must be a law like gravity. Because gravity is attractive, gravitational energy is negative: one has to do work to separate a gravitationally bound system... black holes have positive energy [and they balance out the negative energy]. That's why empty space is stable. [that is, a body cannot appear in empty space.] Bodies such as stars or black holes cannot just appear out of nothing. But a whole universe can.Because gravity shapes space and time, it allows space-time to be locally stable but globally unstable. On the scale of the entire universe, the positive energy of the matter can be balanced by the negative gravitational enerby, and so there is no restriction on the creation of whole universes."" (p.180) Nevertheless, it's difficult to find a book of this length that does a better job at explaining some pretty mind-blowing concepts."
82,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"Ever since I was little, I remember the image of Stephen Hawking from TV. I don't know why, but he remained embroidered in my brain after watching a TV show that spoke of him. This must have been 10 years ago, or something like that, but when it was explained to me what he was and what he was doing and did and why he looked the way he looked (remember I was 7 or 8 so I was bound to ask hurtful questions), I became to develop this fondness towards him. In my late years (oh, I'm soooo old), when I was 15 or something like that I started searching information about his work. Now, we have to be clear on one point. I do not, never did and probably (though hopefully not) never will understand physics. It has always been beyond my grasp and I sucked ass at it both at school and at home. Physics for me has to be explained in words and verbal theories. When you lay formulas on a paper, you lost me. And I mean really lost me. This bad understanding of mine is somewhat minimized by the fact that once I understood and learned something, I will never forget it. My memory is really good, and I'm proud to say I've learned a bit of physics both in school and outside of it, just by having it explained over and over again by patient friends that took their time with me. Now, when it comes to anything more complex than normal, simple, high school physics, you lost me again. Quantum physics is something that is absolutely and completely beyond my grasp. Still, in this little book of his, Stephen Hawking managed to explain some things to me, not just me but all of us who read the book. And after finishing it, I felt like I kinda/sorta understood them. Now I know that Stephen Hawking himself isn't able to ""write"" a book. But I've been doing my research and I found out some amazing things about him. The way he pours his thoughts on a paper is by help of his assistant, who sits next to him and asks him simple questions like ""what word are you searching for?"". Then he goes on to trials ""reassuring? reassured? reassure?"". Whenever Hawking agrees to a word, he slightly blinks. Whenever he doesn't, he grins. This is painstaking work. It's horribly slow and you have to be incredibly patient in order to do that. It's monumental work, really, and it deserves respect. Another thing I found out about Stephen Hawking that really impressed me was the fact that when he realized he wouldn't be able to write on a paper and make written calculations of his theories, he developed, inside his mind, a way of ""looking at the universe"". Put simply, there's 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D. We people see 3D. Hawking has developed a means through which he sees, or better imagines in 4D, the dimension that includes time. Isn't that awesome?! I've barely learned to read and write in my whole life! Anyways. I feel like I turned this review into an essay about how great Hawking is. Oh well. Read the book. Read his other books. You'll understand more when you finish them. "

The book gives a good answer to the so-called ""anthropic principle""--namely, that the laws of physics and the fundamental constants appear to be perfectly tuned to allow our world, life, and humans to develop. If any of the laws or fundamental constants were to deviate even slightly, life might not be even possible.The answer to this dilemma, the authors state, is not that God created the laws of physics, and the answer is not that, by some fantastic coincidence, the laws of physics just happen to be perfect. Instead, an infinite number of universes have been created, each with its own unique set of laws. The book is interesting, but seems to fall down in the last chapter, titled, The Grand Design. In the last chapter, the authors argue that M-Theory is the only candidate theory that explains the universe--but that it has not yet been verified by observation. In fact, the authors state that M-Theory has not yet been fully developed; only some characteristics of the theory have been described.

These fields help us understand the universe, that crazy thing that’s all around us, and the fact that we have come so far is simply amazing. In The Grand Design, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow reflect upon how physics achieves this understanding of the universe, with a particular emphasis on how physics can explain the origin of the universe in a way that removes the need for a deity (whom we’ll call God).Mlodinow gets his name on the cover, but this is clearly a Hawking book first and foremost. His name is bigger, and the inside of the dust jacket begins, “The first major work in nearly a decade by one of the world’s great thinkers…"" (emphasis mine). Sorry, Mlodinow! You’re a nice guy, but I guess you’re just not a “great thinker”. (Actually, although I think I’d heard of him before, this is the first time I have encountered one of his “his” books, and now I can go and mark down a bunch of his other books to read. But I should probably talk about this book now.)I shall hereafter refer to Hawking and Mlodinow as “H&M” because it tickles my fancy to fantasize that a clothing chain might write a book on physics.The Grand Design is certainly an engaging treatise, but it is also problematic. I had a lot of fun reading it, and although I have a lot of experience reading about science, I feel confident recommending it for people who might otherwise quirk an eyebrow and say, “Erm … science? I don’t know….” It’s a very short book; it’s extremely conversational in tone, with plenty of analogies; and there are no tests at the end. There are even pictures (albeit not very good ones)! By problematic I mean that, from my own reading and from what I have read of reviews here on Goodreads, H&M confront the role of physics vis-à-vis religion in a way that doesn’t lend itself to clarity and suasion. There seems to be a disconnect between the evidence they present (which is very good) and how they phrase or otherwise communicate the conclusions they draw. This results in an ambiguity that means people will often misinterpret those conclusions or dismiss them out of hand. The Grand Design, one might say, suffers from a grand design flaw.(I am so sorry for that last sentence.)I can give an example from the very first page of the book, which, by the way, begins not with a foreword, preface, or introduction, but Chapter 1. It’s true that this first chapter is very much an introductory chapter that lays the ground for the rest of the book, but I have to give H&M and their editors credit for not subjecting us to another scientist pontificating about these guys or a token preface. The conciseness of this book is appreciated, even if it leads to pithy statements like this:Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.As someone who unequivocally supports science as a way to discover and understand the universe, I must nevertheless shake my head at this passage. Taken literally, it seems like an unnecessarily harsh indictment of philosophy, particularly contemporary philosophy, which is very much alive. Even leaving aside philosophy that concerns itself with things other than those questions (such as “Who are we? Where did we come from?”), philosophers routinely discuss developments in science in their philosophy. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that most scientists also become philosophers—as you will see if you read this book, it is clear that H&M are. However, to be fair to them, I think that what H&M are trying to distinguish—albeit sensationally—is the difference between purely attempting to reason about our existence and our origins (rationalism) and using tools to collect data and make inferences about that existence and those origins (empiricism). The program founded in the Western world by Aristotle and raised onto a pedestal by the Enlightenment scientists has failed: we cannot know the world through reason alone. Bacon, Newton, Galileo, Franklin, etc., realized that we must experiment—we have to conduct tests that anyone with the appropriate knowledge and equipment can reproduce. So philosophy alone cannot take us the entire way, and science provides that next crucial step.If you haven’t read the book, and especially if you approach physics with more wariness than I do, you will find this very weird, but I found the first half of the book much heavier than the last half (with one notable exception). Following that incendiary introductory passage, H&M segue into a deep discussion of what science is, where it is coming from, and where it might be going. Specifically, they introduce a concept called model-dependent realism. And I think this is a fascinating, perhaps even peculiar decision on their part, because I doubt many of their readers would have ever heard of this term—whereas, in comparison, even most laypeople will have heard words like “quantum mechanics” and “general relativity”. H&M have great confidence in their audience, for they have faith that the audience will not be deterred when they drop some philosophy of science in the first chapter.It makes sense to talk about model-dependent realism, though, because it is relevant to M-theory, which is the group of theories that H&M discuss as a candidate for the ultimate “theory of everything”. And kudos to H&M for trying to pull back the curtain on the somewhat mystical way “theories” are constructed and viewed (at least by some scientists). In particular, I love the analogy they use with a map of the world: we can’t accurately transfer a three-dimensional sphere to a two-dimensional surface, so no matter what projection we use (e.g., Mercator, Robinson), it will always be distorted. So just as different projections provide different but useful models of our world, different theories provide different but useful models of the universe. Some of these theories have been collected under the name “M-theory”, and together they might be “the answer” when none of them alone could make the cut.Of course, I like model-dependent realism, because I am a realist, and as H&M say, it “short-circuits all this argument and discussion between the realist and anti-realist schools of thought”. I won’t go into realism versus anti-realism here; that is probably best left for a deeper discussion of the philosophy of science. Suffice it to say, science is not about establishing a single, fixed “truth” outlined by a single set of theories. As H&M point out, Ptolemy and Kepler’s model of a geocentric orbit using epicycles is as valid as our heliocentric model—one certainly can regard the rest of the solar system as “orbiting” the Earth. Yet the geocentric model is fiendishly complex and quickly becomes unwieldy if one ever wants to perform actual calculations; the heliocentric model has the advantage of being simpler and more elegant. So these are all thoughts that H&M want us to consider as they launch into an overview of the state of physics in the twenty-first century.I like that H&M go to the trouble of distinguishing between “probability” as we use the term colloquially and the role probability plays in quantum mechanics. Nancy Kress discusses probability in quantum mechanics at length in 
Probability Sun
, but she only alludes to the difference rather than explicates it. Quantum mechanics is weird and strange and revolutionary precisely because of one word: uncertainty. It blew away the classical world, particularly the deterministic aspect. That pesky Heisenberg uncertainty principle means we’ll never know exactly where a particle is and how fast it is moving. Hence, according to quantum mechanics, asking where a particle is is a meaningless question. Rather, ask what the probability is of a particle being in a particular point in space-time. There is a probability that all the particles in my left arm might actually be in Switzerland right now, but the probability is tiny compared to the probability that they are, in fact, attached to my left shoulder! (And for this I am thankful.)Similarly, The Grand Design finally clarified for me what a boson is. I just have these song lyrics stuck in my head:They suppose that particles have mass becauseThere is this Higgs field that extends through all spaceAnd some particles slow down while other particles raceStraight through like the photon — it has no massBut something heavy like the top quark, it’s draggin’ its ***And the Higgs is a boson that carries a forceAnd makes particles take orders from the field that is its source.If you haven’t already seen it, the Large Hadron Rap is one of the most amazing science raps I have ever seen, and it does an excellent job at explaining what scientists are trying to achieve using the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, I still wasn’t clear on this idea of bosons and force fields. Something about the way H&M explain bosons in The Grand Design finally made it click for me:… according to classical theories, forces are transmitted by fields. But in quantum ield theories the force fields are pictured as being made of various elementary particles called bosons, which are force-carrying particles that fly back and forth between matter particles, transmitting the forces.So the field and particle are dual concepts, one of which applies to classical theories (like relativity) while the other applies to quantum theory. Particles are the language of quantum mechanics, and so force fields have been replaced by a particle that conveys each force: photons for electromagnetism, gluons for the strong force, W and Z bosons for the weak force, and perhaps gravitons for gravity (we haven’t found them yet!). That’s really cool, and I am glad H&M cleared that up for me. This is why I read so many books that cover the same scientific concepts, even similar books by one author: each different method of explaining a concept aids my understanding in some small way.This kind of incremental learning is present in science as well. H&M mention, “Modern technology is sensitive enough to allow us to perform many sensitive tests of general relativity, and it has passed every one”. That relativity is testable and falsifiable—and, correspondingly, has passed all of the tests we have thus far devised—lends great credence to its accuracy as a scientific model. There are, of course, more subtle questions about the roles of testability and falsification play in judging a scientific theory (e.g.: Evolution is arguably not testable, nor is string theory.) What’s important is that H&M emphasize that science is not some kind of mysterious black box where we plug in data in order to obtain inviolable laws of nature. So that’s why I’m fine with people criticizing, say, evolution, because all science should be open to criticism—but the moment that criticism rests on an objection like “it’s only a ‘theory’!” I will stop listening. Our scientific principles are theories because science is self-correcting and constantly improving upon and revising those principles. That is why science is so powerful, so important, and so very cool.By far the most mind-boggling concept in The Grand Design comes at the end, and it is the exception to my earlier remark that I find the first part of the book the heaviest in terms of mental exertion. The ultimate thesis of this book is that we can explain the origin of the universe without invoking a creator deity, a God. I think it is very important to note that H&M are not saying that science can disprove the existence of God, nor is that an objective of The Grand Design. While it is clear that H&M, like myself, do not believe a God exists, this is not their argument. Instead, they are merely removing the necessity of God’s existence. I can see how one can misinterpret the book—hence my initial comments about the disconnect and design flaw. H&M’s scepticism is vividly demonstrated, and they raise some of the problems with attempting to fit God into cosmogony—namely, if God created the universe, who created God? If the answer is that “God is eternal and has always been here,” then why can’t we just replace “God” with “the universe” and leave it at that?This might seem impossible, for we know the universe is not eternal in that sense: we can measure its age (with some degree of precision), and it’s only 13.7 billion years old! Moreover, we know that the universe will eventually reach some sort of end, whether it is heat death, a Big Crunch, etc. H&M resolve this, and that unfortunate singularity at the origin of the universe that prevents our physics from explaining anything, by saying:In the early universe—when the universe was small enough to be governed by both general relativity and quantum theory—there were effectively four dimensions of space and none of time. That means that when we speak of the “beginning” of the universe, we are skirting the subtle issue that as we look backward toward the very early universe, time as we know it does not exist! We must accept that our usual ideas of space and time do not apply to the very early universe.Read that twice: asking what happened “before” the universe existed is meaningless, because time itself did not exist as we regard it today. If that sounds too strange and too incredible to accept, believe me: you are certainly not alone. Much like my experience with bosons, I am only now, after confronting this several times, beginning to wrap my head around this explanation. We are just so obsessed with our view of linear time that thinking of a universe where time functions differently boggles our intuition. It is definitely the most difficult concept H&M present in this book, and as with some of their other explanations, I do not think they entirely succeed in presenting it the way they probably hoped.The Grand Design is ambitious. It is also brief and conversational, as physics books go, and at times this runs up against that ambition. As someone who loves the philosophy of science, loves physics, and has read quite a lot of books about physics, I enjoyed The Grand Design and found it enlightening. Although I recommend it to others with less experience, because it really is a very accessible book, I do so with one reservation: if this is your first physics book, don’t let it be your last. There are so many good ones out there, and while The Grand Design is a fine place to start, it is not the last word on the theory of everything.

88,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120477-jacob,3,"I've read snippets of Hawking's books before and enjoyed them. The particular theme of this one interested me so I picked it up. It started out with some creation myths and a well-paced history of bigger picture science. It bogged down in the middle with an exploration of quantam physics that the author felt was necessary for his subsequent theory of Grand Design, but in reality did little for his theory or the book as a whole.In fact, while engaging, fun to read, and highly informative, the book falls flat at the end. The line of reasoning, from my perspective, leaves much to be desired. Consider a few quotes from the last chapter:""It is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, the the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. In this view it is accepted that some entity exists that needs no creator, and that entity is called God. We claim, however, that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings""While I find the philosophical question of who created God, highly intriguing, I think Mr. Hawking confuses the fact that we are constantly finding laws that govern existence, thereby explaining what we thought was only attributable to divine interference as proof that the divine does not exist. Take this next quote:""Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.""Really? Is it any less plausible that the universe just started randomly 13 billion years ago than a supreme being created it? Either line of thought requires a good amount of faith to believe in. It reminds me of C.S. Lewis' arguments for the existence of God and how they all fell short if you did not start from the premise of belief in something more than the random universe--ultimately you have to believe one way or the other and no amount of ""proof"" will stand up to scrutiny because there is simply too much we don't know.Regarding the Grand Design itself:""M-theory is the UNIFIED [caps mine] theory Einstein was hoping to find. The fact that we human beings-who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature-have been able to come this close to understanding of the laws governing us and our universe is a great triumph...If the theory is confirmed by observation, it will be the successful conclusion of a search going back more than 3000 years. We will have found the grand design.""This is from the last paragraph in the book. The problem is that there is nothing unified about M-theory. Hawking states this in his opening chapter and we learn later in the book that M-theory takes into account electromagnetism, strong forces, weak forces, and string theory in order to produce a multi-verse version of reality that includes 10 to the 500th power possibilities. Not only is this pretty far from fathomable to the average man, but it violates his first two principle of a good model from chapter 3, ""A model is a good model if it: 1. Is elegant 2. Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements"". A convoluted mish-mash of theories that produces so many various elements (mathematically computable or not) is hardly a ""good model"". Due to the sheer volume of calculations necessary it is hard to confirm fulfillment of the last two criteria that the good model: ""3. Agrees with and explains all existing observations 4. Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can disprove or falsify the model if they are not borne out.""Don't get me wrong. I am no quantam physicist nor cosmologist and certainly don't have the knowledge to disprove any theories in these fields. Likely we are on the right track with something like M-theory. However, it is not an easily understood unified theory (such may not even exist), and it certainly doesn't provide any answers about the why of the universe as it claims to. As with much of both science and religion, the more we learn and understand, the more questions arise.The poor finishing premises of this book and agonizingly thick explanations in the middle of this work, knock it down two notches, but it is still worth the read if this sort of thing interests you. Solid 3 stars."
89,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1917722-chy,4,"Since I read this here book, I’m going to attempt to talk like a smart person. It’s a half-hearted attempt and is doomed to failure, as hopefully you realize it already done did.“There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.”(Douglas Adams)This book totally agrees with that, in the end. I have this book because my sixteen-year-old stepson had to buy it for a class he was going to take, and then decided not to take the class. Perhaps that’s why I so strongly perceive it as written toward a “younger” audience. But, as with a lot of things written by very intelligent people toward an audience they knew to be dumber than they are, there are a lot of jokes that sort of insult your intelligence without really meaning to. You know, the kind of jokes that make teenagers really roll their eyes, which is especially bad when they’re in there to try to “relate to” the very people who roll their eyes at it.In talking about the Stoics describing “physical processes in legal terms and [believing] them to be in need of enforcement, even though the objects required to ‘obey’ the laws were inanimate”: “If you think it is hard to get humans to follow traffic laws, imagine convincing an asteroid to move along an ellipse.”It tends to be distracting and awkward and tacked-in-there. And it’s not needed; the book’s written in simple language, and it’s exceedingly easy to read, which makes it easy to be interested in it so long as one has at least a little interest in the subject anyway--which is not something these jokes would induce in any case. Still, it wasn’t enough to really degrade my opinion of the book.I did get a little frustrated with the over-simplification of things here and there, because so many times that kind of thing leaves out the explanations I come into this kind of thing looking for. And when I get all frustrated like that, I miss things, which was my main problem in college. The teachers tend to want to get to this point or that point and spit out some model along the way that I’d really like to dwell on, but their explanation is, “It exists because we need it for the equation all of us are on now so come on, come on.”I don’t even like to think about how long it took me to finally figure out where π came from and why we use it, and how frustrated I was with teachers who kept telling me, “Just feed your numbers into the formula and give the damn answer.”But I only hit that wall, really, there in the middle. The thing I found most useful about the book was the scientific history lessons. Reminders of when people like Newton and Aristotle lived, and just what they came up with---before we modified and reworded it. That was my favorite aspect of the book by far.My other favorite thing was the introduction to John Conway’s Game of Life. And I can’t believe I’ve never run across it before. How completely and utterly baffling, to me, that I never have. (Or maybe I have and it was just never presented in such a memorable way?) You can even download it and play with it as a “game”: http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/I’m not sure either of those links can show at all why I love the implications so much (because I haven’t actually read through those sites), but to explain I have to plagiarize pages of this book, so I’ll leave it be. And maybe call a buddy to see if he can download Life for me. Heh."
90,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,4,"It's a funny thing being a cosmologist in the greater Los Angeles area. Back when I was a partying single graduate student, I'd frequently hit the town for some fun. Inevitably I'd meet someone, strike up a conversation, and they might ask me what I did for a living.""Oh, I'm a cosmologist."" ""Cosmetologist? Cool, do you do make-up for movies?"" ""Um...not unless rouge is a component of dark matter."" (ba-da-bum)""...""""I make detectors and use them to study the origins and geometry of our universe."" ""Uh. No way. You ever work in movies?""I discovered after a few years of this that it was much easier and simpler to tell people I was Mary Poppins at Disneyland. Without exception, folks believed me, made a joke and moved on. The physics thing just cause wrinkled faces, and very odd non-sequiturs. Once I had a guy tell me all about a distant cousin who studied shrimp in the Netherlands. Frequently I'd get the physicist = physician mix-up. Luckily no one ever showed me their rash. Oh well, such is the life of the lonely, misunderstood cosmologist.Why am I telling you about all my misadventures in life? Oh yeah, to let you know that my background is observational cosmology. (I.e. making devices, detectors, instruments and doing experiments in labs, in Antarctica and on space-born projects.) I'm not a theorist, and most definitely not into string theory/membrane theory/M-theory. That stuff isn't even touched upon in most graduate programs. It's esoteric, wicked complicated, and honestly still in a very nascent stage.So, I'm not qualified to comment on M-theory being THE answer to The Grand Design as Hawking and Mlodinow so insistently propose. The question then becomes did they sell me on the idea. I dunno... maybe? It was all so very glossed over, overwhelmed by all the history and background needed to give the reader an appropriate framework. Then when they finally game to the climax of the story, where all the previous information should coalesce, M-theory barely got much of an explanation or treatment at all.I got the impression they wanted to push this Grand Idea, a wrap-up of all previous ideas, made with sweeping statements and generalizations to get press. Plus, if it turns out to work and be right, they can point to this very thin book and say ""A-ha!"" That's why I removed a star.Now, if you are looking to learn more about the science of the universe this is just the book for you. They do an excellent job explaining aspects of special relativity, general relativity, particle physics, early-universe physics, even my favorite field, the CMB. (Which maddeningly they call the CMBR, a very outdated term, and refer to the fluctuations as being in the microwave regime, even though they are sub-millimeter radiation! Grrr!) They even throw in a ton of historical context, which helps the reader understand the difficulties of the field and the constantly evolving nature of science.The science is great, you will learn a ton. Really. The writing is clear in that no-nonsense style Hawking is so famous for. Unfortunately in a few areas the explanations get really muddled to the point of incomprehensibility, and I suspect that might be Mlodinow's doing, since those muddled spots fall in his particular area of expertise. One would expect a research scientist in the field (even if she's a lowly experimentalist) should be able to breeze through all their scientific lessons. I found the string theory section to be really tough-going, with pretty poorly thought out examples. But it is a very esoteric field, and maybe there just aren't easy ways to help lay-folks visualize the 11-dimensional space and the vibrating membranes?Speaking of clear teaching examples, the book is filled with ways to help the reader visualize some very hard concepts. Gravity affects space-time like having a rubber sheet for your pool table, then pulling down on one spot right in the middle. The balls will curve around the area in much the same way that objects do near-ish black holes. The ""strings"" in string theory are described to be like a straw, with a surface space, but curled up on itself. However, from very far away a straw looks like a 2-dimensional line.And yet a few of their examples obviously fall short, which I suppose all stand-ins for the real thing will eventually do. The one that really stood out like a a sore thumb was the balloon-as-expanding-universe. Their illustration looks like someone could take a marker and draw little galaxies on a balloon. Then as the balloon is filled with more air and expands, all galaxies will move away from each other independently. The first trouble is that the galaxies, if drawn on, would expand themselves, which doesn't actually happen. (The mass and hence gravity of galaxies is a stronger force than the expansion of the universe.) In the text, it's made clear that the galaxies have to be treated as points on the balloon, but the graphic is a bit misleading. Secondly, the obvious question to the balloon is: Okay, the balloon expands into our 3-dimensional space, so what is the universe expanding into? They certainly touch on the answer later, but never refer back to our balloon. What a shame.At any rate, here's my advice: Believe their grand M-theory answer or don't, I don't think it matters as long as you have learned a few things about our scientific understanding of the universe along the way.Since I made fun of ""The Industry"" suitors I encountered around Los Angeles, I should relate a tale of the foolish physicists. Create a supersymmetry of courtship mishaps or something. I was at a party on campus, which was completely populated by science grad students, and maybe a few random stray people. I met a guy, he seemed nice enough, so we chatted about motorcycles for a while. He asked me what I studied, so I very jokingly told him I was a Theoretical Cosmetologist, and a student at the neighboring university (which has many, many more women). Ridiculous, right? The guy fell for it hook, line and sinker, and wanted to know more details of this theoretical cosmetology. So I told him all about color theory, combining it with an understanding of personality traits, and the effect of shadowing on first-impressions. Meanwhile, my co-workers stood behind him, trying to hold in their laughter. It was mean, but he believed me! If you ever meet me in person, only believe about 63% of what I say. The rest is a joke. And that's a scientifically proven fact."
91,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"When this book was released, I was reading a story about it on-line, and the headline said something like: “Stephen Hawking Says There Is No God”. Then I made the critical mistake of looking at the user comments under the story. It was the usual collection of badly spelled notes from ignorant asshats who tried to say that stupid science didn’t know nuthin’ or that it was all Obama’s fault. But one in particular caught my eye. It was by someone who undoubtedly dabbles in both neurosurgery and rocket science in his-or-her spare time, and it said something along the lines of: “THAT”S WHYY STEVN HAWKENS IS IN WHEEELCHAR!!!!!! BCAUSE HE DON”T BELIVE IN GOD!! JEBUS IS PUNSINGHING HIM!!!”Which got me thinking about why anyone would expect a guy who has suffered from ALS and been confined to a wheelchair for most of his life to believe in God? Among the many people who have just cause to question that a loving God is waiting in heaven to dish them out a heaping plate of Sky Cake, I’d think that Stephen Hawking would be one of them.It’s that kind of thinking that Hawking and Mlodinow take on here. Some people will point out the odds against any kind of life existing on Earth and say that God must have set it all in motion and made this place just for us and that it’s proof of an intelligent creator. Or you listen to a scientist like Hawking who points out that there’s whole multiverses where life doesn’t exist and that the only reason we know how lucky we are is that we exist to appreciate how lucky we are. Basing the idea that there must be some kind of intelligent creator simply because we’re here is bad science.And that’s Hawking’s point. This isn’t an anti-God book, it’s a pro-science and pro-critical thinking book. Hawking does a nice job in the early chapters of giving a brief overview of the development of the scientific method and how beliefs in mysterious beings have been incorporated into theories and then debunked over the centuries. Then he lays out the flaws in the models that insist that there has to be some kind of creator being in the mix. Even though Hawking does his best to dumb down the quantum physics that he claims proves his point and provides lots of handy pictures and graphics to help out the math and science challenged like me, it’s not exactly light reading. It’s short at 181 pages, and that helps, but while I’m fascinated by this kind of stuff, I’m also stupid enough that I had to read over some sections a couple of times before I thought I had a handle on it.It’s enlightening and a nice overview of both the scientific method and quantum physics, but unfortunately, I can’t see any of the people who should read this actually picking it up.

Stephen Hawking is smarter than I am. That's no big feat because two of my cats are smarter than I am. The other cat is a certifiable idiot. But Hawking is way smarter than I am. The Grand Design is Hawking's explanation, more or less, about why the universe is the way it is. The answer comes down to M-theory which is more of a combining of explanations than one single unifying theory. Many reviewers seem to think Hawking is saying there is no God but he really seems to be stating that God is irrelevant. The real question is did we come from something or nothing. The beginning of an answer involves an understanding of quantum physics and multiverses that Hawking put as well into laymen's term as we can hope for. I don't pretend to understand everything in this book. I'm still contemplating why the world needs hairballs. But I did immensely enjoy reading this short book and can honestly say I understand a little bit more."

98,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"I have a feeling that the publishing industry is milking Stephen Hawking. There was a time when we had a dashing physicist named Richard Feynman who used LSD and played banjo in a strip club. The naked pole dancers didn’t distract him from formulating quantum electrodynamics. He was quite a genius, and he was all over the place with his talks and popular books. But he’s dead. Now Stephen Hawking seems to be the coolest physicist around. He’s paralyzed and wheelchair-bound, and he speaks through a voice synthesizer by twitching a tiny working cheek muscle against a screen to pick up a displayed word. How cool is that! So he’s become quite a celebrity, and he fully deserves it. The public is fascinated with him. But that doesn’t mean a whole lot for the quality of his books. I’ve read better pop-physics books than this one. Besides, I didn’t see anything new here. This book got more publicity because it’s supposed to take on the question of God. It’s no secret that the great biologists and physicists tend to be atheists. That’s a very telling fact. But having acknowledged that, I don’t see a point in a physicist trying to “disprove” God through physics. Upon being asked by Napoleon where God fits in his physics, Laplace is reported to having said: “Sire, I have not needed that hypothesis.” Science, by definition, does not and cannot use the God hypothesis. I don’t see why it should get into the business of rejecting that hypothesis. Those who are inclined to reject God can point to the findings of biology and cosmology for support. But that is quite different from a physicist setting out to refute God based on physics. As for the God-rejecting physics – it can be summarized in two points: 1) While no individual physical object can appear out of nothing, an entire universe can. This is because the sum-total of the energy in the universe is zero. 2) There are almost an infinite number of universes popping out of nothing into existence. One of them, like the one where we live, can, by mere chance, have the right properties (laws and constants of physics) for the emergence of starts and planets and eventually life. The book goes into explaining the physics behind these two claims. Unless you’re a physicist as good as Hawking, there’s nothing you can say about his physics. "

His statement, that the Universe unpacks itself and therefore does not need a creator is based on some really flawed logic called 'model dependent realism'. MDR is a way of comparing reality to a model, if the model produces the same observable characteristics as observed in reality then the model is said to be as true as any other model.Imagine this, if there was equal amounts of incriminating evidence that two people committed a crime and prosecution lawyers could build a case against both men then under MDR both are guilty of the crime irrespective of the fact that it only happened one way. By invoking MDR Hawking is blatantly ignoring the lessons of the past, that evidence makes or breaks models, and so far M-theory is unsupported by evidence.In fact if you follow the line of Hawking's logic, rather than his conclusion, you can even say that Hawking categorically proves the existence of God - All be it as an MDR model of Universe creation. However he selectively ignores this and only looks at how MDR supports his religious beliefs. But, there are a lot of things wrong with this book. Let me explain....Hawking contradicts himself. He says that Kepler, Galileo, Descartes and Newton saw that the laws of physics were the work of God and that this God was not the God the Old Testament. However we do not have enough written down about the religious beliefs off all of the above to know that this is true and this statement is certainly not true for Newton who was as Christian as you could get. Hawking is doing something quite unscientific here, he is trying to re-write history. It is an embarrassment to atheism that some of the greatest geniuses off all time could have a religious belief like the rest of us and so Hawking is trying to apologise for this by making out that somehow the religious beliefs of these scientists were different to that of the rest of the population.Hawking suggests at some points that we must take the Universe at face value, that we must consider real only what is measurably real and then contradicts himself (when talking about the holographic theory) by saying that the Universe may be fundamentally different to how we observe it.Hawking suggests that God doesn’t intervene, and defines intervening as a suspension of the normal laws of physics. But what about intervention using the laws of physics. What about a God that intervenes only rarely. Under MDR all are as real as a God that never intervenes. Hawking laughs at the idea that we might all be the figment of someone else’s dream, but under the logic he himself invokes, this theory is as real as M-theory.Hawking describes how our perception of reality can be changed by placing upside down glasses on our faces. Our minds are so set in their ways that they refuse the new reality and change the input to fit with the model of the reality in our heads. In MDR the model each person has in their heads is a real reality. Reality is unique to each observer. If God exists in my model, it is true for my Universe, if he doesn’t in yours then God really is absent from yours.Hawking describes how St Augustine concluded that the Earth was young due to the ages of people in the bible, but at the time there was no recognised evidence to suggest otherwise. According to MDR young Earth creationism was the reality, since no other model existed. He says that young Earth creationism in the present day is as real as the big bang theory. But Hawking is breaking his own logic here. In today’s day and age we have a lot more evidence that the Universe began with something like the big bang which means that under MDR, this model is considered to be MORE real.Hawking describes how Hubble’s model of the Universe was accepted because it was the most natural model but naturalness and elegance is purely subjective. In MDR plausibility is not measured. Hawking mentions how the laws of nature determine a range of probabilities of various futures and past, and yet avoids the issue about how a selection is made. Somehow a selection IS made.Hawking describes how the Universe is comprehensible because it can be modelled. This is not true. Only the model is comprehensible. The Universe is not the model; the Universe is infinite and by its very nature incomprehensible and thanks to quantum physics not even entirely measurable.The bits that really make me cringe, and I have a degree and a PhD in this, is where Hawking gets his science wrong. Hawking suggests that the standard model “agrees with all current evidence”, but this is not true. Experiments have observed that the neutrino has mass, and the standard model cannot account for this.Hawking suggests that inflation in the early Universe really did happen, but recent observations by his old friend Roger Penrose have cast serious doubts over this. Hawking also suggests that this Universe is casually disconnected from the other possibilities, and so what we experience is just one possibility. However M-theory suggests that gravity information leaks between membranes, thus collapsing the universe into one possibility. This one.Hawking suggests the Universe has 4 dimensions of space time as the result of our selection. In his words the Universe is like this because this is one of the possibilities it could have been and our selection is this. But as Einstein said, “God doesn’t play dice”. To suggest that some thing’s have no fundamental reason for existing is like saying “Everybody stop all scientific research, because there is no fundamental reason for any of this”.Hawking also suggests that the act of creation is understandable purely within the realm of science, but doesn’t mention that we have no science that works at t=0. The science goof that nearly had me eating my kindle in apoplexy was when Hawking suggests that black holes have positive gravitational potential energy. If that were true, the milky way would be spread around the Universe. Hawking does do well at talking his way out of the fine tuning argument. He effectively kills that argument dead and I agree we do not need God to explain why the Universe is perfect for our existence. But my reply is that, people shouldn’t have been using that line of apologism in the first place because it doesn’t make theological sense, let alone scientific sense. According to Christian doctrine God made creation for himself, he did not make it for us.Hawking does well at explaining how quantum mechanics and relativity on intermediate scales produce Newtonian like physics. This is the Hawking we know and love and this book should have been full of this kind of stuff. Instead it is full of laughable pseudoscience and theology. Model dependent realism is not robust enough for Hawking’s confidence in it and doesn’t hold up to scrutiny or close inspection.The theological work in this is very much of the style of Dawkins and others who successfully disprove Gods of their own imagining. They create a God, give it powers and then disprove the God that they have created. But they don’t get anywhere near the God that people worship in churches. Hawking’s intellect outstrips his own imagination and it really shows in this work. I am very happily the other way around."

01.11.2016: Stephen Hawking warns that the Higgs Boson field could collapse, resulting in a chain reaction that would take in the whole universe with it.
 The nihilists have been right all along...M-theory: Doubts linger over godless multiverseSTEPHEN HAWKING'S new book The Grand Design sparked a furore over whether physics can be used to disprove the existence of God. But few have noted that the idea at the core of the book, M-theory, is the subject of an ongoing scientific debate – specifically over the very aspect of the theory that might scrap the need for a divine creator.That the laws of nature in our universe are finely tuned for life seems miraculous, leading some to invoke divine involvement. But if there is a multiverse out there – a multitude of universes, each with its own laws of physics – then the conditions we observe may not be unique.Source"

On the flip side, I had several light bulb moments, which is always nice.Among other things, Hawking makes a few great points particularly about the essence of ""reality.""And this passage below, which touches on free will, intrigued me.How can one tell if a being has free will? If one encounters an alien, how can one tell if it is just a robot or it has a mind of its own? The behavior of a robot would be completely determined, unlike that of a being with free will. Thus one could in principle detect a robot as a being whose actions can be predicted. As we said in Chapter 2, this may be impossibly difficult if the being is large and complex. We cannot even solve exactly the equations for three or more particles interacting with each other. Since an alien the size of a human would contain about a thousand trillion trillion particles even if the alien were a robot, it would be impossible to solve the equations and predict what it would do. We would therefore have to say that any complex being has free will--not as a fundamental feature, but as an effective theory, an admission of our inability to do the calculation that would enable us to predict its actions.So basically free will is an illusion, but given our inability to tease out all the complex biological processes that contribute to behavior, it is a good working theory for practical purposes. Thought this was an interesting way of looking at it.Worthy book, well written, and as good an attempt as any to simplify some very complex topics."

There were a couple of sections that I re-read, in an attempt to make concrete some of the more abstract aspects of m-theory. Despite my rudimentary understanding of quantum physics, I still gleaned a great deal from this book and would recommend it to anyone who is even mildly curious. Those who have a more advanced education in physics may find this book too basic, especially the earlier chapters.Questions such as ""What occurred before the big bang?"" and ""what instigated the creation of the universe?"" are addressed in the last chapter, and the earlier chapters build up a nice base of prior research for those unfamiliar with m-theory.

As is the case with most such gifts, I began to read it immediately.I was almost immediately turned off by the text owing to an extraordinary display of ignorance on the part of the authors and the editors, a mistake appearing in the first few pages in their lead-up to what is supposed to be a survey of the history of physics as germinated in Ionian philosophy. Here they note in passing that writing was first employed around 7000 BCE. In fact, so far as we've evidence, writing first appeared about 6000 years ago, in Sumer in approximately 4000 BCE.To make matters worse the authors go on glibly to dismiss philosophy as defunct--not too surprising as their review of it doesn't display much familiarity with the discipline.Beyond this, I found the jokes peppering this slim volume condescending yet sophomoric, unfunny and far too frequent.As regards the physics, I'm hardly qualified the judge, lacking as I do the background in mathematics and research physics to evaluate their positions. However, as someone with some background in philosophy and in the history of science, I find nothing original in their M theory business, such contextualization being rather old hat.There are many fine books written for generalists which attempt to explain modern cosmology and microphysics. This is not one of them."

Are you worried you won't understand science because it's dense and dry and has diagrams instead of pictures? This is the book for you, then -- short, succinct, full-colour, and most importantly: clearly explained. The concepts here are intense and heady, but Hawking (and Mlodinow) write about them in a way you can actually understand. The mathematics are lacking, so this is definitely pop-science (and when I tried to explain an experiment referenced to a friend, I realized I wasn't completely sure when or who had conducted it, so..a bibliography would have been nice?). It's like a cosmology buffet: chronologically organized, mostly, from mythology to M-theory, with a sampling of the ideas therein. You'll need to delve further for a real meaty meal, but as appetizers: this shit is high-class.

107,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9512361-andrew-langridge,1,"There are only a couple of positives that I can think to say about this book. Firstly, Hawking has some Feynman-like qualities in being able to lucidly express important ideas in physics such as time dilation in special relativity and the double slit experiment. Secondly, his philosophy of science that he calls model-based realism has many things going for it, although why it is called realism is never fully explained. I did not find this book particularly easy to read, probably because I did not believe from the outset that I was going to be enlightened about our origins.Hawking states ""Philosophy is dead"", but scientists should be especially circumspect when trying to extrapolate their ideas into the humanities. Contemporary readers are still able to detect an elusive thread of truth running through all great philosophical works, and that, like the great works of art, they certainly have not been superseded by developments in science. Scientists meddling in the humanities often give the impression of never having studied the subjects they are criticising and tend to make 'straw man' arguments. The question 'why are we here?' is supposedly solved by science, but is of much more profound significance than Hawking credits. We feel our lives to have value as well as function and our desire throughout history to find life meaningful cannot be dismissed as lacking any significance. 'Is there a creator?' I have no particular axe to grind in favour of religion, but Hawking hypocritically rehashes ancient philosophical arguments for the non-existence of God, such as ""who created God?"". Moreover, religions cannot be treated simply as ontologies devoid of all the mythical elements that have inspired some of the greatest products of art and civilisation. Indeed, Weber tells us that science itself was given impetus by Protestantism.Hawking spends a long time discussing 'anthropic' arguments, but I don't understand their significance. It is only strange that the universe has these particular values for the universal constants or that the Earth's orbit has this narrow range of orbital parameters leading to the evolution of humanity if you have some reference point outside the universe to assess it from. We are doing science from the perspective of the human race as we are here and now, so of course the universe appears to us to be evolved to suit us, otherwise we would not be here to do the science. Hawking advances M Theory as the key to explaining the universe. I am not sufficiently qualified to give an opinion on this, but one thing it seems possible to say is that 'multiverse' theories are unique in science not only for never having been tested but also for being impossible to test. A far-fetched theory for why the dinosaurs died out at least has the possibility of being tested against palaeontological evidence. Any notions we entertain to make the concept of causality apply beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause. I agree with Pliny (ancient wisdom that Hawking dismisses) who states the impossibility of measuring the universe or understanding how it arose. To me, 'universe' by definition means everything that exists, so how can there be any reference point outside it from which to measure it? Cosmological physics turns out paradoxes by the dozen. If the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into? What caused the big bang? If we need mathematics to explain this, what makes us so sure we can rely on mathematics? And what about reasoning itself? What is truth? Oh darn it - another philosophical question!"
108,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1777325-julia,3,"I own several of Hawking's books, and so I was drawn to this thin volume. Obviously his co-author did most of the work, since Hawking's health continues to deteriorate. Mlodinow is a physicist at Caltech and an author in his own right. His name should appear as co-author, but my cynical brain thinks the publisher felt Hawking's name would sell more copies.Much time is given to Richard Feynman and his work in quantum physics. In fact, this book promotes the study of quantum theory as the main answer to human questions about existence. The book does a decent job of tracing the historical ways in which humans tried to comprehend the universe, but it does so in an egotistical way that bothers me. The very first page says ""philosophy is dead"" and advocates science as the only TRUE way to approach the deep human questions about the universe and our place in it.While I do hold science as the basis of my belief system, I'm just a bit concerned that Hawking put his name to a book that occasionally ""sniggers"" at the ides of earlier thinkers. Just because Ptolomy's design of the universe has been proven wrong should not denigrate the desire of his mind to understand the universe.So while I found some of the ideas interesting, WHOEVER really wrote this book comes across as rather egotistical. The sections on quantum theory are very complex, and I had to skip over some of the more esoteric parts.I've always found Hawking's books to be centered on his fascination with understanding this universe. In none of them did I ever find the condescention that is part of this book, and that's a danger for a scientist. Humility should be as important to a scientist as to a philosopher--Socrates knew that when he said he realized the Oracle of Delphi had claimed he was the wisest man in the world. He realized he WAS the wisest man only when he came to his famous conclusion that he ""knew nothing"". This book needed that humility lesson."

For example, here he tries to refute that a creator is required:""If the total energy of the universe must always remain zero, and it costs energy to create a body, how can a whole universe be created from nothing? That is why there must be a law like gravity. Because gravity is attractive, gravitational energy is negative: one has to do work to separate a gravitationally bound system... black holes have positive energy [and they balance out the negative energy]. That's why empty space is stable. [that is, a body cannot appear in empty space.] Bodies such as stars or black holes cannot just appear out of nothing. But a whole universe can.Because gravity shapes space and time, it allows space-time to be locally stable but globally unstable. On the scale of the entire universe, the positive energy of the matter can be balanced by the negative gravitational enerby, and so there is no restriction on the creation of whole universes."" (p.180) Nevertheless, it's difficult to find a book of this length that does a better job at explaining some pretty mind-blowing concepts."
112,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"Ever since I was little, I remember the image of Stephen Hawking from TV. I don't know why, but he remained embroidered in my brain after watching a TV show that spoke of him. This must have been 10 years ago, or something like that, but when it was explained to me what he was and what he was doing and did and why he looked the way he looked (remember I was 7 or 8 so I was bound to ask hurtful questions), I became to develop this fondness towards him. In my late years (oh, I'm soooo old), when I was 15 or something like that I started searching information about his work. Now, we have to be clear on one point. I do not, never did and probably (though hopefully not) never will understand physics. It has always been beyond my grasp and I sucked ass at it both at school and at home. Physics for me has to be explained in words and verbal theories. When you lay formulas on a paper, you lost me. And I mean really lost me. This bad understanding of mine is somewhat minimized by the fact that once I understood and learned something, I will never forget it. My memory is really good, and I'm proud to say I've learned a bit of physics both in school and outside of it, just by having it explained over and over again by patient friends that took their time with me. Now, when it comes to anything more complex than normal, simple, high school physics, you lost me again. Quantum physics is something that is absolutely and completely beyond my grasp. Still, in this little book of his, Stephen Hawking managed to explain some things to me, not just me but all of us who read the book. And after finishing it, I felt like I kinda/sorta understood them. Now I know that Stephen Hawking himself isn't able to ""write"" a book. But I've been doing my research and I found out some amazing things about him. The way he pours his thoughts on a paper is by help of his assistant, who sits next to him and asks him simple questions like ""what word are you searching for?"". Then he goes on to trials ""reassuring? reassured? reassure?"". Whenever Hawking agrees to a word, he slightly blinks. Whenever he doesn't, he grins. This is painstaking work. It's horribly slow and you have to be incredibly patient in order to do that. It's monumental work, really, and it deserves respect. Another thing I found out about Stephen Hawking that really impressed me was the fact that when he realized he wouldn't be able to write on a paper and make written calculations of his theories, he developed, inside his mind, a way of ""looking at the universe"". Put simply, there's 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D. We people see 3D. Hawking has developed a means through which he sees, or better imagines in 4D, the dimension that includes time. Isn't that awesome?! I've barely learned to read and write in my whole life! Anyways. I feel like I turned this review into an essay about how great Hawking is. Oh well. Read the book. Read his other books. You'll understand more when you finish them. "

The book gives a good answer to the so-called ""anthropic principle""--namely, that the laws of physics and the fundamental constants appear to be perfectly tuned to allow our world, life, and humans to develop. If any of the laws or fundamental constants were to deviate even slightly, life might not be even possible.The answer to this dilemma, the authors state, is not that God created the laws of physics, and the answer is not that, by some fantastic coincidence, the laws of physics just happen to be perfect. Instead, an infinite number of universes have been created, each with its own unique set of laws. The book is interesting, but seems to fall down in the last chapter, titled, The Grand Design. In the last chapter, the authors argue that M-Theory is the only candidate theory that explains the universe--but that it has not yet been verified by observation. In fact, the authors state that M-Theory has not yet been fully developed; only some characteristics of the theory have been described.

These fields help us understand the universe, that crazy thing that’s all around us, and the fact that we have come so far is simply amazing. In The Grand Design, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow reflect upon how physics achieves this understanding of the universe, with a particular emphasis on how physics can explain the origin of the universe in a way that removes the need for a deity (whom we’ll call God).Mlodinow gets his name on the cover, but this is clearly a Hawking book first and foremost. His name is bigger, and the inside of the dust jacket begins, “The first major work in nearly a decade by one of the world’s great thinkers…"" (emphasis mine). Sorry, Mlodinow! You’re a nice guy, but I guess you’re just not a “great thinker”. (Actually, although I think I’d heard of him before, this is the first time I have encountered one of his “his” books, and now I can go and mark down a bunch of his other books to read. But I should probably talk about this book now.)I shall hereafter refer to Hawking and Mlodinow as “H&M” because it tickles my fancy to fantasize that a clothing chain might write a book on physics.The Grand Design is certainly an engaging treatise, but it is also problematic. I had a lot of fun reading it, and although I have a lot of experience reading about science, I feel confident recommending it for people who might otherwise quirk an eyebrow and say, “Erm … science? I don’t know….” It’s a very short book; it’s extremely conversational in tone, with plenty of analogies; and there are no tests at the end. There are even pictures (albeit not very good ones)! By problematic I mean that, from my own reading and from what I have read of reviews here on Goodreads, H&M confront the role of physics vis-à-vis religion in a way that doesn’t lend itself to clarity and suasion. There seems to be a disconnect between the evidence they present (which is very good) and how they phrase or otherwise communicate the conclusions they draw. This results in an ambiguity that means people will often misinterpret those conclusions or dismiss them out of hand. The Grand Design, one might say, suffers from a grand design flaw.(I am so sorry for that last sentence.)I can give an example from the very first page of the book, which, by the way, begins not with a foreword, preface, or introduction, but Chapter 1. It’s true that this first chapter is very much an introductory chapter that lays the ground for the rest of the book, but I have to give H&M and their editors credit for not subjecting us to another scientist pontificating about these guys or a token preface. The conciseness of this book is appreciated, even if it leads to pithy statements like this:Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.As someone who unequivocally supports science as a way to discover and understand the universe, I must nevertheless shake my head at this passage. Taken literally, it seems like an unnecessarily harsh indictment of philosophy, particularly contemporary philosophy, which is very much alive. Even leaving aside philosophy that concerns itself with things other than those questions (such as “Who are we? Where did we come from?”), philosophers routinely discuss developments in science in their philosophy. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that most scientists also become philosophers—as you will see if you read this book, it is clear that H&M are. However, to be fair to them, I think that what H&M are trying to distinguish—albeit sensationally—is the difference between purely attempting to reason about our existence and our origins (rationalism) and using tools to collect data and make inferences about that existence and those origins (empiricism). The program founded in the Western world by Aristotle and raised onto a pedestal by the Enlightenment scientists has failed: we cannot know the world through reason alone. Bacon, Newton, Galileo, Franklin, etc., realized that we must experiment—we have to conduct tests that anyone with the appropriate knowledge and equipment can reproduce. So philosophy alone cannot take us the entire way, and science provides that next crucial step.If you haven’t read the book, and especially if you approach physics with more wariness than I do, you will find this very weird, but I found the first half of the book much heavier than the last half (with one notable exception). Following that incendiary introductory passage, H&M segue into a deep discussion of what science is, where it is coming from, and where it might be going. Specifically, they introduce a concept called model-dependent realism. And I think this is a fascinating, perhaps even peculiar decision on their part, because I doubt many of their readers would have ever heard of this term—whereas, in comparison, even most laypeople will have heard words like “quantum mechanics” and “general relativity”. H&M have great confidence in their audience, for they have faith that the audience will not be deterred when they drop some philosophy of science in the first chapter.It makes sense to talk about model-dependent realism, though, because it is relevant to M-theory, which is the group of theories that H&M discuss as a candidate for the ultimate “theory of everything”. And kudos to H&M for trying to pull back the curtain on the somewhat mystical way “theories” are constructed and viewed (at least by some scientists). In particular, I love the analogy they use with a map of the world: we can’t accurately transfer a three-dimensional sphere to a two-dimensional surface, so no matter what projection we use (e.g., Mercator, Robinson), it will always be distorted. So just as different projections provide different but useful models of our world, different theories provide different but useful models of the universe. Some of these theories have been collected under the name “M-theory”, and together they might be “the answer” when none of them alone could make the cut.Of course, I like model-dependent realism, because I am a realist, and as H&M say, it “short-circuits all this argument and discussion between the realist and anti-realist schools of thought”. I won’t go into realism versus anti-realism here; that is probably best left for a deeper discussion of the philosophy of science. Suffice it to say, science is not about establishing a single, fixed “truth” outlined by a single set of theories. As H&M point out, Ptolemy and Kepler’s model of a geocentric orbit using epicycles is as valid as our heliocentric model—one certainly can regard the rest of the solar system as “orbiting” the Earth. Yet the geocentric model is fiendishly complex and quickly becomes unwieldy if one ever wants to perform actual calculations; the heliocentric model has the advantage of being simpler and more elegant. So these are all thoughts that H&M want us to consider as they launch into an overview of the state of physics in the twenty-first century.I like that H&M go to the trouble of distinguishing between “probability” as we use the term colloquially and the role probability plays in quantum mechanics. Nancy Kress discusses probability in quantum mechanics at length in 
Probability Sun
, but she only alludes to the difference rather than explicates it. Quantum mechanics is weird and strange and revolutionary precisely because of one word: uncertainty. It blew away the classical world, particularly the deterministic aspect. That pesky Heisenberg uncertainty principle means we’ll never know exactly where a particle is and how fast it is moving. Hence, according to quantum mechanics, asking where a particle is is a meaningless question. Rather, ask what the probability is of a particle being in a particular point in space-time. There is a probability that all the particles in my left arm might actually be in Switzerland right now, but the probability is tiny compared to the probability that they are, in fact, attached to my left shoulder! (And for this I am thankful.)Similarly, The Grand Design finally clarified for me what a boson is. I just have these song lyrics stuck in my head:They suppose that particles have mass becauseThere is this Higgs field that extends through all spaceAnd some particles slow down while other particles raceStraight through like the photon — it has no massBut something heavy like the top quark, it’s draggin’ its ***And the Higgs is a boson that carries a forceAnd makes particles take orders from the field that is its source.If you haven’t already seen it, the Large Hadron Rap is one of the most amazing science raps I have ever seen, and it does an excellent job at explaining what scientists are trying to achieve using the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, I still wasn’t clear on this idea of bosons and force fields. Something about the way H&M explain bosons in The Grand Design finally made it click for me:… according to classical theories, forces are transmitted by fields. But in quantum ield theories the force fields are pictured as being made of various elementary particles called bosons, which are force-carrying particles that fly back and forth between matter particles, transmitting the forces.So the field and particle are dual concepts, one of which applies to classical theories (like relativity) while the other applies to quantum theory. Particles are the language of quantum mechanics, and so force fields have been replaced by a particle that conveys each force: photons for electromagnetism, gluons for the strong force, W and Z bosons for the weak force, and perhaps gravitons for gravity (we haven’t found them yet!). That’s really cool, and I am glad H&M cleared that up for me. This is why I read so many books that cover the same scientific concepts, even similar books by one author: each different method of explaining a concept aids my understanding in some small way.This kind of incremental learning is present in science as well. H&M mention, “Modern technology is sensitive enough to allow us to perform many sensitive tests of general relativity, and it has passed every one”. That relativity is testable and falsifiable—and, correspondingly, has passed all of the tests we have thus far devised—lends great credence to its accuracy as a scientific model. There are, of course, more subtle questions about the roles of testability and falsification play in judging a scientific theory (e.g.: Evolution is arguably not testable, nor is string theory.) What’s important is that H&M emphasize that science is not some kind of mysterious black box where we plug in data in order to obtain inviolable laws of nature. So that’s why I’m fine with people criticizing, say, evolution, because all science should be open to criticism—but the moment that criticism rests on an objection like “it’s only a ‘theory’!” I will stop listening. Our scientific principles are theories because science is self-correcting and constantly improving upon and revising those principles. That is why science is so powerful, so important, and so very cool.By far the most mind-boggling concept in The Grand Design comes at the end, and it is the exception to my earlier remark that I find the first part of the book the heaviest in terms of mental exertion. The ultimate thesis of this book is that we can explain the origin of the universe without invoking a creator deity, a God. I think it is very important to note that H&M are not saying that science can disprove the existence of God, nor is that an objective of The Grand Design. While it is clear that H&M, like myself, do not believe a God exists, this is not their argument. Instead, they are merely removing the necessity of God’s existence. I can see how one can misinterpret the book—hence my initial comments about the disconnect and design flaw. H&M’s scepticism is vividly demonstrated, and they raise some of the problems with attempting to fit God into cosmogony—namely, if God created the universe, who created God? If the answer is that “God is eternal and has always been here,” then why can’t we just replace “God” with “the universe” and leave it at that?This might seem impossible, for we know the universe is not eternal in that sense: we can measure its age (with some degree of precision), and it’s only 13.7 billion years old! Moreover, we know that the universe will eventually reach some sort of end, whether it is heat death, a Big Crunch, etc. H&M resolve this, and that unfortunate singularity at the origin of the universe that prevents our physics from explaining anything, by saying:In the early universe—when the universe was small enough to be governed by both general relativity and quantum theory—there were effectively four dimensions of space and none of time. That means that when we speak of the “beginning” of the universe, we are skirting the subtle issue that as we look backward toward the very early universe, time as we know it does not exist! We must accept that our usual ideas of space and time do not apply to the very early universe.Read that twice: asking what happened “before” the universe existed is meaningless, because time itself did not exist as we regard it today. If that sounds too strange and too incredible to accept, believe me: you are certainly not alone. Much like my experience with bosons, I am only now, after confronting this several times, beginning to wrap my head around this explanation. We are just so obsessed with our view of linear time that thinking of a universe where time functions differently boggles our intuition. It is definitely the most difficult concept H&M present in this book, and as with some of their other explanations, I do not think they entirely succeed in presenting it the way they probably hoped.The Grand Design is ambitious. It is also brief and conversational, as physics books go, and at times this runs up against that ambition. As someone who loves the philosophy of science, loves physics, and has read quite a lot of books about physics, I enjoyed The Grand Design and found it enlightening. Although I recommend it to others with less experience, because it really is a very accessible book, I do so with one reservation: if this is your first physics book, don’t let it be your last. There are so many good ones out there, and while The Grand Design is a fine place to start, it is not the last word on the theory of everything.

118,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120477-jacob,3,"I've read snippets of Hawking's books before and enjoyed them. The particular theme of this one interested me so I picked it up. It started out with some creation myths and a well-paced history of bigger picture science. It bogged down in the middle with an exploration of quantam physics that the author felt was necessary for his subsequent theory of Grand Design, but in reality did little for his theory or the book as a whole.In fact, while engaging, fun to read, and highly informative, the book falls flat at the end. The line of reasoning, from my perspective, leaves much to be desired. Consider a few quotes from the last chapter:""It is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, the the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. In this view it is accepted that some entity exists that needs no creator, and that entity is called God. We claim, however, that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings""While I find the philosophical question of who created God, highly intriguing, I think Mr. Hawking confuses the fact that we are constantly finding laws that govern existence, thereby explaining what we thought was only attributable to divine interference as proof that the divine does not exist. Take this next quote:""Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.""Really? Is it any less plausible that the universe just started randomly 13 billion years ago than a supreme being created it? Either line of thought requires a good amount of faith to believe in. It reminds me of C.S. Lewis' arguments for the existence of God and how they all fell short if you did not start from the premise of belief in something more than the random universe--ultimately you have to believe one way or the other and no amount of ""proof"" will stand up to scrutiny because there is simply too much we don't know.Regarding the Grand Design itself:""M-theory is the UNIFIED [caps mine] theory Einstein was hoping to find. The fact that we human beings-who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature-have been able to come this close to understanding of the laws governing us and our universe is a great triumph...If the theory is confirmed by observation, it will be the successful conclusion of a search going back more than 3000 years. We will have found the grand design.""This is from the last paragraph in the book. The problem is that there is nothing unified about M-theory. Hawking states this in his opening chapter and we learn later in the book that M-theory takes into account electromagnetism, strong forces, weak forces, and string theory in order to produce a multi-verse version of reality that includes 10 to the 500th power possibilities. Not only is this pretty far from fathomable to the average man, but it violates his first two principle of a good model from chapter 3, ""A model is a good model if it: 1. Is elegant 2. Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements"". A convoluted mish-mash of theories that produces so many various elements (mathematically computable or not) is hardly a ""good model"". Due to the sheer volume of calculations necessary it is hard to confirm fulfillment of the last two criteria that the good model: ""3. Agrees with and explains all existing observations 4. Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can disprove or falsify the model if they are not borne out.""Don't get me wrong. I am no quantam physicist nor cosmologist and certainly don't have the knowledge to disprove any theories in these fields. Likely we are on the right track with something like M-theory. However, it is not an easily understood unified theory (such may not even exist), and it certainly doesn't provide any answers about the why of the universe as it claims to. As with much of both science and religion, the more we learn and understand, the more questions arise.The poor finishing premises of this book and agonizingly thick explanations in the middle of this work, knock it down two notches, but it is still worth the read if this sort of thing interests you. Solid 3 stars."
119,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1917722-chy,4,"Since I read this here book, I’m going to attempt to talk like a smart person. It’s a half-hearted attempt and is doomed to failure, as hopefully you realize it already done did.“There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.”(Douglas Adams)This book totally agrees with that, in the end. I have this book because my sixteen-year-old stepson had to buy it for a class he was going to take, and then decided not to take the class. Perhaps that’s why I so strongly perceive it as written toward a “younger” audience. But, as with a lot of things written by very intelligent people toward an audience they knew to be dumber than they are, there are a lot of jokes that sort of insult your intelligence without really meaning to. You know, the kind of jokes that make teenagers really roll their eyes, which is especially bad when they’re in there to try to “relate to” the very people who roll their eyes at it.In talking about the Stoics describing “physical processes in legal terms and [believing] them to be in need of enforcement, even though the objects required to ‘obey’ the laws were inanimate”: “If you think it is hard to get humans to follow traffic laws, imagine convincing an asteroid to move along an ellipse.”It tends to be distracting and awkward and tacked-in-there. And it’s not needed; the book’s written in simple language, and it’s exceedingly easy to read, which makes it easy to be interested in it so long as one has at least a little interest in the subject anyway--which is not something these jokes would induce in any case. Still, it wasn’t enough to really degrade my opinion of the book.I did get a little frustrated with the over-simplification of things here and there, because so many times that kind of thing leaves out the explanations I come into this kind of thing looking for. And when I get all frustrated like that, I miss things, which was my main problem in college. The teachers tend to want to get to this point or that point and spit out some model along the way that I’d really like to dwell on, but their explanation is, “It exists because we need it for the equation all of us are on now so come on, come on.”I don’t even like to think about how long it took me to finally figure out where π came from and why we use it, and how frustrated I was with teachers who kept telling me, “Just feed your numbers into the formula and give the damn answer.”But I only hit that wall, really, there in the middle. The thing I found most useful about the book was the scientific history lessons. Reminders of when people like Newton and Aristotle lived, and just what they came up with---before we modified and reworded it. That was my favorite aspect of the book by far.My other favorite thing was the introduction to John Conway’s Game of Life. And I can’t believe I’ve never run across it before. How completely and utterly baffling, to me, that I never have. (Or maybe I have and it was just never presented in such a memorable way?) You can even download it and play with it as a “game”: http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/I’m not sure either of those links can show at all why I love the implications so much (because I haven’t actually read through those sites), but to explain I have to plagiarize pages of this book, so I’ll leave it be. And maybe call a buddy to see if he can download Life for me. Heh."
120,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,4,"It's a funny thing being a cosmologist in the greater Los Angeles area. Back when I was a partying single graduate student, I'd frequently hit the town for some fun. Inevitably I'd meet someone, strike up a conversation, and they might ask me what I did for a living.""Oh, I'm a cosmologist."" ""Cosmetologist? Cool, do you do make-up for movies?"" ""Um...not unless rouge is a component of dark matter."" (ba-da-bum)""...""""I make detectors and use them to study the origins and geometry of our universe."" ""Uh. No way. You ever work in movies?""I discovered after a few years of this that it was much easier and simpler to tell people I was Mary Poppins at Disneyland. Without exception, folks believed me, made a joke and moved on. The physics thing just cause wrinkled faces, and very odd non-sequiturs. Once I had a guy tell me all about a distant cousin who studied shrimp in the Netherlands. Frequently I'd get the physicist = physician mix-up. Luckily no one ever showed me their rash. Oh well, such is the life of the lonely, misunderstood cosmologist.Why am I telling you about all my misadventures in life? Oh yeah, to let you know that my background is observational cosmology. (I.e. making devices, detectors, instruments and doing experiments in labs, in Antarctica and on space-born projects.) I'm not a theorist, and most definitely not into string theory/membrane theory/M-theory. That stuff isn't even touched upon in most graduate programs. It's esoteric, wicked complicated, and honestly still in a very nascent stage.So, I'm not qualified to comment on M-theory being THE answer to The Grand Design as Hawking and Mlodinow so insistently propose. The question then becomes did they sell me on the idea. I dunno... maybe? It was all so very glossed over, overwhelmed by all the history and background needed to give the reader an appropriate framework. Then when they finally game to the climax of the story, where all the previous information should coalesce, M-theory barely got much of an explanation or treatment at all.I got the impression they wanted to push this Grand Idea, a wrap-up of all previous ideas, made with sweeping statements and generalizations to get press. Plus, if it turns out to work and be right, they can point to this very thin book and say ""A-ha!"" That's why I removed a star.Now, if you are looking to learn more about the science of the universe this is just the book for you. They do an excellent job explaining aspects of special relativity, general relativity, particle physics, early-universe physics, even my favorite field, the CMB. (Which maddeningly they call the CMBR, a very outdated term, and refer to the fluctuations as being in the microwave regime, even though they are sub-millimeter radiation! Grrr!) They even throw in a ton of historical context, which helps the reader understand the difficulties of the field and the constantly evolving nature of science.The science is great, you will learn a ton. Really. The writing is clear in that no-nonsense style Hawking is so famous for. Unfortunately in a few areas the explanations get really muddled to the point of incomprehensibility, and I suspect that might be Mlodinow's doing, since those muddled spots fall in his particular area of expertise. One would expect a research scientist in the field (even if she's a lowly experimentalist) should be able to breeze through all their scientific lessons. I found the string theory section to be really tough-going, with pretty poorly thought out examples. But it is a very esoteric field, and maybe there just aren't easy ways to help lay-folks visualize the 11-dimensional space and the vibrating membranes?Speaking of clear teaching examples, the book is filled with ways to help the reader visualize some very hard concepts. Gravity affects space-time like having a rubber sheet for your pool table, then pulling down on one spot right in the middle. The balls will curve around the area in much the same way that objects do near-ish black holes. The ""strings"" in string theory are described to be like a straw, with a surface space, but curled up on itself. However, from very far away a straw looks like a 2-dimensional line.And yet a few of their examples obviously fall short, which I suppose all stand-ins for the real thing will eventually do. The one that really stood out like a a sore thumb was the balloon-as-expanding-universe. Their illustration looks like someone could take a marker and draw little galaxies on a balloon. Then as the balloon is filled with more air and expands, all galaxies will move away from each other independently. The first trouble is that the galaxies, if drawn on, would expand themselves, which doesn't actually happen. (The mass and hence gravity of galaxies is a stronger force than the expansion of the universe.) In the text, it's made clear that the galaxies have to be treated as points on the balloon, but the graphic is a bit misleading. Secondly, the obvious question to the balloon is: Okay, the balloon expands into our 3-dimensional space, so what is the universe expanding into? They certainly touch on the answer later, but never refer back to our balloon. What a shame.At any rate, here's my advice: Believe their grand M-theory answer or don't, I don't think it matters as long as you have learned a few things about our scientific understanding of the universe along the way.Since I made fun of ""The Industry"" suitors I encountered around Los Angeles, I should relate a tale of the foolish physicists. Create a supersymmetry of courtship mishaps or something. I was at a party on campus, which was completely populated by science grad students, and maybe a few random stray people. I met a guy, he seemed nice enough, so we chatted about motorcycles for a while. He asked me what I studied, so I very jokingly told him I was a Theoretical Cosmetologist, and a student at the neighboring university (which has many, many more women). Ridiculous, right? The guy fell for it hook, line and sinker, and wanted to know more details of this theoretical cosmetology. So I told him all about color theory, combining it with an understanding of personality traits, and the effect of shadowing on first-impressions. Meanwhile, my co-workers stood behind him, trying to hold in their laughter. It was mean, but he believed me! If you ever meet me in person, only believe about 63% of what I say. The rest is a joke. And that's a scientifically proven fact."
121,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"When this book was released, I was reading a story about it on-line, and the headline said something like: “Stephen Hawking Says There Is No God”. Then I made the critical mistake of looking at the user comments under the story. It was the usual collection of badly spelled notes from ignorant asshats who tried to say that stupid science didn’t know nuthin’ or that it was all Obama’s fault. But one in particular caught my eye. It was by someone who undoubtedly dabbles in both neurosurgery and rocket science in his-or-her spare time, and it said something along the lines of: “THAT”S WHYY STEVN HAWKENS IS IN WHEEELCHAR!!!!!! BCAUSE HE DON”T BELIVE IN GOD!! JEBUS IS PUNSINGHING HIM!!!”Which got me thinking about why anyone would expect a guy who has suffered from ALS and been confined to a wheelchair for most of his life to believe in God? Among the many people who have just cause to question that a loving God is waiting in heaven to dish them out a heaping plate of Sky Cake, I’d think that Stephen Hawking would be one of them.It’s that kind of thinking that Hawking and Mlodinow take on here. Some people will point out the odds against any kind of life existing on Earth and say that God must have set it all in motion and made this place just for us and that it’s proof of an intelligent creator. Or you listen to a scientist like Hawking who points out that there’s whole multiverses where life doesn’t exist and that the only reason we know how lucky we are is that we exist to appreciate how lucky we are. Basing the idea that there must be some kind of intelligent creator simply because we’re here is bad science.And that’s Hawking’s point. This isn’t an anti-God book, it’s a pro-science and pro-critical thinking book. Hawking does a nice job in the early chapters of giving a brief overview of the development of the scientific method and how beliefs in mysterious beings have been incorporated into theories and then debunked over the centuries. Then he lays out the flaws in the models that insist that there has to be some kind of creator being in the mix. Even though Hawking does his best to dumb down the quantum physics that he claims proves his point and provides lots of handy pictures and graphics to help out the math and science challenged like me, it’s not exactly light reading. It’s short at 181 pages, and that helps, but while I’m fascinated by this kind of stuff, I’m also stupid enough that I had to read over some sections a couple of times before I thought I had a handle on it.It’s enlightening and a nice overview of both the scientific method and quantum physics, but unfortunately, I can’t see any of the people who should read this actually picking it up.

Stephen Hawking is smarter than I am. That's no big feat because two of my cats are smarter than I am. The other cat is a certifiable idiot. But Hawking is way smarter than I am. The Grand Design is Hawking's explanation, more or less, about why the universe is the way it is. The answer comes down to M-theory which is more of a combining of explanations than one single unifying theory. Many reviewers seem to think Hawking is saying there is no God but he really seems to be stating that God is irrelevant. The real question is did we come from something or nothing. The beginning of an answer involves an understanding of quantum physics and multiverses that Hawking put as well into laymen's term as we can hope for. I don't pretend to understand everything in this book. I'm still contemplating why the world needs hairballs. But I did immensely enjoy reading this short book and can honestly say I understand a little bit more."

More than half were written by the very professors that were teaching me. Quite frankly, it's a giant scam. Those professors have already been paid for the first material through their salaries. Why should we have to pay them again for copies of their pretty badly written books? Yes, these books are very expensive, and many don't deserve to be read.

128,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"I have a feeling that the publishing industry is milking Stephen Hawking. There was a time when we had a dashing physicist named Richard Feynman who used LSD and played banjo in a strip club. The naked pole dancers didn’t distract him from formulating quantum electrodynamics. He was quite a genius, and he was all over the place with his talks and popular books. But he’s dead. Now Stephen Hawking seems to be the coolest physicist around. He’s paralyzed and wheelchair-bound, and he speaks through a voice synthesizer by twitching a tiny working cheek muscle against a screen to pick up a displayed word. How cool is that! So he’s become quite a celebrity, and he fully deserves it. The public is fascinated with him. But that doesn’t mean a whole lot for the quality of his books. I’ve read better pop-physics books than this one. Besides, I didn’t see anything new here. This book got more publicity because it’s supposed to take on the question of God. It’s no secret that the great biologists and physicists tend to be atheists. That’s a very telling fact. But having acknowledged that, I don’t see a point in a physicist trying to “disprove” God through physics. Upon being asked by Napoleon where God fits in his physics, Laplace is reported to having said: “Sire, I have not needed that hypothesis.” Science, by definition, does not and cannot use the God hypothesis. I don’t see why it should get into the business of rejecting that hypothesis. Those who are inclined to reject God can point to the findings of biology and cosmology for support. But that is quite different from a physicist setting out to refute God based on physics. As for the God-rejecting physics – it can be summarized in two points: 1) While no individual physical object can appear out of nothing, an entire universe can. This is because the sum-total of the energy in the universe is zero. 2) There are almost an infinite number of universes popping out of nothing into existence. One of them, like the one where we live, can, by mere chance, have the right properties (laws and constants of physics) for the emergence of starts and planets and eventually life. The book goes into explaining the physics behind these two claims. Unless you’re a physicist as good as Hawking, there’s nothing you can say about his physics. "
129,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5973308-david-boyce,2,"As a cosmologist and a Stephen Hawking fan, I have a real issue with this book. His statement, that the Universe unpacks itself and therefore does not need a creator is based on some really flawed logic called 'model dependent realism'. MDR is a way of comparing reality to a model, if the model produces the same observable characteristics as observed in reality then the model is said to be as true as any other model.Imagine this, if there was equal amounts of incriminating evidence that two people committed a crime and prosecution lawyers could build a case against both men then under MDR both are guilty of the crime irrespective of the fact that it only happened one way. By invoking MDR Hawking is blatantly ignoring the lessons of the past, that evidence makes or breaks models, and so far M-theory is unsupported by evidence.In fact if you follow the line of Hawking's logic, rather than his conclusion, you can even say that Hawking categorically proves the existence of God - All be it as an MDR model of Universe creation. However he selectively ignores this and only looks at how MDR supports his religious beliefs. But, there are a lot of things wrong with this book. Let me explain....Hawking contradicts himself. He says that Kepler, Galileo, Descartes and Newton saw that the laws of physics were the work of God and that this God was not the God the Old Testament. However we do not have enough written down about the religious beliefs off all of the above to know that this is true and this statement is certainly not true for Newton who was as Christian as you could get. Hawking is doing something quite unscientific here, he is trying to re-write history. It is an embarrassment to atheism that some of the greatest geniuses off all time could have a religious belief like the rest of us and so Hawking is trying to apologise for this by making out that somehow the religious beliefs of these scientists were different to that of the rest of the population.Hawking suggests at some points that we must take the Universe at face value, that we must consider real only what is measurably real and then contradicts himself (when talking about the holographic theory) by saying that the Universe may be fundamentally different to how we observe it.Hawking suggests that God doesn’t intervene, and defines intervening as a suspension of the normal laws of physics. But what about intervention using the laws of physics. What about a God that intervenes only rarely. Under MDR all are as real as a God that never intervenes. Hawking laughs at the idea that we might all be the figment of someone else’s dream, but under the logic he himself invokes, this theory is as real as M-theory.Hawking describes how our perception of reality can be changed by placing upside down glasses on our faces. Our minds are so set in their ways that they refuse the new reality and change the input to fit with the model of the reality in our heads. In MDR the model each person has in their heads is a real reality. Reality is unique to each observer. If God exists in my model, it is true for my Universe, if he doesn’t in yours then God really is absent from yours.Hawking describes how St Augustine concluded that the Earth was young due to the ages of people in the bible, but at the time there was no recognised evidence to suggest otherwise. According to MDR young Earth creationism was the reality, since no other model existed. He says that young Earth creationism in the present day is as real as the big bang theory. But Hawking is breaking his own logic here. In today’s day and age we have a lot more evidence that the Universe began with something like the big bang which means that under MDR, this model is considered to be MORE real.Hawking describes how Hubble’s model of the Universe was accepted because it was the most natural model but naturalness and elegance is purely subjective. In MDR plausibility is not measured. Hawking mentions how the laws of nature determine a range of probabilities of various futures and past, and yet avoids the issue about how a selection is made. Somehow a selection IS made.Hawking describes how the Universe is comprehensible because it can be modelled. This is not true. Only the model is comprehensible. The Universe is not the model; the Universe is infinite and by its very nature incomprehensible and thanks to quantum physics not even entirely measurable.The bits that really make me cringe, and I have a degree and a PhD in this, is where Hawking gets his science wrong. Hawking suggests that the standard model “agrees with all current evidence”, but this is not true. Experiments have observed that the neutrino has mass, and the standard model cannot account for this.Hawking suggests that inflation in the early Universe really did happen, but recent observations by his old friend Roger Penrose have cast serious doubts over this. Hawking also suggests that this Universe is casually disconnected from the other possibilities, and so what we experience is just one possibility. However M-theory suggests that gravity information leaks between membranes, thus collapsing the universe into one possibility. This one.Hawking suggests the Universe has 4 dimensions of space time as the result of our selection. In his words the Universe is like this because this is one of the possibilities it could have been and our selection is this. But as Einstein said, “God doesn’t play dice”. To suggest that some thing’s have no fundamental reason for existing is like saying “Everybody stop all scientific research, because there is no fundamental reason for any of this”.Hawking also suggests that the act of creation is understandable purely within the realm of science, but doesn’t mention that we have no science that works at t=0. The science goof that nearly had me eating my kindle in apoplexy was when Hawking suggests that black holes have positive gravitational potential energy. If that were true, the milky way would be spread around the Universe. Hawking does do well at talking his way out of the fine tuning argument. He effectively kills that argument dead and I agree we do not need God to explain why the Universe is perfect for our existence. But my reply is that, people shouldn’t have been using that line of apologism in the first place because it doesn’t make theological sense, let alone scientific sense. According to Christian doctrine God made creation for himself, he did not make it for us.Hawking does well at explaining how quantum mechanics and relativity on intermediate scales produce Newtonian like physics. This is the Hawking we know and love and this book should have been full of this kind of stuff. Instead it is full of laughable pseudoscience and theology. Model dependent realism is not robust enough for Hawking’s confidence in it and doesn’t hold up to scrutiny or close inspection.The theological work in this is very much of the style of Dawkins and others who successfully disprove Gods of their own imagining. They create a God, give it powers and then disprove the God that they have created. But they don’t get anywhere near the God that people worship in churches. Hawking’s intellect outstrips his own imagination and it really shows in this work. I am very happily the other way around."

01.11.2016: Stephen Hawking warns that the Higgs Boson field could collapse, resulting in a chain reaction that would take in the whole universe with it.
 The nihilists have been right all along...M-theory: Doubts linger over godless multiverseSTEPHEN HAWKING'S new book The Grand Design sparked a furore over whether physics can be used to disprove the existence of God. But few have noted that the idea at the core of the book, M-theory, is the subject of an ongoing scientific debate – specifically over the very aspect of the theory that might scrap the need for a divine creator.That the laws of nature in our universe are finely tuned for life seems miraculous, leading some to invoke divine involvement. But if there is a multiverse out there – a multitude of universes, each with its own laws of physics – then the conditions we observe may not be unique.Source"

On the flip side, I had several light bulb moments, which is always nice.Among other things, Hawking makes a few great points particularly about the essence of ""reality.""And this passage below, which touches on free will, intrigued me.How can one tell if a being has free will? If one encounters an alien, how can one tell if it is just a robot or it has a mind of its own? The behavior of a robot would be completely determined, unlike that of a being with free will. Thus one could in principle detect a robot as a being whose actions can be predicted. As we said in Chapter 2, this may be impossibly difficult if the being is large and complex. We cannot even solve exactly the equations for three or more particles interacting with each other. Since an alien the size of a human would contain about a thousand trillion trillion particles even if the alien were a robot, it would be impossible to solve the equations and predict what it would do. We would therefore have to say that any complex being has free will--not as a fundamental feature, but as an effective theory, an admission of our inability to do the calculation that would enable us to predict its actions.So basically free will is an illusion, but given our inability to tease out all the complex biological processes that contribute to behavior, it is a good working theory for practical purposes. Thought this was an interesting way of looking at it.Worthy book, well written, and as good an attempt as any to simplify some very complex topics."

Despite my rudimentary understanding of quantum physics, I still gleaned a great deal from this book and would recommend it to anyone who is even mildly curious. Those who have a more advanced education in physics may find this book too basic, especially the earlier chapters.Questions such as ""What occurred before the big bang?"" and ""what instigated the creation of the universe?"" are addressed in the last chapter, and the earlier chapters build up a nice base of prior research for those unfamiliar with m-theory.

As is the case with most such gifts, I began to read it immediately.I was almost immediately turned off by the text owing to an extraordinary display of ignorance on the part of the authors and the editors, a mistake appearing in the first few pages in their lead-up to what is supposed to be a survey of the history of physics as germinated in Ionian philosophy. Here they note in passing that writing was first employed around 7000 BCE. In fact, so far as we've evidence, writing first appeared about 6000 years ago, in Sumer in approximately 4000 BCE.To make matters worse the authors go on glibly to dismiss philosophy as defunct--not too surprising as their review of it doesn't display much familiarity with the discipline.Beyond this, I found the jokes peppering this slim volume condescending yet sophomoric, unfunny and far too frequent.As regards the physics, I'm hardly qualified the judge, lacking as I do the background in mathematics and research physics to evaluate their positions. However, as someone with some background in philosophy and in the history of science, I find nothing original in their M theory business, such contextualization being rather old hat.There are many fine books written for generalists which attempt to explain modern cosmology and microphysics.

Are you worried you won't understand science because it's dense and dry and has diagrams instead of pictures? This is the book for you, then -- short, succinct, full-colour, and most importantly: clearly explained. The concepts here are intense and heady, but Hawking (and Mlodinow) write about them in a way you can actually understand. The mathematics are lacking, so this is definitely pop-science (and when I tried to explain an experiment referenced to a friend, I realized I wasn't completely sure when or who had conducted it, so..a bibliography would have been nice?). It's like a cosmology buffet: chronologically organized, mostly, from mythology to M-theory, with a sampling of the ideas therein.

137,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9512361-andrew-langridge,1,"There are only a couple of positives that I can think to say about this book. Firstly, Hawking has some Feynman-like qualities in being able to lucidly express important ideas in physics such as time dilation in special relativity and the double slit experiment. Secondly, his philosophy of science that he calls model-based realism has many things going for it, although why it is called realism is never fully explained. I did not find this book particularly easy to read, probably because I did not believe from the outset that I was going to be enlightened about our origins.Hawking states ""Philosophy is dead"", but scientists should be especially circumspect when trying to extrapolate their ideas into the humanities. Contemporary readers are still able to detect an elusive thread of truth running through all great philosophical works, and that, like the great works of art, they certainly have not been superseded by developments in science. Scientists meddling in the humanities often give the impression of never having studied the subjects they are criticising and tend to make 'straw man' arguments. The question 'why are we here?' is supposedly solved by science, but is of much more profound significance than Hawking credits. We feel our lives to have value as well as function and our desire throughout history to find life meaningful cannot be dismissed as lacking any significance. 'Is there a creator?' I have no particular axe to grind in favour of religion, but Hawking hypocritically rehashes ancient philosophical arguments for the non-existence of God, such as ""who created God?"". Moreover, religions cannot be treated simply as ontologies devoid of all the mythical elements that have inspired some of the greatest products of art and civilisation. Indeed, Weber tells us that science itself was given impetus by Protestantism.Hawking spends a long time discussing 'anthropic' arguments, but I don't understand their significance. It is only strange that the universe has these particular values for the universal constants or that the Earth's orbit has this narrow range of orbital parameters leading to the evolution of humanity if you have some reference point outside the universe to assess it from. We are doing science from the perspective of the human race as we are here and now, so of course the universe appears to us to be evolved to suit us, otherwise we would not be here to do the science. Hawking advances M Theory as the key to explaining the universe. I am not sufficiently qualified to give an opinion on this, but one thing it seems possible to say is that 'multiverse' theories are unique in science not only for never having been tested but also for being impossible to test. A far-fetched theory for why the dinosaurs died out at least has the possibility of being tested against palaeontological evidence. Any notions we entertain to make the concept of causality apply beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause. I agree with Pliny (ancient wisdom that Hawking dismisses) who states the impossibility of measuring the universe or understanding how it arose. To me, 'universe' by definition means everything that exists, so how can there be any reference point outside it from which to measure it? Cosmological physics turns out paradoxes by the dozen. If the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into? What caused the big bang? If we need mathematics to explain this, what makes us so sure we can rely on mathematics? And what about reasoning itself? What is truth? Oh darn it - another philosophical question!"
138,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1777325-julia,3,"I own several of Hawking's books, and so I was drawn to this thin volume. Obviously his co-author did most of the work, since Hawking's health continues to deteriorate. Mlodinow is a physicist at Caltech and an author in his own right. His name should appear as co-author, but my cynical brain thinks the publisher felt Hawking's name would sell more copies.Much time is given to Richard Feynman and his work in quantum physics. In fact, this book promotes the study of quantum theory as the main answer to human questions about existence. The book does a decent job of tracing the historical ways in which humans tried to comprehend the universe, but it does so in an egotistical way that bothers me. The very first page says ""philosophy is dead"" and advocates science as the only TRUE way to approach the deep human questions about the universe and our place in it.While I do hold science as the basis of my belief system, I'm just a bit concerned that Hawking put his name to a book that occasionally ""sniggers"" at the ides of earlier thinkers. Just because Ptolomy's design of the universe has been proven wrong should not denigrate the desire of his mind to understand the universe.So while I found some of the ideas interesting, WHOEVER really wrote this book comes across as rather egotistical. The sections on quantum theory are very complex, and I had to skip over some of the more esoteric parts.I've always found Hawking's books to be centered on his fascination with understanding this universe. In none of them did I ever find the condescention that is part of this book, and that's a danger for a scientist. Humility should be as important to a scientist as to a philosopher--Socrates knew that when he said he realized the Oracle of Delphi had claimed he was the wisest man in the world. He realized he WAS the wisest man only when he came to his famous conclusion that he ""knew nothing"". This book needed that humility lesson."

For example, here he tries to refute that a creator is required:""If the total energy of the universe must always remain zero, and it costs energy to create a body, how can a whole universe be created from nothing? That is why there must be a law like gravity. Because gravity is attractive, gravitational energy is negative: one has to do work to separate a gravitationally bound system... black holes have positive energy [and they balance out the negative energy]. That's why empty space is stable. [that is, a body cannot appear in empty space.] Bodies such as stars or black holes cannot just appear out of nothing. But a whole universe can.Because gravity shapes space and time, it allows space-time to be locally stable but globally unstable. On the scale of the entire universe, the positive energy of the matter can be balanced by the negative gravitational enerby, and so there is no restriction on the creation of whole universes."" (p.180) Nevertheless, it's difficult to find a book of this length that does a better job at explaining some pretty mind-blowing concepts."
142,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"Ever since I was little, I remember the image of Stephen Hawking from TV. I don't know why, but he remained embroidered in my brain after watching a TV show that spoke of him. This must have been 10 years ago, or something like that, but when it was explained to me what he was and what he was doing and did and why he looked the way he looked (remember I was 7 or 8 so I was bound to ask hurtful questions), I became to develop this fondness towards him. In my late years (oh, I'm soooo old), when I was 15 or something like that I started searching information about his work. Now, we have to be clear on one point. I do not, never did and probably (though hopefully not) never will understand physics. It has always been beyond my grasp and I sucked ass at it both at school and at home. Physics for me has to be explained in words and verbal theories. When you lay formulas on a paper, you lost me. And I mean really lost me. This bad understanding of mine is somewhat minimized by the fact that once I understood and learned something, I will never forget it. My memory is really good, and I'm proud to say I've learned a bit of physics both in school and outside of it, just by having it explained over and over again by patient friends that took their time with me. Now, when it comes to anything more complex than normal, simple, high school physics, you lost me again. Quantum physics is something that is absolutely and completely beyond my grasp. Still, in this little book of his, Stephen Hawking managed to explain some things to me, not just me but all of us who read the book. And after finishing it, I felt like I kinda/sorta understood them. Now I know that Stephen Hawking himself isn't able to ""write"" a book. But I've been doing my research and I found out some amazing things about him. The way he pours his thoughts on a paper is by help of his assistant, who sits next to him and asks him simple questions like ""what word are you searching for?"". Then he goes on to trials ""reassuring? reassured? reassure?"". Whenever Hawking agrees to a word, he slightly blinks. Whenever he doesn't, he grins. This is painstaking work. It's horribly slow and you have to be incredibly patient in order to do that. It's monumental work, really, and it deserves respect. Another thing I found out about Stephen Hawking that really impressed me was the fact that when he realized he wouldn't be able to write on a paper and make written calculations of his theories, he developed, inside his mind, a way of ""looking at the universe"". Put simply, there's 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D. We people see 3D. Hawking has developed a means through which he sees, or better imagines in 4D, the dimension that includes time. Isn't that awesome?! I've barely learned to read and write in my whole life! Anyways. I feel like I turned this review into an essay about how great Hawking is. Oh well. Read the book. Read his other books.

The book gives a good answer to the so-called ""anthropic principle""--namely, that the laws of physics and the fundamental constants appear to be perfectly tuned to allow our world, life, and humans to develop. If any of the laws or fundamental constants were to deviate even slightly, life might not be even possible.The answer to this dilemma, the authors state, is not that God created the laws of physics, and the answer is not that, by some fantastic coincidence, the laws of physics just happen to be perfect. Instead, an infinite number of universes have been created, each with its own unique set of laws. The book is interesting, but seems to fall down in the last chapter, titled, The Grand Design. In the last chapter, the authors argue that M-Theory is the only candidate theory that explains the universe--but that it has not yet been verified by observation. In fact, the authors state that M-Theory has not yet been fully developed; only some characteristics of the theory have been described.

These fields help us understand the universe, that crazy thing that’s all around us, and the fact that we have come so far is simply amazing. In The Grand Design, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow reflect upon how physics achieves this understanding of the universe, with a particular emphasis on how physics can explain the origin of the universe in a way that removes the need for a deity (whom we’ll call God).Mlodinow gets his name on the cover, but this is clearly a Hawking book first and foremost. His name is bigger, and the inside of the dust jacket begins, “The first major work in nearly a decade by one of the world’s great thinkers…"" (emphasis mine). Sorry, Mlodinow! You’re a nice guy, but I guess you’re just not a “great thinker”. (Actually, although I think I’d heard of him before, this is the first time I have encountered one of his “his” books, and now I can go and mark down a bunch of his other books to read. But I should probably talk about this book now.)I shall hereafter refer to Hawking and Mlodinow as “H&M” because it tickles my fancy to fantasize that a clothing chain might write a book on physics.The Grand Design is certainly an engaging treatise, but it is also problematic. I had a lot of fun reading it, and although I have a lot of experience reading about science, I feel confident recommending it for people who might otherwise quirk an eyebrow and say, “Erm … science? I don’t know….” It’s a very short book; it’s extremely conversational in tone, with plenty of analogies; and there are no tests at the end. There are even pictures (albeit not very good ones)! By problematic I mean that, from my own reading and from what I have read of reviews here on Goodreads, H&M confront the role of physics vis-à-vis religion in a way that doesn’t lend itself to clarity and suasion. There seems to be a disconnect between the evidence they present (which is very good) and how they phrase or otherwise communicate the conclusions they draw. This results in an ambiguity that means people will often misinterpret those conclusions or dismiss them out of hand. The Grand Design, one might say, suffers from a grand design flaw.(I am so sorry for that last sentence.)I can give an example from the very first page of the book, which, by the way, begins not with a foreword, preface, or introduction, but Chapter 1. It’s true that this first chapter is very much an introductory chapter that lays the ground for the rest of the book, but I have to give H&M and their editors credit for not subjecting us to another scientist pontificating about these guys or a token preface. The conciseness of this book is appreciated, even if it leads to pithy statements like this:Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.As someone who unequivocally supports science as a way to discover and understand the universe, I must nevertheless shake my head at this passage. Taken literally, it seems like an unnecessarily harsh indictment of philosophy, particularly contemporary philosophy, which is very much alive. Even leaving aside philosophy that concerns itself with things other than those questions (such as “Who are we? Where did we come from?”), philosophers routinely discuss developments in science in their philosophy. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that most scientists also become philosophers—as you will see if you read this book, it is clear that H&M are. However, to be fair to them, I think that what H&M are trying to distinguish—albeit sensationally—is the difference between purely attempting to reason about our existence and our origins (rationalism) and using tools to collect data and make inferences about that existence and those origins (empiricism). The program founded in the Western world by Aristotle and raised onto a pedestal by the Enlightenment scientists has failed: we cannot know the world through reason alone. Bacon, Newton, Galileo, Franklin, etc., realized that we must experiment—we have to conduct tests that anyone with the appropriate knowledge and equipment can reproduce. So philosophy alone cannot take us the entire way, and science provides that next crucial step.If you haven’t read the book, and especially if you approach physics with more wariness than I do, you will find this very weird, but I found the first half of the book much heavier than the last half (with one notable exception). Following that incendiary introductory passage, H&M segue into a deep discussion of what science is, where it is coming from, and where it might be going. Specifically, they introduce a concept called model-dependent realism. And I think this is a fascinating, perhaps even peculiar decision on their part, because I doubt many of their readers would have ever heard of this term—whereas, in comparison, even most laypeople will have heard words like “quantum mechanics” and “general relativity”. H&M have great confidence in their audience, for they have faith that the audience will not be deterred when they drop some philosophy of science in the first chapter.It makes sense to talk about model-dependent realism, though, because it is relevant to M-theory, which is the group of theories that H&M discuss as a candidate for the ultimate “theory of everything”. And kudos to H&M for trying to pull back the curtain on the somewhat mystical way “theories” are constructed and viewed (at least by some scientists). In particular, I love the analogy they use with a map of the world: we can’t accurately transfer a three-dimensional sphere to a two-dimensional surface, so no matter what projection we use (e.g., Mercator, Robinson), it will always be distorted. So just as different projections provide different but useful models of our world, different theories provide different but useful models of the universe. Some of these theories have been collected under the name “M-theory”, and together they might be “the answer” when none of them alone could make the cut.Of course, I like model-dependent realism, because I am a realist, and as H&M say, it “short-circuits all this argument and discussion between the realist and anti-realist schools of thought”. I won’t go into realism versus anti-realism here; that is probably best left for a deeper discussion of the philosophy of science. Suffice it to say, science is not about establishing a single, fixed “truth” outlined by a single set of theories. As H&M point out, Ptolemy and Kepler’s model of a geocentric orbit using epicycles is as valid as our heliocentric model—one certainly can regard the rest of the solar system as “orbiting” the Earth. Yet the geocentric model is fiendishly complex and quickly becomes unwieldy if one ever wants to perform actual calculations; the heliocentric model has the advantage of being simpler and more elegant. So these are all thoughts that H&M want us to consider as they launch into an overview of the state of physics in the twenty-first century.I like that H&M go to the trouble of distinguishing between “probability” as we use the term colloquially and the role probability plays in quantum mechanics. Nancy Kress discusses probability in quantum mechanics at length in 
Probability Sun
, but she only alludes to the difference rather than explicates it. Quantum mechanics is weird and strange and revolutionary precisely because of one word: uncertainty. It blew away the classical world, particularly the deterministic aspect. That pesky Heisenberg uncertainty principle means we’ll never know exactly where a particle is and how fast it is moving. Hence, according to quantum mechanics, asking where a particle is is a meaningless question. Rather, ask what the probability is of a particle being in a particular point in space-time. There is a probability that all the particles in my left arm might actually be in Switzerland right now, but the probability is tiny compared to the probability that they are, in fact, attached to my left shoulder! (And for this I am thankful.)Similarly, The Grand Design finally clarified for me what a boson is. I just have these song lyrics stuck in my head:They suppose that particles have mass becauseThere is this Higgs field that extends through all spaceAnd some particles slow down while other particles raceStraight through like the photon — it has no massBut something heavy like the top quark, it’s draggin’ its ***And the Higgs is a boson that carries a forceAnd makes particles take orders from the field that is its source.If you haven’t already seen it, the Large Hadron Rap is one of the most amazing science raps I have ever seen, and it does an excellent job at explaining what scientists are trying to achieve using the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, I still wasn’t clear on this idea of bosons and force fields. Something about the way H&M explain bosons in The Grand Design finally made it click for me:… according to classical theories, forces are transmitted by fields. But in quantum ield theories the force fields are pictured as being made of various elementary particles called bosons, which are force-carrying particles that fly back and forth between matter particles, transmitting the forces.So the field and particle are dual concepts, one of which applies to classical theories (like relativity) while the other applies to quantum theory. Particles are the language of quantum mechanics, and so force fields have been replaced by a particle that conveys each force: photons for electromagnetism, gluons for the strong force, W and Z bosons for the weak force, and perhaps gravitons for gravity (we haven’t found them yet!). That’s really cool, and I am glad H&M cleared that up for me. This is why I read so many books that cover the same scientific concepts, even similar books by one author: each different method of explaining a concept aids my understanding in some small way.This kind of incremental learning is present in science as well. H&M mention, “Modern technology is sensitive enough to allow us to perform many sensitive tests of general relativity, and it has passed every one”. That relativity is testable and falsifiable—and, correspondingly, has passed all of the tests we have thus far devised—lends great credence to its accuracy as a scientific model. There are, of course, more subtle questions about the roles of testability and falsification play in judging a scientific theory (e.g.: Evolution is arguably not testable, nor is string theory.) What’s important is that H&M emphasize that science is not some kind of mysterious black box where we plug in data in order to obtain inviolable laws of nature. So that’s why I’m fine with people criticizing, say, evolution, because all science should be open to criticism—but the moment that criticism rests on an objection like “it’s only a ‘theory’!” I will stop listening. Our scientific principles are theories because science is self-correcting and constantly improving upon and revising those principles. That is why science is so powerful, so important, and so very cool.By far the most mind-boggling concept in The Grand Design comes at the end, and it is the exception to my earlier remark that I find the first part of the book the heaviest in terms of mental exertion. The ultimate thesis of this book is that we can explain the origin of the universe without invoking a creator deity, a God. I think it is very important to note that H&M are not saying that science can disprove the existence of God, nor is that an objective of The Grand Design. While it is clear that H&M, like myself, do not believe a God exists, this is not their argument. Instead, they are merely removing the necessity of God’s existence. I can see how one can misinterpret the book—hence my initial comments about the disconnect and design flaw. H&M’s scepticism is vividly demonstrated, and they raise some of the problems with attempting to fit God into cosmogony—namely, if God created the universe, who created God? If the answer is that “God is eternal and has always been here,” then why can’t we just replace “God” with “the universe” and leave it at that?This might seem impossible, for we know the universe is not eternal in that sense: we can measure its age (with some degree of precision), and it’s only 13.7 billion years old! Moreover, we know that the universe will eventually reach some sort of end, whether it is heat death, a Big Crunch, etc. H&M resolve this, and that unfortunate singularity at the origin of the universe that prevents our physics from explaining anything, by saying:In the early universe—when the universe was small enough to be governed by both general relativity and quantum theory—there were effectively four dimensions of space and none of time. That means that when we speak of the “beginning” of the universe, we are skirting the subtle issue that as we look backward toward the very early universe, time as we know it does not exist! We must accept that our usual ideas of space and time do not apply to the very early universe.Read that twice: asking what happened “before” the universe existed is meaningless, because time itself did not exist as we regard it today. If that sounds too strange and too incredible to accept, believe me: you are certainly not alone. Much like my experience with bosons, I am only now, after confronting this several times, beginning to wrap my head around this explanation. We are just so obsessed with our view of linear time that thinking of a universe where time functions differently boggles our intuition. It is definitely the most difficult concept H&M present in this book, and as with some of their other explanations, I do not think they entirely succeed in presenting it the way they probably hoped.The Grand Design is ambitious. It is also brief and conversational, as physics books go, and at times this runs up against that ambition. As someone who loves the philosophy of science, loves physics, and has read quite a lot of books about physics, I enjoyed The Grand Design and found it enlightening. Although I recommend it to others with less experience, because it really is a very accessible book, I do so with one reservation: if this is your first physics book, don’t let it be your last. There are so many good ones out there, and while The Grand Design is a fine place to start, it is not the last word on the theory of everything.

148,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120477-jacob,3,"I've read snippets of Hawking's books before and enjoyed them. The particular theme of this one interested me so I picked it up. It started out with some creation myths and a well-paced history of bigger picture science. It bogged down in the middle with an exploration of quantam physics that the author felt was necessary for his subsequent theory of Grand Design, but in reality did little for his theory or the book as a whole.In fact, while engaging, fun to read, and highly informative, the book falls flat at the end. The line of reasoning, from my perspective, leaves much to be desired. Consider a few quotes from the last chapter:""It is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, the the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. In this view it is accepted that some entity exists that needs no creator, and that entity is called God. We claim, however, that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings""While I find the philosophical question of who created God, highly intriguing, I think Mr. Hawking confuses the fact that we are constantly finding laws that govern existence, thereby explaining what we thought was only attributable to divine interference as proof that the divine does not exist. Take this next quote:""Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.""Really? Is it any less plausible that the universe just started randomly 13 billion years ago than a supreme being created it? Either line of thought requires a good amount of faith to believe in. It reminds me of C.S. Lewis' arguments for the existence of God and how they all fell short if you did not start from the premise of belief in something more than the random universe--ultimately you have to believe one way or the other and no amount of ""proof"" will stand up to scrutiny because there is simply too much we don't know.Regarding the Grand Design itself:""M-theory is the UNIFIED [caps mine] theory Einstein was hoping to find. The fact that we human beings-who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature-have been able to come this close to understanding of the laws governing us and our universe is a great triumph...If the theory is confirmed by observation, it will be the successful conclusion of a search going back more than 3000 years. We will have found the grand design.""This is from the last paragraph in the book. The problem is that there is nothing unified about M-theory. Hawking states this in his opening chapter and we learn later in the book that M-theory takes into account electromagnetism, strong forces, weak forces, and string theory in order to produce a multi-verse version of reality that includes 10 to the 500th power possibilities. Not only is this pretty far from fathomable to the average man, but it violates his first two principle of a good model from chapter 3, ""A model is a good model if it: 1. Is elegant 2. Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements"". A convoluted mish-mash of theories that produces so many various elements (mathematically computable or not) is hardly a ""good model"". Due to the sheer volume of calculations necessary it is hard to confirm fulfillment of the last two criteria that the good model: ""3. Agrees with and explains all existing observations 4. Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can disprove or falsify the model if they are not borne out.""Don't get me wrong. I am no quantam physicist nor cosmologist and certainly don't have the knowledge to disprove any theories in these fields. Likely we are on the right track with something like M-theory. However, it is not an easily understood unified theory (such may not even exist), and it certainly doesn't provide any answers about the why of the universe as it claims to. As with much of both science and religion, the more we learn and understand, the more questions arise.The poor finishing premises of this book and agonizingly thick explanations in the middle of this work, knock it down two notches, but it is still worth the read if this sort of thing interests you. Solid 3 stars."
149,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1917722-chy,4,"Since I read this here book, I’m going to attempt to talk like a smart person. It’s a half-hearted attempt and is doomed to failure, as hopefully you realize it already done did.“There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.”(Douglas Adams)This book totally agrees with that, in the end. I have this book because my sixteen-year-old stepson had to buy it for a class he was going to take, and then decided not to take the class. Perhaps that’s why I so strongly perceive it as written toward a “younger” audience. But, as with a lot of things written by very intelligent people toward an audience they knew to be dumber than they are, there are a lot of jokes that sort of insult your intelligence without really meaning to. You know, the kind of jokes that make teenagers really roll their eyes, which is especially bad when they’re in there to try to “relate to” the very people who roll their eyes at it.In talking about the Stoics describing “physical processes in legal terms and [believing] them to be in need of enforcement, even though the objects required to ‘obey’ the laws were inanimate”: “If you think it is hard to get humans to follow traffic laws, imagine convincing an asteroid to move along an ellipse.”It tends to be distracting and awkward and tacked-in-there. And it’s not needed; the book’s written in simple language, and it’s exceedingly easy to read, which makes it easy to be interested in it so long as one has at least a little interest in the subject anyway--which is not something these jokes would induce in any case. Still, it wasn’t enough to really degrade my opinion of the book.I did get a little frustrated with the over-simplification of things here and there, because so many times that kind of thing leaves out the explanations I come into this kind of thing looking for. And when I get all frustrated like that, I miss things, which was my main problem in college. The teachers tend to want to get to this point or that point and spit out some model along the way that I’d really like to dwell on, but their explanation is, “It exists because we need it for the equation all of us are on now so come on, come on.”I don’t even like to think about how long it took me to finally figure out where π came from and why we use it, and how frustrated I was with teachers who kept telling me, “Just feed your numbers into the formula and give the damn answer.”But I only hit that wall, really, there in the middle. The thing I found most useful about the book was the scientific history lessons. Reminders of when people like Newton and Aristotle lived, and just what they came up with---before we modified and reworded it. That was my favorite aspect of the book by far.My other favorite thing was the introduction to John Conway’s Game of Life. And I can’t believe I’ve never run across it before. How completely and utterly baffling, to me, that I never have. (Or maybe I have and it was just never presented in such a memorable way?) You can even download it and play with it as a “game”: http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/I’m not sure either of those links can show at all why I love the implications so much (because I haven’t actually read through those sites), but to explain I have to plagiarize pages of this book, so I’ll leave it be. And maybe call a buddy to see if he can download Life for me. Heh."
150,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,2,"The blurb calls this a major work. It's not. I know I'm in a minority, but I am not a fan of Stephen Hawking as a popularizer. Undeniably, he is a major physicist, and I remember liking his Brief History of Time, but I read that a long time ago. His popular works since are all very oversimplified, and this one could almost be considered as a children's or YA book -- I would have no problem with it if it were marketed as such. But as an adult book, it covers no new ground which is not covered in more depth in many other popular science books.He begins by saying that ""philosophy is dead"", replaced by science. Okay, as someone with a degree in philosophy that may have prejudiced me to begin with. He then spends about 15% of this very short book giving a lightweight history of philosophy, not only oversimplified but full of errors. For example, he calls Thomas Aquinas an ""early Christian philosopher"" -- even if we consider modern philosophers who happen to be Christians as ""Christian philosophers"", he was past the middle, closer to today in time than to the real ""early Christian"" philosophers like Tertullian, Origen and Augustine. He calls Aristotle the leader in rejecting observational science -- actually he was probably the best observational scientist in antiquity, especially in his specialty of marine biology. He contrasts him to Galileo on the question of falling bodies -- probably it was Aristotle who actually experimented on this, dropping objects in liquid to slow them down and thereby discovering the laws of bodies at final velocity; while Galileo certainly never dropped the balls from the tower of Pisa -- he didn't have the instruments to prove anything that way anyway -- and whether he did the experiment with inclined planes is open to doubt (his first edition talks about rolling balls, which would have given very different results than he claimed; the later editions correct it to sliding blocks.)Hawking then moves to physics ""lite"", and while I'm not presumptuous enough to claim there were errors, it was certainly very oversimplified. His ""philosophy"" of ""model-dependent realism"" is presented very simplistically, without any consideration of the philosophical issues it raises. He gives very briefly all the standard analogies and examples which are in every book on relativity and quantum theory, from the two-slit experiment to the inflating balloon, and almost nothing which is not found everywhere else. The book is very short; the actual text, excluding the glossary, acknowledgements and index (there is no bibliography at all), is about 180 pages, of which 30 are either just chapter titles, blank, or ornamental illustrations. The font size is very large, and there are unnecessary large illustrations throughout, giving it the appearance of a children's book -- I know he has physical limitations on writing long books, and has more important things to work on, but it would have been more honest to write a short book than to pad it out to look longer than it is.Only the last ten or fifteen pages have anything which might be new to some people (but it's all in his earlier books) -- the no-boundary condition as a basis for the multiverse, very lightly explained. I was very disappointed in this book."
151,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13151041-manish-sinha,4,"This book isn't for beginners. They should first read more simpler books before starting with this one. The first few chapters of the book are relatively easy to understand and need just basic physics to understand. It assumed you remember concepts of physics like matter-wave-duality. It even assumes you have a basic knowledge of our view of universe some two hundred years back like we are in center of universe etc.The book contains beautiful graphical depictions and photos. It makes the book easy to read and to some extent interesting.This book asks a beautiful philosophical question ""What is reality?"". It explains that our knowledge of ""reality"" keeps on changing as we question ourselves and build our the scientific temper.Later on in the book Hawking uses more difficult terms like space-time and references to Feynman which some people might want to skip if they don't have a stronger physics background.One of the most interesting chapter is ""Choosing our Universe"". In that chapter he explains Creation myths in various cultures and traditions. Then he goes ahead and explains the big bang and how galaxies are expanding, terms like gravity well, space-time wrap etc.Explaining the book in more detail would act like a baaad spoiler. I guess my review did act a spoiler to some extent, but I would prefer to put it forward as a ""trailer"" to the beautiful journey of reading the book."
152,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2284638-jonathan,2,"The subtitle to this book could have been ""Assertions in search of an argument."" The book isn't documented and arguments aren't given at some key points. Hawking and Mlodinow also manage to make themselves look a little naive at times. For example, stating, in the very beginning of the book, that ""philosophy is dead"" and then going on to rest their entire theory on a (highly controversial) philosophical theory of model-dependent realism. Of course, Hawking is a huge authority in the eyes of the public, so the layperson will eat this stuff up, hook, line, and sinker. Unfortunately, I'm sure I'll be hearing about how Feynman's sum-over-histories proves the many worlds hypothesis for a long time my now, by people who really have no idea what exactly it is or how exactly it proves it.

156,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"As a longtime fan of the popular science books of the late Stephen Hawking it is nice to be able to extolled his book co-authorized by Leonard Mlodinow, The Grand Design. Because so much of this book is about quantum mechanics it can be hard on almost all readers. Advanced level readers will find it too basic and perhaps dislike the orientation/history that opens the book. Readers with little or no background should be relatively comfortable. For myself I remember the several versions of the statements made in this book. If you think you understand Quantum, you don’t. Or the better one: If thinking about Quantum mechanics does not blow your mind, then you do not understand it.Having read the book, I can say without shame that my mind is blown, but in a very positive way. The lack of lineal logic makes a logic of its own. I had been one to argue, loudly that ours is a world of cause and effect. Not fully appreciating I was stuck in a Newtonian world and behind by everything since before Einstein. The universe is much more likely: cause and most likely or probable effect. The various qualifiers “likely” and “probable” are deliberate and more in line with a host of things we now think we know and that call into question a lot about what we were certain we knew. Physics and math still rule but only up to a more or less predictable limit.A friend of mine, a Ph. D Physics and with profound religious beliefs once proposed that the space between cause and effect and cause and probable effect is where God can(?) express his/her will. He may be right.Two specific explanations in The Grand Design stand out as particularly enlightening. We are bound by our senses in what we can understand. If we are so many gold fishes living in gold fishbowls, our view of the universe would be of a more curved and less linear universe. Our models of the universe would reflect our experience of relating to the universe through the distortion of the gold fish bowl. It would be unlikely that any experiment we designed or results we generated could be controlled for the limits on our ability to comprehend our model of the universe. It is therefore just as likely that as humans we are bound to the universe we are in and unable to build experiments beyond the limits of this particular universe. Could we escape the limits of the models we can imagine and the limits on reading our test results, it may be that we could close the gap in the in the probable side of cause and effect, or we might just find new ways to reach the same limitationsAgainst those who write science fiction based on the notion that there are other universes, and play with the variations possible in a ‘mega’ universe of unlimited alternate universes, Hawking and Mlodinow limit the number of possible universes to something like 1 *10 to the 100th power. So we are in one of a google-plex of possible worlds and that number can vary as some will be less stable than others. Creating an ongoing cycle of new ones from the matter and energy of the less stable.On a more specific level, I had never had much respect for Feynman’s concept of sum over histories. That any given time particles take every possible path to where ever they are finally detected. Rather like one of us buying tickets from LA to Las Vegas via every possible combination of flights that leave the LA Airport in any given time but ultimately connect to the McCarran International Airport in North Vegas. Nevermind the problem of us being in several airplanes at the same time. Quantum allows for that, or something like it; who among us has at the sub atomic or economic level has that much energy or that much money? Via the illustrations and the rest, I think I almost get that in the sum over histories, some possibilities cancel out others with the results favoring only a few probabilities. So that maybe LA to Bakersfield to Las Vegas makes some kind of sense and therefore has some probability; while LA to Hong Kong to Atlanta, back to San Francisco and then to Vegas, not as much.Having read other Stephen Hawking’s books before, The Grand Design has some very high quality illustrations and some wonderful cartoons. In the cartoons I detect the famous Hawking’s wit but in the great and greatly helpful illustrations I speculate that I see the previously unknown (to me) hand of Leonard Mlodinow.Once again a relatively readable book. Perhaps better for the sometime dabbler in physics and less so for the serious student. In my day we had college classes affectionately known as Physics for poets. The Grand Design might be perfect for that reader."

It is a thought-provoking and a fascinating journey that makes us meditate and question our deepest convictions. Thanks to this book, I had a glance at the amazing world of modern physics that I couldn't find anywhere else since all the documentries that claim explaining those concepts do nothing but mystifying us even more.Though it is a pro-atheist assay, the scientific concepts are well explained and nicely illustrated. What we know today about our universe is amazingly puzzling ! Scientific theories are now based on mathematics so advanced that they no longer agree with our everyday experience, and it makes them hard to imagine. Space, time, the cause-and-effect principle and other corner stones of our reasoning are twisted and sometimes abandoned in modern physics. Though the authour doesn't see any other miracle in all of these phenomena but the maths and us wodering about it, I see miracles everywhere ! "

One does not simply shove quantum physics and the questions of laws of nature so easily at people. To introduce ""heavy"" concepts, the authors infused the appropriate amount of relatable humours. The authors also beautifully picked up human histories that reflects each modern achievement in physics, which is very interesting to look at. This is indeed the first time I have ever smile and laughed at a book about quantum physics. Oh Lord, I love the language. It is so easy to understand the language yet it is by no means superficial. It is as grand as its title. I would suggest all science students to make this book a compulsory reading, for its ways of argument and logic will be very helpful. It is also helpful for those who are practicing to communicate the sciences. Science in this book, is very well-communicated."

I have read a fair bit of science history so those parts of the book I already knew and understood (mostly). But when it comes to the actuall science I have no idea. I recognise a fair bit of it from earlier readings, but recognition and understanding is two compleatly different things. Then again, can you understand modern physics? You can understand the math, the experiments and the applications. But can you really grasp what it means? As a monkey from the grass plains of Africa. “If you are not completely confused by quantum mechanics, you do not understand it” as one physisist put it. And I am both confused and I dont understand it. But that is not the fault of this book, its me and (I am pretty sure) my evoultionary history. Planck scale makes no sense. The big numbers in this book makes no sense. My brain has not evolved to grasp these concepts. And I dont think anyones have. But if you have the math, at least you can get a theoretical understanding of it. I have no idea if the M-theory is the right one, no one seems to do, so I Guess we will have to wait another 20-30 years and see what they find out. "

There were many jokes snuck into the writing, some reminding me strongly of A Series of Unfortunate Events (paraphrased from this book: symmetrical like a doughnut, unless one side has chocolate topping in which case it would be better to eat it.) The jokes could be odd or incongruous but were not dwelt upon which gave them an added charm of just being snuck in. The philosophical nature of the books ideas, and how easily points could be applied outside of science did well at grabbing my imagination."

It certainly does give the reader many ideas to think about. In an attempt to make scientific discussion more palatable to the layman, corny jokes were scattered throughout the book. I could have done without those. "

Some ideas and concepts are hard for me to understand it due to some technical concepts and information that i barely know about i. it triggers and arises some questions in me outside my every day life scope. Does quantum physics in some cases (as electrons could be at 2 places at once) violates logic (non contradiction law as example) ? 
163,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow (Note. This is a revised review. I was unhappy with the original.) ""The Grand Design"" is one of the most ambitious books ever written by one of the world's great thinkers. It attempts to answer the ultimate questions of life through science. The ultimate question of course and the title of this book, is the apparent grand design offer proof for a supernatural designer. This fascinating 208-page book, is composed of the following eight chapters: 1. The Mystery of Being, 2. The Rule of Law, 3. What Is Reality, 4. Alternative Histories, 5. The Theory of Everything, 6. Choosing Our Universe, 7. The Apparent Miracle, and 8. The Grand Design. Positives: 1. An ambitious book that is well-written, well-researched and concise. 2. Surprisingly accessible book that is profound without being unintelligible. 3. Evenhanded, respectful tone throughout. 4. In essence, a modern update to life's biggest questions. 5. No complex mathematical equations to worry about, elegant prose was used to convey concepts. 6. Great use of illustrations. 7. This book is in essence about the M-theory Network. What phenomena it describes and what are the limitations. 8. Thought-provoking book indeed and fascinating quotes, ""Ignorance of nature's ways led people in ancient times to invent gods to lord it over every aspect of human life"". 9. An interesting look at the history of scientific inquiry. 10. Fascinating tidbits throughout. 11. The debunking of free will. 12. The explanation of what constitutes an effective theory in physics. 13. Model-dependent realism defined. Very interesting. 14. The explanation of what quantum physics really is. 15. Special and general relativity in context. 16. The search for quantum versions of the laws of physics. 17. The never-ending quest for the theory of everything. 18. The history of the ""big bang"". 19. A clear explanation of what we do know versus what we don't know. 20. The realization that time behaves like space... 21. The anthropic principles defined. 22. The triple alpha process...who knew? 23. The multiverse concept defined and how it can explain the fine-tuning of physical laws. 24. Spontaneous creation. 25. A much needed glossary of terms. Negatives: 1. Will disappoint the more scientifically minded as this book was written for the masses. 2. This is an accessible book by design but the nature of physics is so complex that it will still leave some readers dumfounded. 3. The book's hype may have lead some readers with the wrong impression and thus not satisfied with the end result. 4. I think some readers expected new groundbreaking ideas (and please correct me if I'm wrong) but in reality it's a book that provides the latest in scientific knowledge and future aspirations. 5. Philosophy is still alive and well. 6. He has yet to find the Holy Grail of Physics. In other words, the book feels incomplete because it is. In summary, this is a very solid concise book but it doesn't ultimately answer all the questions and will leave those readers with higher albeit unreasonable expectations with a degree of dissatisfaction. It's a book meant for the masses and in that respect accomplishes what it sought out to do. However, for those with higher physics acumen this book as evidenced by the reviews from readers who hold Hawking in high regard, it will be disappointing. If you are a layperson this book is a worthwhile read, on the other hand wait for a more advanced edition or book. Recommendations: ""Physics of the Future"" by Michio Kaku, ""The Age of Everything"" by Mathew Hedman, and ""The Elegant Universe"" by Brian Greene."

165,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256070-jose,2,"I think this book deserves one star but I can't bring myself to give that rating to a book by the great Stephen Hawking. I don't even know where to start... if you read A Brief History of Time just reread that. That book is light years ahead and I honestly thought maybe this one was meant for adolescents. There is some interesting discussion in the beginning about the nature of physical models but it is quickly abandoned. Ok that's fine, bring on the ""real"" science right? Wrong. In fact the entire book rushes through topics quickly and unsatisfyingly. There are a few nuggets but for a book that I read in just 3 QUICK sittings this is not enough. I did like reading it but it was all stuff I had seen before and to better depth. Maybe I just came with too high of expectations.The book claims to offer answers to the BIG questions. If you didn't know much about modern physics and saw this get ready for a big disappointment. Surprise! science doesn't know why the universe came into existence. It also doesn't know why the universe has the laws it does have. The book claims it is because there are many universes and we happen to be in one with ""good"" laws. Does that pass anybody's BS test? In fact, upon my reading it's hard not to conclude that current physics is pretty utterly lost. I don't know how Mr. Hawking can think string theory is anything more than a giant math trick. Physical theories have to be experimentally grounded and M Theory is a joke. By the way, it is barely, barely defined here! Not even the traditional high level description of it. I'm sorry but when our best unified physical theory for the universe calls for the existence of an enormous amount of parallel universes and is untestable... it is worthless. "
166,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5496860-julie-shennan,1,"THE problem with Stephen Hawking’s creation theory is it’s not his theory. His latest novel The Grand Design paraphrases every scientific, religious and mythological hypothesis of the universe, except his own. After 180 pages of mind numbing reading, I reached the conclusion, hoping beyond hope, this would be Hawking’s big revelation. Alas, it wasn’t, instead he said, ‘the M - theory is the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe’...That would be Edward Witten’s M Theory. What is this M Theory? Well, I got the impression that it was just a combination of theories which offered a spatial reading of creation, no pun intended. These theories outline that cosmos aren’t linear so don’t have a set matter, place, era or event in which they started, such as the creation of our universe. The theories also state multiple universes were created at the same time, with different environments and natural laws.Hawkins argues this spatial reading of creation clashes with the Christian First Cause Theory, because it suggests that there was never a blank canvas for God to create life from. He also claims that the simultaneous creation of multiple universes suggest that our planet is not unique in its hospitable climate, and so was not created especially for us, as the Grand Design theory suggests.Yet, Hawkins critique of Christianity is unoriginal, and with no evidence to further Edward Witten’s theory I can’t help but think if The Grand Design were a dissertation, it would merit a fail."
167,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45877282-jeffrey-debris,5,"It's almost impossible to imagine that Stephen Hawking has passed away. He was one of our brightest minds and reading this book has changed the way I perceive reality in quite a few ways. The book starts with this sentence: ""We each exist for but a short time, and in that time explore but a small part of the whole universe."" Given just how mindbogglingly big our universe is, this sentence hit home right away for me.Hawking then goes on to inspire us, by saying that the Human species is a curious one, in constant search of answers to questions. This book aims to answer a couple of the great ones in our lives. What is reality? Does God exist? Does a multiverse exist?Each chapter in this wonderful book aims at giving an answer to these important questions. Hawking lays it all out in front of the reader in language that even the layman (like me) can understand. He does so with a smooth writing style and a touch of humour, which keeps things a bit lighter than they really are.This is one of those books you really want to have in your collection for more than one reason. It aims to explain, but it will also spark your imagination, and make you want to learn more about our universe. I will definitely pick this one up again at some time, simply to remind myself just how brilliant a mind Stephen Hawking had and how science can possibly be our greatest hope of survival in this crazy, chaotic world we live in."
168,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,3,"Hawking is a terrific self-promoter, and he managed to grab a lot of headlines for this book by claiming he'd killed God or whatever, but the truth is there's very little in this book that Brian Greene didn't cover - and cover better - ten years ago. In fact, a lot of this is stuff Hawking himself has covered in A Brief History of Time.In the last chapter he brings up Conway and Turing and things get significantly more interesting, but it's too late by that time, since Hawking apparently feels he can't publish a book of more than 200 pages. I felt like we were at the start of something interesting there; I would've liked to hear more about it.In general, this confirms that I'm not a big fan of Hawking. He bills himself as ""science explained for the masses,"" but he doesn't actually explain things all that well - or, at least, there are folks who can explain it better. And in trying to cover so much in his books, he ends up covering nothing well enough."
169,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12508032-jyotsna,2,"Actual rating: 2.5 starsI kind of have mixed feelings about this book. What I did not like: This is a book by physicists for physicists. Being an engineer and having had a good interest in physics, the book was easier to read, but if any person with no background of physics picked this up, they would be totally lost! This book is not for the masses, it purely talks to those intellectuals in the science field. What I liked: The good explanation of physics and mainly theoretical physics as a whole. I liked the breakdown of various theories from Newtonian physics to Quantum physics.  The idea of attempting to explain the universe in a scientific manner does work as the writers assume that you have to go from A to Z and not feed you the intermediate steps directly. In short, a well organised book.Conclusion: Only read if you are actually aware of basic physics. Otherwise, you may not enjoy it that much."
170,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/651858-george-musser,2,"Frankly I found the book incoherent. It argues on the one hand that a final theory of physics is unattainable, because there's no objective way to decide among competing theories (a position they call ""model-dependent realism""), and on the other hand, it says that physicists have found such a theory: M-theory. The authors do not acknowledge this apparent contradiction, let alone explain how it might be resolved. (I personally think it can be done, but shouldn't the authors do this for us?) Crucial concepts, such as why M-theory should be taken as the final theory to begin with, are hardly explained, and the authors present model-dependent realism as though it were their own brainchild, not acknowledging the work of Poincare, Bohr, and the positivists."
171,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3657860-bob-finch,3,"The first half of the book was reasonably well presented, albeit very brief (most non-specialists would benefit from a lot more more background), but the remainder left me wanting. This is not a book for scientists, and unless the reader is willing to accept all that is said at face value, trying to find supporting information within these pages is largely futile (the motivated reader might search for such support elsewhere). And the punch line, that M-Theory (undefined) may answer all questions about the origins and nature of the physical universe, is pretty much left undeveloped. The book is nevertheless interesting if only to glean a bit of insight into some (pretty counter-intuitive) alternative explanations of reality. "

176,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162048-james-carroll,4,"""Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge."" Stephen HawkingI couldn't agree with that statement more. Some of his other conclusions in the book from which the quote was taken ""The Grand Design""... not so much.But in what way is philosophy dead? Clearly the love of wisdom is not dead, but it may well be that the field of liberal arts philosophy may indeed be dead (or at least loosing relevance and productivity). To attempt to discover the real truth requires more than sitting and thinking, it requires observation, and then modeling, which requires math. This means that today the mathematicians and physicists are doing the real leg work of philosophy, while the liberal arts philosophers are, for the most part, spinning their wheels. There is a feeling that theology and philosophy should be the ones asking the questions about morality, theology, meaning, and God, while science should keep its distance. But I believe that you can't ask these questions correctly without a firm grounding in the observations of science and physics, which MUST inform any inquiry into philosophy, or even theology. As Einstein said, science without theology is lame (in the sense of not having the power to move things forward), while theology without science is blind (in the sense of moving forward, but not seeing where it is really going). Therefore, I find that I simply can not agree with those that say that science should leave such theological matters to religion. In my view, Stephen Hawking has every right to venture into the field of theology, and to bravely see what implications his understanding of the laws of physics has on his understanding of God. This is a useful and potentially very productive undertaking.Let us take some of Hawking's conclusions in this book as an example, and see how science can inform theology:1. In the beginning, the world was very small, thus the rules of Quantum Mechanics hold, and things like the universe can (and indeed will) appear out of nothing without violating the rules of quantum mechanics, so long as it eventually cancels itself out, just as virtual particles usually do.2. The universe has an equal amount of positive and negative energy, and so is a cosmic free lunch, and can (and will) appear out of nothing (essentially, the universe cancels itself out, much like virtual particles do).3. But the universe was also hugely massive, so it followed not only the rules of quantum mechanics, but also the rules of relativity, which says that mass bends space and time, and at the point where you have enough mass to make a black hole (as we clearly had in the early universe), time itself stops, so there IS no time before the big bang, time curves back upon itself, and comes to a single closed point, creating a beginning not only of the universe, but of time itself, and thus it creates a beginning to the chain of causation. The chain of causation (where the causes come before the results) comes to an end at the Big bang, which necessarily had no cause, because there was no time before the big bang for that cause to act in. His conclusion? There is no God in the platonic sense of the ""prime mover"" or ""first cause"" because 1. we don't need him to explain how and why the universe could come into being, (quantum mechanics does that) and 2. there could be no creator of the universe, because there was no time before the universe was created for Him to act in. Essentially, God could not ""cause"" the universe, because relativity guarantees that there was no time in which he could act to initiate such a cause, and after the big bang bangs, we don't need Him to explain the progression of the universe from that point on (the laws of nature do that). Whether or not you agree with these conclusions (which I do not), it is clear that a firm understanding of the issues surrounding quantum mechanics should indeed necessarily inform our theology. Even if his reasoning here is flawed, that is the way science works. It is necessary for someone to make these sorts of inferences, so that science can move forward and either prove or disprove this theory.So, why don't I come to the same conclusions as Hawking? His reasoning appears rather solid at first glance. However, relativity and quantum mechanics are notorious for their inability to play nicely together, and there are a myriad of potential theories that have been proposed in an attempt to produce a good theory of quantum gravity. He is here espousing one of these theories, granted, it is the one that is (so far) the most mathematically robust, but it is by no means the only solution to this problem. For example, some theories of quantized time predict a big bounce instead of a big bang, in which case there was indeed time before the big bang. Another competing theory predicts that two of the membranes predicted by M-theory collided, producing the big bang, again, this is a theory that predicts time before the big bang. Still other theories predict that there are other dimensions of time, outside of our own. It is also unclear to some whether quantum fluctuations can create virtual particles without space or time in which to create them, which could cast doubt on whether a quantum fluctuation alone could create the universe from no-where and no-when. The possibilities are nearly endless. And, most importantly, we have yet to find observations that can clearly differentiate between many of these competing theories. Essentially, we have no observationally verified theory of quantum gravity, which is necessary before we can make any real predictions of how the universe behaved in these early moments that are so essential to Hawking's arguments.So, if we take this into consideration, we can rephrase Stephen Hawking's brilliant deduction differently. IF we accept THIS theory of quantum gravity, together with its predictions about quantum fluctuations and the beginning of time, THEN the universe necessarily had no cause within our dimension of time, and thus, there is no God that exists solely within our universe's dimension of time. I believe that this is a valid deduction, and, to some extent, it should inform our understanding of God. It is only unfortunate that he didn't state his conclusions with this level of cautiousness. Instead, he is far more confident in his conclusions than is warranted by the data, and he leaves out the many ""if""s that should have preceded his conclusion. This was perhaps my only serious disagreement with the Book.And what of my own conclusions about God? That is not really what this review is about, but to be short:Theleologians in my chosen branch of Christianity have often said that God does not just predict the future, he quite literally sees it. For this to be the case, God must, of necessity, exist outside of our dimension of time, and likely outside of our dimensions of space as well. I find the fact that science is now predicting a universe of multiple dimensions and multiple universes (some with different laws of physics), and is finding that God cannot exist only within our dimension of time and still create the universe, to be quite faith promoting since that is in line with what I believed all along. Stephen Hawking would likely take issue with my interpretation of his work, but hey, that is what Science is all about, and we should be grateful to Stephen Hawking for so clearly expressing this brilliant deduction.

177,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176602-shaimaa-ali,3,"In this book, both scientists (Hawking & Mlodinow) tried to explore an answer to so many existential questions.. “why do we exist?, why is there something rather than nothing?, why this particular set of laws and not some other?” .. in general, they tried to answer why the universe behave this way, not only to describe how .. Did they manage to do so?, I doubt!Trying first to disqualify Philosophy saying it’s dead ( although mere advances started first from philosophers’ thinking -true or false- but it was just a start!, then building the meaning of reality ( which was basically philosophical at first, then continued by simple explanations of Quantum Physics and some other terms: ( 4 forces of nature, General relativity, Special relativity, QED, QCD & GUT). All that was good & easy to follow, while some other terms & principals were not that easy [Like: re-normalization, W+, W- & Z0 particles , or other philosophical descriptions(again) as creating history by our own observations rather than history creating us], the last model of creation (Game of life) & its shape models was quite difficult to fathom!The last 2 chapters were quite contradictory to each other, while in Chapter 7 “The Apparent Miracle” was in my opinion an evidence that this universe can’t be a result of a coincidence as in page 160 ( Change those rules of our universe just a bit, and the conditions for our existence disappear! ), Chapter 8 “The Grand Design “ page 179, claims arrogantly that ( we are the creators - we choose the initial state of the universe by specifying objects and their positions at the start of the game). Where were we when we started selecting all these laws & conditions?!! The weakest point in this book, that it didn’t describe well the theories that the M-theory consists of, hence when last phrase in the book confirms that this theory isn’t confirmed by observations, then it became totally vague to confirm the writers’ opinion at all!!

178,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,5,"Hawking the man is gone now, but the influence of his intellect remains. In this book he explains why there is something rather than nothing, and whether that existence requires a deity to drive it. He simplifies to a great extent an extraordinarily complex subject, although without a working understanding of the necessary math, no lay person can truly claim to understand the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, string theory, or M-theory. Hawking certainly makes it possible for us to get a feel for the subject, though, without scaring us away with equations. If you want a lucid introduction to current theories of cosmology, read this book. And Hawking's wry humor infuses the text. "

180,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,2,"The blurb calls this a major work. It's not. I know I'm in a minority, but I am not a fan of Stephen Hawking as a popularizer. Undeniably, he is a major physicist, and I remember liking his Brief History of Time, but I read that a long time ago. His popular works since are all very oversimplified, and this one could almost be considered as a children's or YA book -- I would have no problem with it if it were marketed as such. But as an adult book, it covers no new ground which is not covered in more depth in many other popular science books.He begins by saying that ""philosophy is dead"", replaced by science. Okay, as someone with a degree in philosophy that may have prejudiced me to begin with. He then spends about 15% of this very short book giving a lightweight history of philosophy, not only oversimplified but full of errors. For example, he calls Thomas Aquinas an ""early Christian philosopher"" -- even if we consider modern philosophers who happen to be Christians as ""Christian philosophers"", he was past the middle, closer to today in time than to the real ""early Christian"" philosophers like Tertullian, Origen and Augustine. He calls Aristotle the leader in rejecting observational science -- actually he was probably the best observational scientist in antiquity, especially in his specialty of marine biology. He contrasts him to Galileo on the question of falling bodies -- probably it was Aristotle who actually experimented on this, dropping objects in liquid to slow them down and thereby discovering the laws of bodies at final velocity; while Galileo certainly never dropped the balls from the tower of Pisa -- he didn't have the instruments to prove anything that way anyway -- and whether he did the experiment with inclined planes is open to doubt (his first edition talks about rolling balls, which would have given very different results than he claimed; the later editions correct it to sliding blocks.)Hawking then moves to physics ""lite"", and while I'm not presumptuous enough to claim there were errors, it was certainly very oversimplified. His ""philosophy"" of ""model-dependent realism"" is presented very simplistically, without any consideration of the philosophical issues it raises. He gives very briefly all the standard analogies and examples which are in every book on relativity and quantum theory, from the two-slit experiment to the inflating balloon, and almost nothing which is not found everywhere else. The book is very short; the actual text, excluding the glossary, acknowledgements and index (there is no bibliography at all), is about 180 pages, of which 30 are either just chapter titles, blank, or ornamental illustrations. The font size is very large, and there are unnecessary large illustrations throughout, giving it the appearance of a children's book -- I know he has physical limitations on writing long books, and has more important things to work on, but it would have been more honest to write a short book than to pad it out to look longer than it is.Only the last ten or fifteen pages have anything which might be new to some people (but it's all in his earlier books) -- the no-boundary condition as a basis for the multiverse, very lightly explained. I was very disappointed in this book."

The first few chapters of the book are relatively easy to understand and need just basic physics to understand. It assumed you remember concepts of physics like matter-wave-duality. It even assumes you have a basic knowledge of our view of universe some two hundred years back like we are in center of universe etc.The book contains beautiful graphical depictions and photos. It makes the book easy to read and to some extent interesting.This book asks a beautiful philosophical question ""What is reality?"". It explains that our knowledge of ""reality"" keeps on changing as we question ourselves and build our the scientific temper.Later on in the book Hawking uses more difficult terms like space-time and references to Feynman which some people might want to skip if they don't have a stronger physics background.One of the most interesting chapter is ""Choosing our Universe"". In that chapter he explains Creation myths in various cultures and traditions. Then he goes ahead and explains the big bang and how galaxies are expanding, terms like gravity well, space-time wrap etc.Explaining the book in more detail would act like a baaad spoiler. I guess my review did act a spoiler to some extent, but I would prefer to put it forward as a ""trailer"" to the beautiful journey of reading the book."

Of course, Hawking is a huge authority in the eyes of the public, so the layperson will eat this stuff up, hook, line, and sinker.

M-theory is a complex unified theory of essentially the makeup of everything, explained throughout this book with fun diagrams and medium difficulty explanations by one of the most brilliant minds of our time.Simply put, its a great read for those looking to venture into the beginning of the great scientific rabbit hole that is the understanding of why we all are here.""The fact that we human beings - who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature - have been able to come this close to an understanding of the laws governing us and our universe is a great triumph."" -pg 181"

186,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"As a longtime fan of the popular science books of the late Stephen Hawking it is nice to be able to extolled his book co-authorized by Leonard Mlodinow, The Grand Design. Because so much of this book is about quantum mechanics it can be hard on almost all readers. Advanced level readers will find it too basic and perhaps dislike the orientation/history that opens the book. Readers with little or no background should be relatively comfortable. For myself I remember the several versions of the statements made in this book. If you think you understand Quantum, you don’t. Or the better one: If thinking about Quantum mechanics does not blow your mind, then you do not understand it.Having read the book, I can say without shame that my mind is blown, but in a very positive way. The lack of lineal logic makes a logic of its own. I had been one to argue, loudly that ours is a world of cause and effect. Not fully appreciating I was stuck in a Newtonian world and behind by everything since before Einstein. The universe is much more likely: cause and most likely or probable effect. The various qualifiers “likely” and “probable” are deliberate and more in line with a host of things we now think we know and that call into question a lot about what we were certain we knew. Physics and math still rule but only up to a more or less predictable limit.A friend of mine, a Ph. D Physics and with profound religious beliefs once proposed that the space between cause and effect and cause and probable effect is where God can(?) express his/her will. He may be right.Two specific explanations in The Grand Design stand out as particularly enlightening. We are bound by our senses in what we can understand. If we are so many gold fishes living in gold fishbowls, our view of the universe would be of a more curved and less linear universe. Our models of the universe would reflect our experience of relating to the universe through the distortion of the gold fish bowl. It would be unlikely that any experiment we designed or results we generated could be controlled for the limits on our ability to comprehend our model of the universe. It is therefore just as likely that as humans we are bound to the universe we are in and unable to build experiments beyond the limits of this particular universe. Could we escape the limits of the models we can imagine and the limits on reading our test results, it may be that we could close the gap in the in the probable side of cause and effect, or we might just find new ways to reach the same limitationsAgainst those who write science fiction based on the notion that there are other universes, and play with the variations possible in a ‘mega’ universe of unlimited alternate universes, Hawking and Mlodinow limit the number of possible universes to something like 1 *10 to the 100th power. So we are in one of a google-plex of possible worlds and that number can vary as some will be less stable than others. Creating an ongoing cycle of new ones from the matter and energy of the less stable.On a more specific level, I had never had much respect for Feynman’s concept of sum over histories. That any given time particles take every possible path to where ever they are finally detected. Rather like one of us buying tickets from LA to Las Vegas via every possible combination of flights that leave the LA Airport in any given time but ultimately connect to the McCarran International Airport in North Vegas. Nevermind the problem of us being in several airplanes at the same time. Quantum allows for that, or something like it; who among us has at the sub atomic or economic level has that much energy or that much money? Via the illustrations and the rest, I think I almost get that in the sum over histories, some possibilities cancel out others with the results favoring only a few probabilities. So that maybe LA to Bakersfield to Las Vegas makes some kind of sense and therefore has some probability; while LA to Hong Kong to Atlanta, back to San Francisco and then to Vegas, not as much.Having read other Stephen Hawking’s books before, The Grand Design has some very high quality illustrations and some wonderful cartoons. In the cartoons I detect the famous Hawking’s wit but in the great and greatly helpful illustrations I speculate that I see the previously unknown (to me) hand of Leonard Mlodinow.Once again a relatively readable book. Perhaps better for the sometime dabbler in physics and less so for the serious student. In my day we had college classes affectionately known as Physics for poets. The Grand Design might be perfect for that reader."

It is a thought-provoking and a fascinating journey that makes us meditate and question our deepest convictions. Thanks to this book, I had a glance at the amazing world of modern physics that I couldn't find anywhere else since all the documentries that claim explaining those concepts do nothing but mystifying us even more.Though it is a pro-atheist assay, the scientific concepts are well explained and nicely illustrated. What we know today about our universe is amazingly puzzling ! Scientific theories are now based on mathematics so advanced that they no longer agree with our everyday experience, and it makes them hard to imagine. Space, time, the cause-and-effect principle and other corner stones of our reasoning are twisted and sometimes abandoned in modern physics. Though the authour doesn't see any other miracle in all of these phenomena but the maths and us wodering about it, I see miracles everywhere ! "
188,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54949416-najmi-ayob,5,"A great book, provocative yet amazing. This book is proposing M-theory (a candidate for the TOE) but it does so gracefully. One does not simply shove quantum physics and the questions of laws of nature so easily at people. To introduce ""heavy"" concepts, the authors infused the appropriate amount of relatable humours. The authors also beautifully picked up human histories that reflects each modern achievement in physics, which is very interesting to look at. This is indeed the first time I have ever smile and laughed at a book about quantum physics. Oh Lord, I love the language. It is so easy to understand the language yet it is by no means superficial. It is as grand as its title. I would suggest all science students to make this book a compulsory reading, for its ways of argument and logic will be very helpful. It is also helpful for those who are practicing to communicate the sciences. Science in this book, is very well-communicated."

I have read a fair bit of science history so those parts of the book I already knew and understood (mostly). But when it comes to the actuall science I have no idea. I recognise a fair bit of it from earlier readings, but recognition and understanding is two compleatly different things. Then again, can you understand modern physics? You can understand the math, the experiments and the applications. But can you really grasp what it means? As a monkey from the grass plains of Africa. “If you are not completely confused by quantum mechanics, you do not understand it” as one physisist put it. And I am both confused and I dont understand it. But that is not the fault of this book, its me and (I am pretty sure) my evoultionary history. Planck scale makes no sense. The big numbers in this book makes no sense. My brain has not evolved to grasp these concepts. And I dont think anyones have. But if you have the math, at least you can get a theoretical understanding of it. I have no idea if the M-theory is the right one, no one seems to do, so I Guess we will have to wait another 20-30 years and see what they find out. "

There were many jokes snuck into the writing, some reminding me strongly of A Series of Unfortunate Events (paraphrased from this book: symmetrical like a doughnut, unless one side has chocolate topping in which case it would be better to eat it.) The jokes could be odd or incongruous but were not dwelt upon which gave them an added charm of just being snuck in. The philosophical nature of the books ideas, and how easily points could be applied outside of science did well at grabbing my imagination."

I could have done without those. "

Some ideas and concepts are hard for me to understand it due to some technical concepts and information that i barely know about i. it triggers and arises some questions in me outside my every day life scope.

""The Grand Design"" is one of the most ambitious books ever written by one of the world's great thinkers. It attempts to answer the ultimate questions of life through science. The ultimate question of course and the title of this book, is the apparent grand design offer proof for a supernatural designer. This fascinating 208-page book, is composed of the following eight chapters: 1. The Mystery of Being, 2. The Rule of Law, 3. What Is Reality, 4. Alternative Histories, 5. The Theory of Everything, 6. Choosing Our Universe, 7. The Apparent Miracle, and 8. The Grand Design. Positives: 1. An ambitious book that is well-written, well-researched and concise. 2. Surprisingly accessible book that is profound without being unintelligible. 3. Evenhanded, respectful tone throughout. 4. In essence, a modern update to life's biggest questions. 5. No complex mathematical equations to worry about, elegant prose was used to convey concepts. 6. Great use of illustrations. 7. This book is in essence about the M-theory Network. What phenomena it describes and what are the limitations. 8. Thought-provoking book indeed and fascinating quotes, ""Ignorance of nature's ways led people in ancient times to invent gods to lord it over every aspect of human life"". 9. An interesting look at the history of scientific inquiry. 10. Fascinating tidbits throughout. 11. The debunking of free will. 12. The explanation of what constitutes an effective theory in physics. 13. Model-dependent realism defined. Very interesting. 14. The explanation of what quantum physics really is. 15. Special and general relativity in context. 16. The search for quantum versions of the laws of physics. 17. The never-ending quest for the theory of everything. 18. The history of the ""big bang"". 19. A clear explanation of what we do know versus what we don't know. 20. The realization that time behaves like space... 21. The anthropic principles defined. 22. The triple alpha process...who knew? 23. The multiverse concept defined and how it can explain the fine-tuning of physical laws. 24. Spontaneous creation. 25. A much needed glossary of terms. Negatives: 1. Will disappoint the more scientifically minded as this book was written for the masses. 2. This is an accessible book by design but the nature of physics is so complex that it will still leave some readers dumfounded. 3. The book's hype may have lead some readers with the wrong impression and thus not satisfied with the end result. 4. I think some readers expected new groundbreaking ideas (and please correct me if I'm wrong) but in reality it's a book that provides the latest in scientific knowledge and future aspirations. 5. Philosophy is still alive and well. 6. He has yet to find the Holy Grail of Physics. In other words, the book feels incomplete because it is. In summary, this is a very solid concise book but it doesn't ultimately answer all the questions and will leave those readers with higher albeit unreasonable expectations with a degree of dissatisfaction. It's a book meant for the masses and in that respect accomplishes what it sought out to do. However, for those with higher physics acumen this book as evidenced by the reviews from readers who hold Hawking in high regard, it will be disappointing. If you are a layperson this book is a worthwhile read, on the other hand wait for a more advanced edition or book. Recommendations: ""Physics of the Future"" by Michio Kaku, ""The Age of Everything"" by Mathew Hedman, and ""The Elegant Universe"" by Brian Greene."

195,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256070-jose,2,"I think this book deserves one star but I can't bring myself to give that rating to a book by the great Stephen Hawking. I don't even know where to start... if you read A Brief History of Time just reread that. That book is light years ahead and I honestly thought maybe this one was meant for adolescents. There is some interesting discussion in the beginning about the nature of physical models but it is quickly abandoned. Ok that's fine, bring on the ""real"" science right? Wrong. In fact the entire book rushes through topics quickly and unsatisfyingly. There are a few nuggets but for a book that I read in just 3 QUICK sittings this is not enough. I did like reading it but it was all stuff I had seen before and to better depth. Maybe I just came with too high of expectations.The book claims to offer answers to the BIG questions. If you didn't know much about modern physics and saw this get ready for a big disappointment. Surprise! science doesn't know why the universe came into existence. It also doesn't know why the universe has the laws it does have. The book claims it is because there are many universes and we happen to be in one with ""good"" laws. Does that pass anybody's BS test? In fact, upon my reading it's hard not to conclude that current physics is pretty utterly lost. I don't know how Mr. Hawking can think string theory is anything more than a giant math trick. Physical theories have to be experimentally grounded and M Theory is a joke. By the way, it is barely, barely defined here! Not even the traditional high level description of it. I'm sorry but when our best unified physical theory for the universe calls for the existence of an enormous amount of parallel universes and is untestable... it is worthless. "
196,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5496860-julie-shennan,1,"THE problem with Stephen Hawking’s creation theory is it’s not his theory. His latest novel The Grand Design paraphrases every scientific, religious and mythological hypothesis of the universe, except his own. After 180 pages of mind numbing reading, I reached the conclusion, hoping beyond hope, this would be Hawking’s big revelation. Alas, it wasn’t, instead he said, ‘the M - theory is the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe’...That would be Edward Witten’s M Theory. What is this M Theory? Well, I got the impression that it was just a combination of theories which offered a spatial reading of creation, no pun intended. These theories outline that cosmos aren’t linear so don’t have a set matter, place, era or event in which they started, such as the creation of our universe. The theories also state multiple universes were created at the same time, with different environments and natural laws.Hawkins argues this spatial reading of creation clashes with the Christian First Cause Theory, because it suggests that there was never a blank canvas for God to create life from. He also claims that the simultaneous creation of multiple universes suggest that our planet is not unique in its hospitable climate, and so was not created especially for us, as the Grand Design theory suggests.Yet, Hawkins critique of Christianity is unoriginal, and with no evidence to further Edward Witten’s theory I can’t help but think if The Grand Design were a dissertation, it would merit a fail."
197,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45877282-jeffrey-debris,5,"It's almost impossible to imagine that Stephen Hawking has passed away. He was one of our brightest minds and reading this book has changed the way I perceive reality in quite a few ways. The book starts with this sentence: ""We each exist for but a short time, and in that time explore but a small part of the whole universe."" Given just how mindbogglingly big our universe is, this sentence hit home right away for me.Hawking then goes on to inspire us, by saying that the Human species is a curious one, in constant search of answers to questions. This book aims to answer a couple of the great ones in our lives. What is reality? Does God exist? Does a multiverse exist?Each chapter in this wonderful book aims at giving an answer to these important questions. Hawking lays it all out in front of the reader in language that even the layman (like me) can understand. He does so with a smooth writing style and a touch of humour, which keeps things a bit lighter than they really are.This is one of those books you really want to have in your collection for more than one reason. It aims to explain, but it will also spark your imagination, and make you want to learn more about our universe. I will definitely pick this one up again at some time, simply to remind myself just how brilliant a mind Stephen Hawking had and how science can possibly be our greatest hope of survival in this crazy, chaotic world we live in."
198,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,3,"Hawking is a terrific self-promoter, and he managed to grab a lot of headlines for this book by claiming he'd killed God or whatever, but the truth is there's very little in this book that Brian Greene didn't cover - and cover better - ten years ago. In fact, a lot of this is stuff Hawking himself has covered in A Brief History of Time.In the last chapter he brings up Conway and Turing and things get significantly more interesting, but it's too late by that time, since Hawking apparently feels he can't publish a book of more than 200 pages. I felt like we were at the start of something interesting there; I would've liked to hear more about it.In general, this confirms that I'm not a big fan of Hawking. He bills himself as ""science explained for the masses,"" but he doesn't actually explain things all that well - or, at least, there are folks who can explain it better. And in trying to cover so much in his books, he ends up covering nothing well enough."
199,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12508032-jyotsna,2,"Actual rating: 2.5 starsI kind of have mixed feelings about this book. What I did not like: This is a book by physicists for physicists. Being an engineer and having had a good interest in physics, the book was easier to read, but if any person with no background of physics picked this up, they would be totally lost! This book is not for the masses, it purely talks to those intellectuals in the science field. What I liked: The good explanation of physics and mainly theoretical physics as a whole. I liked the breakdown of various theories from Newtonian physics to Quantum physics.  The idea of attempting to explain the universe in a scientific manner does work as the writers assume that you have to go from A to Z and not feed you the intermediate steps directly. In short, a well organised book.Conclusion: Only read if you are actually aware of basic physics. Otherwise, you may not enjoy it that much."
200,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/651858-george-musser,2,"Frankly I found the book incoherent. It argues on the one hand that a final theory of physics is unattainable, because there's no objective way to decide among competing theories (a position they call ""model-dependent realism""), and on the other hand, it says that physicists have found such a theory: M-theory. The authors do not acknowledge this apparent contradiction, let alone explain how it might be resolved. (I personally think it can be done, but shouldn't the authors do this for us?) Crucial concepts, such as why M-theory should be taken as the final theory to begin with, are hardly explained, and the authors present model-dependent realism as though it were their own brainchild, not acknowledging the work of Poincare, Bohr, and the positivists."
201,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3657860-bob-finch,3,"The first half of the book was reasonably well presented, albeit very brief (most non-specialists would benefit from a lot more more background), but the remainder left me wanting. This is not a book for scientists, and unless the reader is willing to accept all that is said at face value, trying to find supporting information within these pages is largely futile (the motivated reader might search for such support elsewhere). And the punch line, that M-Theory (undefined) may answer all questions about the origins and nature of the physical universe, is pretty much left undeveloped. The book is nevertheless interesting if only to glean a bit of insight into some (pretty counter-intuitive) alternative explanations of reality. "

206,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162048-james-carroll,4,"""Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge."" Stephen HawkingI couldn't agree with that statement more. Some of his other conclusions in the book from which the quote was taken ""The Grand Design""... not so much.But in what way is philosophy dead? Clearly the love of wisdom is not dead, but it may well be that the field of liberal arts philosophy may indeed be dead (or at least loosing relevance and productivity). To attempt to discover the real truth requires more than sitting and thinking, it requires observation, and then modeling, which requires math. This means that today the mathematicians and physicists are doing the real leg work of philosophy, while the liberal arts philosophers are, for the most part, spinning their wheels. There is a feeling that theology and philosophy should be the ones asking the questions about morality, theology, meaning, and God, while science should keep its distance. But I believe that you can't ask these questions correctly without a firm grounding in the observations of science and physics, which MUST inform any inquiry into philosophy, or even theology. As Einstein said, science without theology is lame (in the sense of not having the power to move things forward), while theology without science is blind (in the sense of moving forward, but not seeing where it is really going). Therefore, I find that I simply can not agree with those that say that science should leave such theological matters to religion. In my view, Stephen Hawking has every right to venture into the field of theology, and to bravely see what implications his understanding of the laws of physics has on his understanding of God. This is a useful and potentially very productive undertaking.Let us take some of Hawking's conclusions in this book as an example, and see how science can inform theology:1. In the beginning, the world was very small, thus the rules of Quantum Mechanics hold, and things like the universe can (and indeed will) appear out of nothing without violating the rules of quantum mechanics, so long as it eventually cancels itself out, just as virtual particles usually do.2. The universe has an equal amount of positive and negative energy, and so is a cosmic free lunch, and can (and will) appear out of nothing (essentially, the universe cancels itself out, much like virtual particles do).3. But the universe was also hugely massive, so it followed not only the rules of quantum mechanics, but also the rules of relativity, which says that mass bends space and time, and at the point where you have enough mass to make a black hole (as we clearly had in the early universe), time itself stops, so there IS no time before the big bang, time curves back upon itself, and comes to a single closed point, creating a beginning not only of the universe, but of time itself, and thus it creates a beginning to the chain of causation. The chain of causation (where the causes come before the results) comes to an end at the Big bang, which necessarily had no cause, because there was no time before the big bang for that cause to act in. His conclusion? There is no God in the platonic sense of the ""prime mover"" or ""first cause"" because 1. we don't need him to explain how and why the universe could come into being, (quantum mechanics does that) and 2. there could be no creator of the universe, because there was no time before the universe was created for Him to act in. Essentially, God could not ""cause"" the universe, because relativity guarantees that there was no time in which he could act to initiate such a cause, and after the big bang bangs, we don't need Him to explain the progression of the universe from that point on (the laws of nature do that). Whether or not you agree with these conclusions (which I do not), it is clear that a firm understanding of the issues surrounding quantum mechanics should indeed necessarily inform our theology. Even if his reasoning here is flawed, that is the way science works. It is necessary for someone to make these sorts of inferences, so that science can move forward and either prove or disprove this theory.So, why don't I come to the same conclusions as Hawking? His reasoning appears rather solid at first glance. However, relativity and quantum mechanics are notorious for their inability to play nicely together, and there are a myriad of potential theories that have been proposed in an attempt to produce a good theory of quantum gravity. He is here espousing one of these theories, granted, it is the one that is (so far) the most mathematically robust, but it is by no means the only solution to this problem. For example, some theories of quantized time predict a big bounce instead of a big bang, in which case there was indeed time before the big bang. Another competing theory predicts that two of the membranes predicted by M-theory collided, producing the big bang, again, this is a theory that predicts time before the big bang. Still other theories predict that there are other dimensions of time, outside of our own. It is also unclear to some whether quantum fluctuations can create virtual particles without space or time in which to create them, which could cast doubt on whether a quantum fluctuation alone could create the universe from no-where and no-when. The possibilities are nearly endless. And, most importantly, we have yet to find observations that can clearly differentiate between many of these competing theories. Essentially, we have no observationally verified theory of quantum gravity, which is necessary before we can make any real predictions of how the universe behaved in these early moments that are so essential to Hawking's arguments.So, if we take this into consideration, we can rephrase Stephen Hawking's brilliant deduction differently. IF we accept THIS theory of quantum gravity, together with its predictions about quantum fluctuations and the beginning of time, THEN the universe necessarily had no cause within our dimension of time, and thus, there is no God that exists solely within our universe's dimension of time. I believe that this is a valid deduction, and, to some extent, it should inform our understanding of God. It is only unfortunate that he didn't state his conclusions with this level of cautiousness. Instead, he is far more confident in his conclusions than is warranted by the data, and he leaves out the many ""if""s that should have preceded his conclusion. This was perhaps my only serious disagreement with the Book.And what of my own conclusions about God? That is not really what this review is about, but to be short:Theleologians in my chosen branch of Christianity have often said that God does not just predict the future, he quite literally sees it. For this to be the case, God must, of necessity, exist outside of our dimension of time, and likely outside of our dimensions of space as well. I find the fact that science is now predicting a universe of multiple dimensions and multiple universes (some with different laws of physics), and is finding that God cannot exist only within our dimension of time and still create the universe, to be quite faith promoting since that is in line with what I believed all along. Stephen Hawking would likely take issue with my interpretation of his work, but hey, that is what Science is all about, and we should be grateful to Stephen Hawking for so clearly expressing this brilliant deduction.

Did they manage to do so?, I doubt!Trying first to disqualify Philosophy saying it’s dead ( although mere advances started first from philosophers’ thinking -true or false- but it was just a start!, then building the meaning of reality ( which was basically philosophical at first, then continued by simple explanations of Quantum Physics and some other terms: ( 4 forces of nature, General relativity, Special relativity, QED, QCD & GUT). All that was good & easy to follow, while some other terms & principals were not that easy [Like: re-normalization, W+, W- & Z0 particles , or other philosophical descriptions(again) as creating history by our own observations rather than history creating us], the last model of creation (Game of life) & its shape models was quite difficult to fathom!The last 2 chapters were quite contradictory to each other, while in Chapter 7 “The Apparent Miracle” was in my opinion an evidence that this universe can’t be a result of a coincidence as in page 160 ( Change those rules of our universe just a bit, and the conditions for our existence disappear! ), Chapter 8 “The Grand Design “ page 179, claims arrogantly that ( we are the creators - we choose the initial state of the universe by specifying objects and their positions at the start of the game). Where were we when we started selecting all these laws & conditions?!! The weakest point in this book, that it didn’t describe well the theories that the M-theory consists of, hence when last phrase in the book confirms that this theory isn’t confirmed by observations, then it became totally vague to confirm the writers’ opinion at all!! "
208,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,5,"Hawking the man is gone now, but the influence of his intellect remains. In this book he explains why there is something rather than nothing, and whether that existence requires a deity to drive it. He simplifies to a great extent an extraordinarily complex subject, although without a working understanding of the necessary math, no lay person can truly claim to understand the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, string theory, or M-theory. Hawking certainly makes it possible for us to get a feel for the subject, though, without scaring us away with equations. If you want a lucid introduction to current theories of cosmology, read this book. And Hawking's wry humor infuses the text. "

210,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,2,"The blurb calls this a major work. It's not. I know I'm in a minority, but I am not a fan of Stephen Hawking as a popularizer. Undeniably, he is a major physicist, and I remember liking his Brief History of Time, but I read that a long time ago. His popular works since are all very oversimplified, and this one could almost be considered as a children's or YA book -- I would have no problem with it if it were marketed as such. But as an adult book, it covers no new ground which is not covered in more depth in many other popular science books.He begins by saying that ""philosophy is dead"", replaced by science. Okay, as someone with a degree in philosophy that may have prejudiced me to begin with. He then spends about 15% of this very short book giving a lightweight history of philosophy, not only oversimplified but full of errors. For example, he calls Thomas Aquinas an ""early Christian philosopher"" -- even if we consider modern philosophers who happen to be Christians as ""Christian philosophers"", he was past the middle, closer to today in time than to the real ""early Christian"" philosophers like Tertullian, Origen and Augustine. He calls Aristotle the leader in rejecting observational science -- actually he was probably the best observational scientist in antiquity, especially in his specialty of marine biology. He contrasts him to Galileo on the question of falling bodies -- probably it was Aristotle who actually experimented on this, dropping objects in liquid to slow them down and thereby discovering the laws of bodies at final velocity; while Galileo certainly never dropped the balls from the tower of Pisa -- he didn't have the instruments to prove anything that way anyway -- and whether he did the experiment with inclined planes is open to doubt (his first edition talks about rolling balls, which would have given very different results than he claimed; the later editions correct it to sliding blocks.)Hawking then moves to physics ""lite"", and while I'm not presumptuous enough to claim there were errors, it was certainly very oversimplified. His ""philosophy"" of ""model-dependent realism"" is presented very simplistically, without any consideration of the philosophical issues it raises. He gives very briefly all the standard analogies and examples which are in every book on relativity and quantum theory, from the two-slit experiment to the inflating balloon, and almost nothing which is not found everywhere else. The book is very short; the actual text, excluding the glossary, acknowledgements and index (there is no bibliography at all), is about 180 pages, of which 30 are either just chapter titles, blank, or ornamental illustrations. The font size is very large, and there are unnecessary large illustrations throughout, giving it the appearance of a children's book -- I know he has physical limitations on writing long books, and has more important things to work on, but it would have been more honest to write a short book than to pad it out to look longer than it is.Only the last ten or fifteen pages have anything which might be new to some people (but it's all in his earlier books) -- the no-boundary condition as a basis for the multiverse, very lightly explained. I was very disappointed in this book."
211,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13151041-manish-sinha,4,"This book isn't for beginners. They should first read more simpler books before starting with this one. The first few chapters of the book are relatively easy to understand and need just basic physics to understand. It assumed you remember concepts of physics like matter-wave-duality. It even assumes you have a basic knowledge of our view of universe some two hundred years back like we are in center of universe etc.The book contains beautiful graphical depictions and photos. It makes the book easy to read and to some extent interesting.This book asks a beautiful philosophical question ""What is reality?"". It explains that our knowledge of ""reality"" keeps on changing as we question ourselves and build our the scientific temper.Later on in the book Hawking uses more difficult terms like space-time and references to Feynman which some people might want to skip if they don't have a stronger physics background.One of the most interesting chapter is ""Choosing our Universe"". In that chapter he explains Creation myths in various cultures and traditions. Then he goes ahead and explains the big bang and how galaxies are expanding, terms like gravity well, space-time wrap etc.Explaining the book in more detail would act like a baaad spoiler. I guess my review did act a spoiler to some extent, but I would prefer to put it forward as a ""trailer"" to the beautiful journey of reading the book."

The book isn't documented and arguments aren't given at some key points. Hawking and Mlodinow also manage to make themselves look a little naive at times. For example, stating, in the very beginning of the book, that ""philosophy is dead"" and then going on to rest their entire theory on a (highly controversial) philosophical theory of model-dependent realism. Of course, Hawking is a huge authority in the eyes of the public, so the layperson will eat this stuff up, hook, line, and sinker. Unfortunately, I'm sure I'll be hearing about how Feynman's sum-over-histories proves the many worlds hypothesis for a long time my now, by people who really have no idea what exactly it is or how exactly it proves it.

I personally enjoy this topic, but can very easily see how folks not to keen on understanding many of the topics enclosed, can be stuck rereading many portions of the book. I went with 4 of 5 stars, as I am a tad disappointed that it seemed some questions were a little skirted around. Otherwise I found it very insightful and very fun. M-theory is a complex unified theory of essentially the makeup of everything, explained throughout this book with fun diagrams and medium difficulty explanations by one of the most brilliant minds of our time.Simply put, its a great read for those looking to venture into the beginning of the great scientific rabbit hole that is the understanding of why we all are here.""The fact that we human beings - who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature - have been able to come this close to an understanding of the laws governing us and our universe is a great triumph."" -pg 181"

216,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"As a longtime fan of the popular science books of the late Stephen Hawking it is nice to be able to extolled his book co-authorized by Leonard Mlodinow, The Grand Design. Because so much of this book is about quantum mechanics it can be hard on almost all readers. Advanced level readers will find it too basic and perhaps dislike the orientation/history that opens the book. Readers with little or no background should be relatively comfortable. For myself I remember the several versions of the statements made in this book. If you think you understand Quantum, you don’t. Or the better one: If thinking about Quantum mechanics does not blow your mind, then you do not understand it.Having read the book, I can say without shame that my mind is blown, but in a very positive way. The lack of lineal logic makes a logic of its own. I had been one to argue, loudly that ours is a world of cause and effect. Not fully appreciating I was stuck in a Newtonian world and behind by everything since before Einstein. The universe is much more likely: cause and most likely or probable effect. The various qualifiers “likely” and “probable” are deliberate and more in line with a host of things we now think we know and that call into question a lot about what we were certain we knew. Physics and math still rule but only up to a more or less predictable limit.A friend of mine, a Ph. D Physics and with profound religious beliefs once proposed that the space between cause and effect and cause and probable effect is where God can(?) express his/her will. He may be right.Two specific explanations in The Grand Design stand out as particularly enlightening. We are bound by our senses in what we can understand. If we are so many gold fishes living in gold fishbowls, our view of the universe would be of a more curved and less linear universe. Our models of the universe would reflect our experience of relating to the universe through the distortion of the gold fish bowl. It would be unlikely that any experiment we designed or results we generated could be controlled for the limits on our ability to comprehend our model of the universe. It is therefore just as likely that as humans we are bound to the universe we are in and unable to build experiments beyond the limits of this particular universe. Could we escape the limits of the models we can imagine and the limits on reading our test results, it may be that we could close the gap in the in the probable side of cause and effect, or we might just find new ways to reach the same limitationsAgainst those who write science fiction based on the notion that there are other universes, and play with the variations possible in a ‘mega’ universe of unlimited alternate universes, Hawking and Mlodinow limit the number of possible universes to something like 1 *10 to the 100th power. So we are in one of a google-plex of possible worlds and that number can vary as some will be less stable than others. Creating an ongoing cycle of new ones from the matter and energy of the less stable.On a more specific level, I had never had much respect for Feynman’s concept of sum over histories. That any given time particles take every possible path to where ever they are finally detected. Rather like one of us buying tickets from LA to Las Vegas via every possible combination of flights that leave the LA Airport in any given time but ultimately connect to the McCarran International Airport in North Vegas. Nevermind the problem of us being in several airplanes at the same time. Quantum allows for that, or something like it; who among us has at the sub atomic or economic level has that much energy or that much money? Via the illustrations and the rest, I think I almost get that in the sum over histories, some possibilities cancel out others with the results favoring only a few probabilities. So that maybe LA to Bakersfield to Las Vegas makes some kind of sense and therefore has some probability; while LA to Hong Kong to Atlanta, back to San Francisco and then to Vegas, not as much.Having read other Stephen Hawking’s books before, The Grand Design has some very high quality illustrations and some wonderful cartoons. In the cartoons I detect the famous Hawking’s wit but in the great and greatly helpful illustrations I speculate that I see the previously unknown (to me) hand of Leonard Mlodinow.Once again a relatively readable book. Perhaps better for the sometime dabbler in physics and less so for the serious student. In my day we had college classes affectionately known as Physics for poets. The Grand Design might be perfect for that reader."

It is a thought-provoking and a fascinating journey that makes us meditate and question our deepest convictions. Thanks to this book, I had a glance at the amazing world of modern physics that I couldn't find anywhere else since all the documentries that claim explaining those concepts do nothing but mystifying us even more.Though it is a pro-atheist assay, the scientific concepts are well explained and nicely illustrated. What we know today about our universe is amazingly puzzling ! Scientific theories are now based on mathematics so advanced that they no longer agree with our everyday experience, and it makes them hard to imagine. Space, time, the cause-and-effect principle and other corner stones of our reasoning are twisted and sometimes abandoned in modern physics. Though the authour doesn't see any other miracle in all of these phenomena but the maths and us wodering about it, I see miracles everywhere ! "
218,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54949416-najmi-ayob,5,"A great book, provocative yet amazing. This book is proposing M-theory (a candidate for the TOE) but it does so gracefully. One does not simply shove quantum physics and the questions of laws of nature so easily at people. To introduce ""heavy"" concepts, the authors infused the appropriate amount of relatable humours. The authors also beautifully picked up human histories that reflects each modern achievement in physics, which is very interesting to look at. This is indeed the first time I have ever smile and laughed at a book about quantum physics. Oh Lord, I love the language. It is so easy to understand the language yet it is by no means superficial. It is as grand as its title. I would suggest all science students to make this book a compulsory reading, for its ways of argument and logic will be very helpful. It is also helpful for those who are practicing to communicate the sciences. Science in this book, is very well-communicated."

I have read a fair bit of science history so those parts of the book I already knew and understood (mostly). But when it comes to the actuall science I have no idea. I recognise a fair bit of it from earlier readings, but recognition and understanding is two compleatly different things. Then again, can you understand modern physics? You can understand the math, the experiments and the applications. But can you really grasp what it means? As a monkey from the grass plains of Africa. “If you are not completely confused by quantum mechanics, you do not understand it” as one physisist put it. And I am both confused and I dont understand it. But that is not the fault of this book, its me and (I am pretty sure) my evoultionary history. Planck scale makes no sense. The big numbers in this book makes no sense. My brain has not evolved to grasp these concepts. And I dont think anyones have. But if you have the math, at least you can get a theoretical understanding of it. I have no idea if the M-theory is the right one, no one seems to do, so I Guess we will have to wait another 20-30 years and see what they find out. "

There were many jokes snuck into the writing, some reminding me strongly of A Series of Unfortunate Events (paraphrased from this book: symmetrical like a doughnut, unless one side has chocolate topping in which case it would be better to eat it.) The jokes could be odd or incongruous but were not dwelt upon which gave them an added charm of just being snuck in. The philosophical nature of the books ideas, and how easily points could be applied outside of science did well at grabbing my imagination."

""The Grand Design"" is one of the most ambitious books ever written by one of the world's great thinkers. It attempts to answer the ultimate questions of life through science. The ultimate question of course and the title of this book, is the apparent grand design offer proof for a supernatural designer. This fascinating 208-page book, is composed of the following eight chapters: 1. The Mystery of Being, 2. The Rule of Law, 3. What Is Reality, 4. Alternative Histories, 5. The Theory of Everything, 6. Choosing Our Universe, 7. The Apparent Miracle, and 8. The Grand Design. Positives: 1. An ambitious book that is well-written, well-researched and concise. 2. Surprisingly accessible book that is profound without being unintelligible. 3. Evenhanded, respectful tone throughout. 4. In essence, a modern update to life's biggest questions. 5. No complex mathematical equations to worry about, elegant prose was used to convey concepts. 6. Great use of illustrations. 7. This book is in essence about the M-theory Network. What phenomena it describes and what are the limitations. 8. Thought-provoking book indeed and fascinating quotes, ""Ignorance of nature's ways led people in ancient times to invent gods to lord it over every aspect of human life"". 9. An interesting look at the history of scientific inquiry. 10. Fascinating tidbits throughout. 11. The debunking of free will. 12. The explanation of what constitutes an effective theory in physics. 13. Model-dependent realism defined. Very interesting. 14. The explanation of what quantum physics really is. 15. Special and general relativity in context. 16. The search for quantum versions of the laws of physics. 17. The never-ending quest for the theory of everything. 18. The history of the ""big bang"". 19. A clear explanation of what we do know versus what we don't know. 20. The realization that time behaves like space... 21. The anthropic principles defined. 22. The triple alpha process...who knew? 23. The multiverse concept defined and how it can explain the fine-tuning of physical laws. 24. Spontaneous creation. 25. A much needed glossary of terms. Negatives: 1. Will disappoint the more scientifically minded as this book was written for the masses. 2. This is an accessible book by design but the nature of physics is so complex that it will still leave some readers dumfounded. 3. The book's hype may have lead some readers with the wrong impression and thus not satisfied with the end result. 4. I think some readers expected new groundbreaking ideas (and please correct me if I'm wrong) but in reality it's a book that provides the latest in scientific knowledge and future aspirations. 5. Philosophy is still alive and well. 6. He has yet to find the Holy Grail of Physics. In other words, the book feels incomplete because it is. In summary, this is a very solid concise book but it doesn't ultimately answer all the questions and will leave those readers with higher albeit unreasonable expectations with a degree of dissatisfaction. It's a book meant for the masses and in that respect accomplishes what it sought out to do. However, for those with higher physics acumen this book as evidenced by the reviews from readers who hold Hawking in high regard, it will be disappointing. If you are a layperson this book is a worthwhile read, on the other hand wait for a more advanced edition or book. Recommendations: ""Physics of the Future"" by Michio Kaku, ""The Age of Everything"" by Mathew Hedman, and ""The Elegant Universe"" by Brian Greene."

225,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256070-jose,2,"I think this book deserves one star but I can't bring myself to give that rating to a book by the great Stephen Hawking. I don't even know where to start... if you read A Brief History of Time just reread that. That book is light years ahead and I honestly thought maybe this one was meant for adolescents. There is some interesting discussion in the beginning about the nature of physical models but it is quickly abandoned. Ok that's fine, bring on the ""real"" science right? Wrong. In fact the entire book rushes through topics quickly and unsatisfyingly. There are a few nuggets but for a book that I read in just 3 QUICK sittings this is not enough. I did like reading it but it was all stuff I had seen before and to better depth. Maybe I just came with too high of expectations.The book claims to offer answers to the BIG questions. If you didn't know much about modern physics and saw this get ready for a big disappointment. Surprise! science doesn't know why the universe came into existence. It also doesn't know why the universe has the laws it does have. The book claims it is because there are many universes and we happen to be in one with ""good"" laws. Does that pass anybody's BS test? In fact, upon my reading it's hard not to conclude that current physics is pretty utterly lost. I don't know how Mr. Hawking can think string theory is anything more than a giant math trick. Physical theories have to be experimentally grounded and M Theory is a joke. By the way, it is barely, barely defined here! Not even the traditional high level description of it. I'm sorry but when our best unified physical theory for the universe calls for the existence of an enormous amount of parallel universes and is untestable... it is worthless. "
226,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5496860-julie-shennan,1,"THE problem with Stephen Hawking’s creation theory is it’s not his theory. His latest novel The Grand Design paraphrases every scientific, religious and mythological hypothesis of the universe, except his own. After 180 pages of mind numbing reading, I reached the conclusion, hoping beyond hope, this would be Hawking’s big revelation. Alas, it wasn’t, instead he said, ‘the M - theory is the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe’...That would be Edward Witten’s M Theory. What is this M Theory? Well, I got the impression that it was just a combination of theories which offered a spatial reading of creation, no pun intended. These theories outline that cosmos aren’t linear so don’t have a set matter, place, era or event in which they started, such as the creation of our universe. The theories also state multiple universes were created at the same time, with different environments and natural laws.Hawkins argues this spatial reading of creation clashes with the Christian First Cause Theory, because it suggests that there was never a blank canvas for God to create life from. He also claims that the simultaneous creation of multiple universes suggest that our planet is not unique in its hospitable climate, and so was not created especially for us, as the Grand Design theory suggests.Yet, Hawkins critique of Christianity is unoriginal, and with no evidence to further Edward Witten’s theory I can’t help but think if The Grand Design were a dissertation, it would merit a fail."
227,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45877282-jeffrey-debris,5,"It's almost impossible to imagine that Stephen Hawking has passed away. He was one of our brightest minds and reading this book has changed the way I perceive reality in quite a few ways. The book starts with this sentence: ""We each exist for but a short time, and in that time explore but a small part of the whole universe."" Given just how mindbogglingly big our universe is, this sentence hit home right away for me.Hawking then goes on to inspire us, by saying that the Human species is a curious one, in constant search of answers to questions. This book aims to answer a couple of the great ones in our lives. What is reality? Does God exist? Does a multiverse exist?Each chapter in this wonderful book aims at giving an answer to these important questions. Hawking lays it all out in front of the reader in language that even the layman (like me) can understand. He does so with a smooth writing style and a touch of humour, which keeps things a bit lighter than they really are.This is one of those books you really want to have in your collection for more than one reason. It aims to explain, but it will also spark your imagination, and make you want to learn more about our universe. I will definitely pick this one up again at some time, simply to remind myself just how brilliant a mind Stephen Hawking had and how science can possibly be our greatest hope of survival in this crazy, chaotic world we live in."
228,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,3,"Hawking is a terrific self-promoter, and he managed to grab a lot of headlines for this book by claiming he'd killed God or whatever, but the truth is there's very little in this book that Brian Greene didn't cover - and cover better - ten years ago. In fact, a lot of this is stuff Hawking himself has covered in A Brief History of Time.In the last chapter he brings up Conway and Turing and things get significantly more interesting, but it's too late by that time, since Hawking apparently feels he can't publish a book of more than 200 pages. I felt like we were at the start of something interesting there; I would've liked to hear more about it.In general, this confirms that I'm not a big fan of Hawking. He bills himself as ""science explained for the masses,"" but he doesn't actually explain things all that well - or, at least, there are folks who can explain it better. And in trying to cover so much in his books, he ends up covering nothing well enough."
229,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12508032-jyotsna,2,"Actual rating: 2.5 starsI kind of have mixed feelings about this book. What I did not like: This is a book by physicists for physicists. Being an engineer and having had a good interest in physics, the book was easier to read, but if any person with no background of physics picked this up, they would be totally lost! This book is not for the masses, it purely talks to those intellectuals in the science field. What I liked: The good explanation of physics and mainly theoretical physics as a whole. I liked the breakdown of various theories from Newtonian physics to Quantum physics.  The idea of attempting to explain the universe in a scientific manner does work as the writers assume that you have to go from A to Z and not feed you the intermediate steps directly. In short, a well organised book.Conclusion: Only read if you are actually aware of basic physics. Otherwise, you may not enjoy it that much."
230,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/651858-george-musser,2,"Frankly I found the book incoherent. It argues on the one hand that a final theory of physics is unattainable, because there's no objective way to decide among competing theories (a position they call ""model-dependent realism""), and on the other hand, it says that physicists have found such a theory: M-theory. The authors do not acknowledge this apparent contradiction, let alone explain how it might be resolved. (I personally think it can be done, but shouldn't the authors do this for us?) Crucial concepts, such as why M-theory should be taken as the final theory to begin with, are hardly explained, and the authors present model-dependent realism as though it were their own brainchild, not acknowledging the work of Poincare, Bohr, and the positivists."
231,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3657860-bob-finch,3,"The first half of the book was reasonably well presented, albeit very brief (most non-specialists would benefit from a lot more more background), but the remainder left me wanting. This is not a book for scientists, and unless the reader is willing to accept all that is said at face value, trying to find supporting information within these pages is largely futile (the motivated reader might search for such support elsewhere). And the punch line, that M-Theory (undefined) may answer all questions about the origins and nature of the physical universe, is pretty much left undeveloped. The book is nevertheless interesting if only to glean a bit of insight into some (pretty counter-intuitive) alternative explanations of reality. "

I think this was just the book to do it. It is written in a clear, accessible style with hints of humor.

He begins with basic principles and builds from there so the reader has a base from which to begin. Gravity is a focus. Terms are defined at the end. Antimatter is discussed as well as the expansion of the universe. I need to break down and just buy all of his books. "
235,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/623492-ayla,4,Fascinating audiobook on the universe and everything. 42! No wrong answer lol . Fun little book keeping with the simple layman explanation that Hawking did brilliantly. 
236,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162048-james-carroll,4,"""Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge."" Stephen HawkingI couldn't agree with that statement more. Some of his other conclusions in the book from which the quote was taken ""The Grand Design""... not so much.But in what way is philosophy dead? Clearly the love of wisdom is not dead, but it may well be that the field of liberal arts philosophy may indeed be dead (or at least loosing relevance and productivity). To attempt to discover the real truth requires more than sitting and thinking, it requires observation, and then modeling, which requires math. This means that today the mathematicians and physicists are doing the real leg work of philosophy, while the liberal arts philosophers are, for the most part, spinning their wheels. There is a feeling that theology and philosophy should be the ones asking the questions about morality, theology, meaning, and God, while science should keep its distance. But I believe that you can't ask these questions correctly without a firm grounding in the observations of science and physics, which MUST inform any inquiry into philosophy, or even theology. As Einstein said, science without theology is lame (in the sense of not having the power to move things forward), while theology without science is blind (in the sense of moving forward, but not seeing where it is really going). Therefore, I find that I simply can not agree with those that say that science should leave such theological matters to religion. In my view, Stephen Hawking has every right to venture into the field of theology, and to bravely see what implications his understanding of the laws of physics has on his understanding of God. This is a useful and potentially very productive undertaking.Let us take some of Hawking's conclusions in this book as an example, and see how science can inform theology:1. In the beginning, the world was very small, thus the rules of Quantum Mechanics hold, and things like the universe can (and indeed will) appear out of nothing without violating the rules of quantum mechanics, so long as it eventually cancels itself out, just as virtual particles usually do.2. The universe has an equal amount of positive and negative energy, and so is a cosmic free lunch, and can (and will) appear out of nothing (essentially, the universe cancels itself out, much like virtual particles do).3. But the universe was also hugely massive, so it followed not only the rules of quantum mechanics, but also the rules of relativity, which says that mass bends space and time, and at the point where you have enough mass to make a black hole (as we clearly had in the early universe), time itself stops, so there IS no time before the big bang, time curves back upon itself, and comes to a single closed point, creating a beginning not only of the universe, but of time itself, and thus it creates a beginning to the chain of causation. The chain of causation (where the causes come before the results) comes to an end at the Big bang, which necessarily had no cause, because there was no time before the big bang for that cause to act in. His conclusion? There is no God in the platonic sense of the ""prime mover"" or ""first cause"" because 1. we don't need him to explain how and why the universe could come into being, (quantum mechanics does that) and 2. there could be no creator of the universe, because there was no time before the universe was created for Him to act in. Essentially, God could not ""cause"" the universe, because relativity guarantees that there was no time in which he could act to initiate such a cause, and after the big bang bangs, we don't need Him to explain the progression of the universe from that point on (the laws of nature do that). Whether or not you agree with these conclusions (which I do not), it is clear that a firm understanding of the issues surrounding quantum mechanics should indeed necessarily inform our theology. Even if his reasoning here is flawed, that is the way science works. It is necessary for someone to make these sorts of inferences, so that science can move forward and either prove or disprove this theory.So, why don't I come to the same conclusions as Hawking? His reasoning appears rather solid at first glance. However, relativity and quantum mechanics are notorious for their inability to play nicely together, and there are a myriad of potential theories that have been proposed in an attempt to produce a good theory of quantum gravity. He is here espousing one of these theories, granted, it is the one that is (so far) the most mathematically robust, but it is by no means the only solution to this problem. For example, some theories of quantized time predict a big bounce instead of a big bang, in which case there was indeed time before the big bang. Another competing theory predicts that two of the membranes predicted by M-theory collided, producing the big bang, again, this is a theory that predicts time before the big bang. Still other theories predict that there are other dimensions of time, outside of our own. It is also unclear to some whether quantum fluctuations can create virtual particles without space or time in which to create them, which could cast doubt on whether a quantum fluctuation alone could create the universe from no-where and no-when. The possibilities are nearly endless. And, most importantly, we have yet to find observations that can clearly differentiate between many of these competing theories. Essentially, we have no observationally verified theory of quantum gravity, which is necessary before we can make any real predictions of how the universe behaved in these early moments that are so essential to Hawking's arguments.So, if we take this into consideration, we can rephrase Stephen Hawking's brilliant deduction differently. IF we accept THIS theory of quantum gravity, together with its predictions about quantum fluctuations and the beginning of time, THEN the universe necessarily had no cause within our dimension of time, and thus, there is no God that exists solely within our universe's dimension of time. I believe that this is a valid deduction, and, to some extent, it should inform our understanding of God. It is only unfortunate that he didn't state his conclusions with this level of cautiousness. Instead, he is far more confident in his conclusions than is warranted by the data, and he leaves out the many ""if""s that should have preceded his conclusion. This was perhaps my only serious disagreement with the Book.And what of my own conclusions about God? That is not really what this review is about, but to be short:Theleologians in my chosen branch of Christianity have often said that God does not just predict the future, he quite literally sees it. For this to be the case, God must, of necessity, exist outside of our dimension of time, and likely outside of our dimensions of space as well. I find the fact that science is now predicting a universe of multiple dimensions and multiple universes (some with different laws of physics), and is finding that God cannot exist only within our dimension of time and still create the universe, to be quite faith promoting since that is in line with what I believed all along. Stephen Hawking would likely take issue with my interpretation of his work, but hey, that is what Science is all about, and we should be grateful to Stephen Hawking for so clearly expressing this brilliant deduction.

237,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176602-shaimaa-ali,3,"In this book, both scientists (Hawking & Mlodinow) tried to explore an answer to so many existential questions.. “why do we exist?, why is there something rather than nothing?, why this particular set of laws and not some other?” .. in general, they tried to answer why the universe behave this way, not only to describe how .. Did they manage to do so?, I doubt!Trying first to disqualify Philosophy saying it’s dead ( although mere advances started first from philosophers’ thinking -true or false- but it was just a start!, then building the meaning of reality ( which was basically philosophical at first, then continued by simple explanations of Quantum Physics and some other terms: ( 4 forces of nature, General relativity, Special relativity, QED, QCD & GUT). All that was good & easy to follow, while some other terms & principals were not that easy [Like: re-normalization, W+, W- & Z0 particles , or other philosophical descriptions(again) as creating history by our own observations rather than history creating us], the last model of creation (Game of life) & its shape models was quite difficult to fathom!The last 2 chapters were quite contradictory to each other, while in Chapter 7 “The Apparent Miracle” was in my opinion an evidence that this universe can’t be a result of a coincidence as in page 160 ( Change those rules of our universe just a bit, and the conditions for our existence disappear! ), Chapter 8 “The Grand Design “ page 179, claims arrogantly that ( we are the creators - we choose the initial state of the universe by specifying objects and their positions at the start of the game). Where were we when we started selecting all these laws & conditions?!! The weakest point in this book, that it didn’t describe well the theories that the M-theory consists of, hence when last phrase in the book confirms that this theory isn’t confirmed by observations, then it became totally vague to confirm the writers’ opinion at all!!

238,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,5,"Hawking the man is gone now, but the influence of his intellect remains. In this book he explains why there is something rather than nothing, and whether that existence requires a deity to drive it. He simplifies to a great extent an extraordinarily complex subject, although without a working understanding of the necessary math, no lay person can truly claim to understand the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, string theory, or M-theory. Hawking certainly makes it possible for us to get a feel for the subject, though, without scaring us away with equations. If you want a lucid introduction to current theories of cosmology, read this book. And Hawking's wry humor infuses the text. "

240,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,2,"The blurb calls this a major work. It's not. I know I'm in a minority, but I am not a fan of Stephen Hawking as a popularizer. Undeniably, he is a major physicist, and I remember liking his Brief History of Time, but I read that a long time ago. His popular works since are all very oversimplified, and this one could almost be considered as a children's or YA book -- I would have no problem with it if it were marketed as such. But as an adult book, it covers no new ground which is not covered in more depth in many other popular science books.He begins by saying that ""philosophy is dead"", replaced by science. Okay, as someone with a degree in philosophy that may have prejudiced me to begin with. He then spends about 15% of this very short book giving a lightweight history of philosophy, not only oversimplified but full of errors. For example, he calls Thomas Aquinas an ""early Christian philosopher"" -- even if we consider modern philosophers who happen to be Christians as ""Christian philosophers"", he was past the middle, closer to today in time than to the real ""early Christian"" philosophers like Tertullian, Origen and Augustine. He calls Aristotle the leader in rejecting observational science -- actually he was probably the best observational scientist in antiquity, especially in his specialty of marine biology. He contrasts him to Galileo on the question of falling bodies -- probably it was Aristotle who actually experimented on this, dropping objects in liquid to slow them down and thereby discovering the laws of bodies at final velocity; while Galileo certainly never dropped the balls from the tower of Pisa -- he didn't have the instruments to prove anything that way anyway -- and whether he did the experiment with inclined planes is open to doubt (his first edition talks about rolling balls, which would have given very different results than he claimed; the later editions correct it to sliding blocks.)Hawking then moves to physics ""lite"", and while I'm not presumptuous enough to claim there were errors, it was certainly very oversimplified. His ""philosophy"" of ""model-dependent realism"" is presented very simplistically, without any consideration of the philosophical issues it raises. He gives very briefly all the standard analogies and examples which are in every book on relativity and quantum theory, from the two-slit experiment to the inflating balloon, and almost nothing which is not found everywhere else. The book is very short; the actual text, excluding the glossary, acknowledgements and index (there is no bibliography at all), is about 180 pages, of which 30 are either just chapter titles, blank, or ornamental illustrations. The font size is very large, and there are unnecessary large illustrations throughout, giving it the appearance of a children's book -- I know he has physical limitations on writing long books, and has more important things to work on, but it would have been more honest to write a short book than to pad it out to look longer than it is.Only the last ten or fifteen pages have anything which might be new to some people (but it's all in his earlier books) -- the no-boundary condition as a basis for the multiverse, very lightly explained. I was very disappointed in this book."
241,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13151041-manish-sinha,4,"This book isn't for beginners. They should first read more simpler books before starting with this one. The first few chapters of the book are relatively easy to understand and need just basic physics to understand. It assumed you remember concepts of physics like matter-wave-duality. It even assumes you have a basic knowledge of our view of universe some two hundred years back like we are in center of universe etc.The book contains beautiful graphical depictions and photos. It makes the book easy to read and to some extent interesting.This book asks a beautiful philosophical question ""What is reality?"". It explains that our knowledge of ""reality"" keeps on changing as we question ourselves and build our the scientific temper.Later on in the book Hawking uses more difficult terms like space-time and references to Feynman which some people might want to skip if they don't have a stronger physics background.One of the most interesting chapter is ""Choosing our Universe"". In that chapter he explains Creation myths in various cultures and traditions. Then he goes ahead and explains the big bang and how galaxies are expanding, terms like gravity well, space-time wrap etc.Explaining the book in more detail would act like a baaad spoiler. I guess my review did act a spoiler to some extent, but I would prefer to put it forward as a ""trailer"" to the beautiful journey of reading the book."

Of course, Hawking is a huge authority in the eyes of the public, so the layperson will eat this stuff up, hook, line, and sinker.

246,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"As a longtime fan of the popular science books of the late Stephen Hawking it is nice to be able to extolled his book co-authorized by Leonard Mlodinow, The Grand Design. Because so much of this book is about quantum mechanics it can be hard on almost all readers. Advanced level readers will find it too basic and perhaps dislike the orientation/history that opens the book. Readers with little or no background should be relatively comfortable. For myself I remember the several versions of the statements made in this book. If you think you understand Quantum, you don’t. Or the better one: If thinking about Quantum mechanics does not blow your mind, then you do not understand it.Having read the book, I can say without shame that my mind is blown, but in a very positive way. The lack of lineal logic makes a logic of its own. I had been one to argue, loudly that ours is a world of cause and effect. Not fully appreciating I was stuck in a Newtonian world and behind by everything since before Einstein. The universe is much more likely: cause and most likely or probable effect. The various qualifiers “likely” and “probable” are deliberate and more in line with a host of things we now think we know and that call into question a lot about what we were certain we knew. Physics and math still rule but only up to a more or less predictable limit.A friend of mine, a Ph. D Physics and with profound religious beliefs once proposed that the space between cause and effect and cause and probable effect is where God can(?) express his/her will. He may be right.Two specific explanations in The Grand Design stand out as particularly enlightening. We are bound by our senses in what we can understand. If we are so many gold fishes living in gold fishbowls, our view of the universe would be of a more curved and less linear universe. Our models of the universe would reflect our experience of relating to the universe through the distortion of the gold fish bowl. It would be unlikely that any experiment we designed or results we generated could be controlled for the limits on our ability to comprehend our model of the universe. It is therefore just as likely that as humans we are bound to the universe we are in and unable to build experiments beyond the limits of this particular universe. Could we escape the limits of the models we can imagine and the limits on reading our test results, it may be that we could close the gap in the in the probable side of cause and effect, or we might just find new ways to reach the same limitationsAgainst those who write science fiction based on the notion that there are other universes, and play with the variations possible in a ‘mega’ universe of unlimited alternate universes, Hawking and Mlodinow limit the number of possible universes to something like 1 *10 to the 100th power. So we are in one of a google-plex of possible worlds and that number can vary as some will be less stable than others. Creating an ongoing cycle of new ones from the matter and energy of the less stable.On a more specific level, I had never had much respect for Feynman’s concept of sum over histories. That any given time particles take every possible path to where ever they are finally detected. Rather like one of us buying tickets from LA to Las Vegas via every possible combination of flights that leave the LA Airport in any given time but ultimately connect to the McCarran International Airport in North Vegas. Nevermind the problem of us being in several airplanes at the same time. Quantum allows for that, or something like it; who among us has at the sub atomic or economic level has that much energy or that much money? Via the illustrations and the rest, I think I almost get that in the sum over histories, some possibilities cancel out others with the results favoring only a few probabilities. So that maybe LA to Bakersfield to Las Vegas makes some kind of sense and therefore has some probability; while LA to Hong Kong to Atlanta, back to San Francisco and then to Vegas, not as much.Having read other Stephen Hawking’s books before, The Grand Design has some very high quality illustrations and some wonderful cartoons. In the cartoons I detect the famous Hawking’s wit but in the great and greatly helpful illustrations I speculate that I see the previously unknown (to me) hand of Leonard Mlodinow.Once again a relatively readable book. Perhaps better for the sometime dabbler in physics and less so for the serious student. In my day we had college classes affectionately known as Physics for poets. The Grand Design might be perfect for that reader."

It is a thought-provoking and a fascinating journey that makes us meditate and question our deepest convictions. Thanks to this book, I had a glance at the amazing world of modern physics that I couldn't find anywhere else since all the documentries that claim explaining those concepts do nothing but mystifying us even more.Though it is a pro-atheist assay, the scientific concepts are well explained and nicely illustrated. What we know today about our universe is amazingly puzzling ! Scientific theories are now based on mathematics so advanced that they no longer agree with our everyday experience, and it makes them hard to imagine. Space, time, the cause-and-effect principle and other corner stones of our reasoning are twisted and sometimes abandoned in modern physics. Though the authour doesn't see any other miracle in all of these phenomena but the maths and us wodering about it, I see miracles everywhere ! "

One does not simply shove quantum physics and the questions of laws of nature so easily at people. To introduce ""heavy"" concepts, the authors infused the appropriate amount of relatable humours. The authors also beautifully picked up human histories that reflects each modern achievement in physics, which is very interesting to look at. This is indeed the first time I have ever smile and laughed at a book about quantum physics. Oh Lord, I love the language. It is so easy to understand the language yet it is by no means superficial. It is as grand as its title. I would suggest all science students to make this book a compulsory reading, for its ways of argument and logic will be very helpful. It is also helpful for those who are practicing to communicate the sciences. Science in this book, is very well-communicated."

I have read a fair bit of science history so those parts of the book I already knew and understood (mostly). But when it comes to the actuall science I have no idea. I recognise a fair bit of it from earlier readings, but recognition and understanding is two compleatly different things. Then again, can you understand modern physics? You can understand the math, the experiments and the applications. But can you really grasp what it means? As a monkey from the grass plains of Africa. “If you are not completely confused by quantum mechanics, you do not understand it” as one physisist put it. And I am both confused and I dont understand it. But that is not the fault of this book, its me and (I am pretty sure) my evoultionary history. Planck scale makes no sense. The big numbers in this book makes no sense. My brain has not evolved to grasp these concepts. And I dont think anyones have. But if you have the math, at least you can get a theoretical understanding of it.

""The Grand Design"" is one of the most ambitious books ever written by one of the world's great thinkers. It attempts to answer the ultimate questions of life through science. The ultimate question of course and the title of this book, is the apparent grand design offer proof for a supernatural designer. This fascinating 208-page book, is composed of the following eight chapters: 1. The Mystery of Being, 2. The Rule of Law, 3. What Is Reality, 4. Alternative Histories, 5. The Theory of Everything, 6. Choosing Our Universe, 7. The Apparent Miracle, and 8. The Grand Design. Positives: 1. An ambitious book that is well-written, well-researched and concise. 2. Surprisingly accessible book that is profound without being unintelligible. 3. Evenhanded, respectful tone throughout. 4. In essence, a modern update to life's biggest questions. 5. No complex mathematical equations to worry about, elegant prose was used to convey concepts. 6. Great use of illustrations. 7. This book is in essence about the M-theory Network. What phenomena it describes and what are the limitations. 8. Thought-provoking book indeed and fascinating quotes, ""Ignorance of nature's ways led people in ancient times to invent gods to lord it over every aspect of human life"". 9. An interesting look at the history of scientific inquiry. 10. Fascinating tidbits throughout. 11. The debunking of free will. 12. The explanation of what constitutes an effective theory in physics. 13. Model-dependent realism defined. Very interesting. 14. The explanation of what quantum physics really is. 15. Special and general relativity in context. 16. The search for quantum versions of the laws of physics. 17. The never-ending quest for the theory of everything. 18. The history of the ""big bang"". 19. A clear explanation of what we do know versus what we don't know. 20. The realization that time behaves like space... 21. The anthropic principles defined. 22. The triple alpha process...who knew? 23. The multiverse concept defined and how it can explain the fine-tuning of physical laws. 24. Spontaneous creation. 25. A much needed glossary of terms. Negatives: 1. Will disappoint the more scientifically minded as this book was written for the masses. 2. This is an accessible book by design but the nature of physics is so complex that it will still leave some readers dumfounded. 3. The book's hype may have lead some readers with the wrong impression and thus not satisfied with the end result. 4. I think some readers expected new groundbreaking ideas (and please correct me if I'm wrong) but in reality it's a book that provides the latest in scientific knowledge and future aspirations. 5. Philosophy is still alive and well. 6. He has yet to find the Holy Grail of Physics. In other words, the book feels incomplete because it is. In summary, this is a very solid concise book but it doesn't ultimately answer all the questions and will leave those readers with higher albeit unreasonable expectations with a degree of dissatisfaction. It's a book meant for the masses and in that respect accomplishes what it sought out to do. However, for those with higher physics acumen this book as evidenced by the reviews from readers who hold Hawking in high regard, it will be disappointing. If you are a layperson this book is a worthwhile read, on the other hand wait for a more advanced edition or book.

255,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256070-jose,2,"I think this book deserves one star but I can't bring myself to give that rating to a book by the great Stephen Hawking. I don't even know where to start... if you read A Brief History of Time just reread that. That book is light years ahead and I honestly thought maybe this one was meant for adolescents. There is some interesting discussion in the beginning about the nature of physical models but it is quickly abandoned. Ok that's fine, bring on the ""real"" science right? Wrong. In fact the entire book rushes through topics quickly and unsatisfyingly. There are a few nuggets but for a book that I read in just 3 QUICK sittings this is not enough. I did like reading it but it was all stuff I had seen before and to better depth. Maybe I just came with too high of expectations.The book claims to offer answers to the BIG questions. If you didn't know much about modern physics and saw this get ready for a big disappointment. Surprise! science doesn't know why the universe came into existence. It also doesn't know why the universe has the laws it does have. The book claims it is because there are many universes and we happen to be in one with ""good"" laws. Does that pass anybody's BS test? In fact, upon my reading it's hard not to conclude that current physics is pretty utterly lost. I don't know how Mr. Hawking can think string theory is anything more than a giant math trick. Physical theories have to be experimentally grounded and M Theory is a joke. By the way, it is barely, barely defined here! Not even the traditional high level description of it. I'm sorry but when our best unified physical theory for the universe calls for the existence of an enormous amount of parallel universes and is untestable... it is worthless. "
256,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5496860-julie-shennan,1,"THE problem with Stephen Hawking’s creation theory is it’s not his theory. His latest novel The Grand Design paraphrases every scientific, religious and mythological hypothesis of the universe, except his own. After 180 pages of mind numbing reading, I reached the conclusion, hoping beyond hope, this would be Hawking’s big revelation. Alas, it wasn’t, instead he said, ‘the M - theory is the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe’...That would be Edward Witten’s M Theory. What is this M Theory? Well, I got the impression that it was just a combination of theories which offered a spatial reading of creation, no pun intended. These theories outline that cosmos aren’t linear so don’t have a set matter, place, era or event in which they started, such as the creation of our universe. The theories also state multiple universes were created at the same time, with different environments and natural laws.Hawkins argues this spatial reading of creation clashes with the Christian First Cause Theory, because it suggests that there was never a blank canvas for God to create life from. He also claims that the simultaneous creation of multiple universes suggest that our planet is not unique in its hospitable climate, and so was not created especially for us, as the Grand Design theory suggests.Yet, Hawkins critique of Christianity is unoriginal, and with no evidence to further Edward Witten’s theory I can’t help but think if The Grand Design were a dissertation, it would merit a fail."
257,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45877282-jeffrey-debris,5,"It's almost impossible to imagine that Stephen Hawking has passed away. He was one of our brightest minds and reading this book has changed the way I perceive reality in quite a few ways. The book starts with this sentence: ""We each exist for but a short time, and in that time explore but a small part of the whole universe."" Given just how mindbogglingly big our universe is, this sentence hit home right away for me.Hawking then goes on to inspire us, by saying that the Human species is a curious one, in constant search of answers to questions. This book aims to answer a couple of the great ones in our lives. What is reality? Does God exist? Does a multiverse exist?Each chapter in this wonderful book aims at giving an answer to these important questions. Hawking lays it all out in front of the reader in language that even the layman (like me) can understand. He does so with a smooth writing style and a touch of humour, which keeps things a bit lighter than they really are.This is one of those books you really want to have in your collection for more than one reason. It aims to explain, but it will also spark your imagination, and make you want to learn more about our universe. I will definitely pick this one up again at some time, simply to remind myself just how brilliant a mind Stephen Hawking had and how science can possibly be our greatest hope of survival in this crazy, chaotic world we live in."
258,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,3,"Hawking is a terrific self-promoter, and he managed to grab a lot of headlines for this book by claiming he'd killed God or whatever, but the truth is there's very little in this book that Brian Greene didn't cover - and cover better - ten years ago. In fact, a lot of this is stuff Hawking himself has covered in A Brief History of Time.In the last chapter he brings up Conway and Turing and things get significantly more interesting, but it's too late by that time, since Hawking apparently feels he can't publish a book of more than 200 pages. I felt like we were at the start of something interesting there; I would've liked to hear more about it.In general, this confirms that I'm not a big fan of Hawking. He bills himself as ""science explained for the masses,"" but he doesn't actually explain things all that well - or, at least, there are folks who can explain it better. And in trying to cover so much in his books, he ends up covering nothing well enough."
259,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12508032-jyotsna,2,"Actual rating: 2.5 starsI kind of have mixed feelings about this book. What I did not like: This is a book by physicists for physicists. Being an engineer and having had a good interest in physics, the book was easier to read, but if any person with no background of physics picked this up, they would be totally lost! This book is not for the masses, it purely talks to those intellectuals in the science field. What I liked: The good explanation of physics and mainly theoretical physics as a whole. I liked the breakdown of various theories from Newtonian physics to Quantum physics.  The idea of attempting to explain the universe in a scientific manner does work as the writers assume that you have to go from A to Z and not feed you the intermediate steps directly. In short, a well organised book.Conclusion: Only read if you are actually aware of basic physics. Otherwise, you may not enjoy it that much."
260,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/651858-george-musser,2,"Frankly I found the book incoherent. It argues on the one hand that a final theory of physics is unattainable, because there's no objective way to decide among competing theories (a position they call ""model-dependent realism""), and on the other hand, it says that physicists have found such a theory: M-theory. The authors do not acknowledge this apparent contradiction, let alone explain how it might be resolved. (I personally think it can be done, but shouldn't the authors do this for us?) Crucial concepts, such as why M-theory should be taken as the final theory to begin with, are hardly explained, and the authors present model-dependent realism as though it were their own brainchild, not acknowledging the work of Poincare, Bohr, and the positivists."
261,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3657860-bob-finch,3,"The first half of the book was reasonably well presented, albeit very brief (most non-specialists would benefit from a lot more more background), but the remainder left me wanting. This is not a book for scientists, and unless the reader is willing to accept all that is said at face value, trying to find supporting information within these pages is largely futile (the motivated reader might search for such support elsewhere). And the punch line, that M-Theory (undefined) may answer all questions about the origins and nature of the physical universe, is pretty much left undeveloped. The book is nevertheless interesting if only to glean a bit of insight into some (pretty counter-intuitive) alternative explanations of reality. "
262,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55881076-robert-cox,2,Ima be honest with you. Physicists have no clue what’s going on.

I think this was just the book to do it. It is written in a clear, accessible style with hints of humor. I will say that I still dont understand string theory but my fiance's assures me that no one else does either."

He begins with basic principles and builds from there so the reader has a base from which to begin. Gravity is a focus. Terms are defined at the end. Antimatter is discussed as well as the expansion of the universe. I need to break down and just buy all of his books. "
265,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/623492-ayla,4,Fascinating audiobook on the universe and everything. 42! No wrong answer lol . Fun little book keeping with the simple layman explanation that Hawking did brilliantly. 
266,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162048-james-carroll,4,"""Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge."" Stephen HawkingI couldn't agree with that statement more. Some of his other conclusions in the book from which the quote was taken ""The Grand Design""... not so much.But in what way is philosophy dead? Clearly the love of wisdom is not dead, but it may well be that the field of liberal arts philosophy may indeed be dead (or at least loosing relevance and productivity). To attempt to discover the real truth requires more than sitting and thinking, it requires observation, and then modeling, which requires math. This means that today the mathematicians and physicists are doing the real leg work of philosophy, while the liberal arts philosophers are, for the most part, spinning their wheels. There is a feeling that theology and philosophy should be the ones asking the questions about morality, theology, meaning, and God, while science should keep its distance. But I believe that you can't ask these questions correctly without a firm grounding in the observations of science and physics, which MUST inform any inquiry into philosophy, or even theology. As Einstein said, science without theology is lame (in the sense of not having the power to move things forward), while theology without science is blind (in the sense of moving forward, but not seeing where it is really going). Therefore, I find that I simply can not agree with those that say that science should leave such theological matters to religion. In my view, Stephen Hawking has every right to venture into the field of theology, and to bravely see what implications his understanding of the laws of physics has on his understanding of God. This is a useful and potentially very productive undertaking.Let us take some of Hawking's conclusions in this book as an example, and see how science can inform theology:1. In the beginning, the world was very small, thus the rules of Quantum Mechanics hold, and things like the universe can (and indeed will) appear out of nothing without violating the rules of quantum mechanics, so long as it eventually cancels itself out, just as virtual particles usually do.2. The universe has an equal amount of positive and negative energy, and so is a cosmic free lunch, and can (and will) appear out of nothing (essentially, the universe cancels itself out, much like virtual particles do).3. But the universe was also hugely massive, so it followed not only the rules of quantum mechanics, but also the rules of relativity, which says that mass bends space and time, and at the point where you have enough mass to make a black hole (as we clearly had in the early universe), time itself stops, so there IS no time before the big bang, time curves back upon itself, and comes to a single closed point, creating a beginning not only of the universe, but of time itself, and thus it creates a beginning to the chain of causation. The chain of causation (where the causes come before the results) comes to an end at the Big bang, which necessarily had no cause, because there was no time before the big bang for that cause to act in. His conclusion? There is no God in the platonic sense of the ""prime mover"" or ""first cause"" because 1. we don't need him to explain how and why the universe could come into being, (quantum mechanics does that) and 2. there could be no creator of the universe, because there was no time before the universe was created for Him to act in. Essentially, God could not ""cause"" the universe, because relativity guarantees that there was no time in which he could act to initiate such a cause, and after the big bang bangs, we don't need Him to explain the progression of the universe from that point on (the laws of nature do that). Whether or not you agree with these conclusions (which I do not), it is clear that a firm understanding of the issues surrounding quantum mechanics should indeed necessarily inform our theology. Even if his reasoning here is flawed, that is the way science works. It is necessary for someone to make these sorts of inferences, so that science can move forward and either prove or disprove this theory.So, why don't I come to the same conclusions as Hawking? His reasoning appears rather solid at first glance. However, relativity and quantum mechanics are notorious for their inability to play nicely together, and there are a myriad of potential theories that have been proposed in an attempt to produce a good theory of quantum gravity. He is here espousing one of these theories, granted, it is the one that is (so far) the most mathematically robust, but it is by no means the only solution to this problem. For example, some theories of quantized time predict a big bounce instead of a big bang, in which case there was indeed time before the big bang. Another competing theory predicts that two of the membranes predicted by M-theory collided, producing the big bang, again, this is a theory that predicts time before the big bang. Still other theories predict that there are other dimensions of time, outside of our own. It is also unclear to some whether quantum fluctuations can create virtual particles without space or time in which to create them, which could cast doubt on whether a quantum fluctuation alone could create the universe from no-where and no-when. The possibilities are nearly endless. And, most importantly, we have yet to find observations that can clearly differentiate between many of these competing theories. Essentially, we have no observationally verified theory of quantum gravity, which is necessary before we can make any real predictions of how the universe behaved in these early moments that are so essential to Hawking's arguments.So, if we take this into consideration, we can rephrase Stephen Hawking's brilliant deduction differently. IF we accept THIS theory of quantum gravity, together with its predictions about quantum fluctuations and the beginning of time, THEN the universe necessarily had no cause within our dimension of time, and thus, there is no God that exists solely within our universe's dimension of time. I believe that this is a valid deduction, and, to some extent, it should inform our understanding of God. It is only unfortunate that he didn't state his conclusions with this level of cautiousness. Instead, he is far more confident in his conclusions than is warranted by the data, and he leaves out the many ""if""s that should have preceded his conclusion. This was perhaps my only serious disagreement with the Book.And what of my own conclusions about God? That is not really what this review is about, but to be short:Theleologians in my chosen branch of Christianity have often said that God does not just predict the future, he quite literally sees it. For this to be the case, God must, of necessity, exist outside of our dimension of time, and likely outside of our dimensions of space as well. I find the fact that science is now predicting a universe of multiple dimensions and multiple universes (some with different laws of physics), and is finding that God cannot exist only within our dimension of time and still create the universe, to be quite faith promoting since that is in line with what I believed all along. Stephen Hawking would likely take issue with my interpretation of his work, but hey, that is what Science is all about, and we should be grateful to Stephen Hawking for so clearly expressing this brilliant deduction.

267,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176602-shaimaa-ali,3,"In this book, both scientists (Hawking & Mlodinow) tried to explore an answer to so many existential questions.. “why do we exist?, why is there something rather than nothing?, why this particular set of laws and not some other?” .. in general, they tried to answer why the universe behave this way, not only to describe how .. Did they manage to do so?, I doubt!Trying first to disqualify Philosophy saying it’s dead ( although mere advances started first from philosophers’ thinking -true or false- but it was just a start!, then building the meaning of reality ( which was basically philosophical at first, then continued by simple explanations of Quantum Physics and some other terms: ( 4 forces of nature, General relativity, Special relativity, QED, QCD & GUT). All that was good & easy to follow, while some other terms & principals were not that easy [Like: re-normalization, W+, W- & Z0 particles , or other philosophical descriptions(again) as creating history by our own observations rather than history creating us], the last model of creation (Game of life) & its shape models was quite difficult to fathom!The last 2 chapters were quite contradictory to each other, while in Chapter 7 “The Apparent Miracle” was in my opinion an evidence that this universe can’t be a result of a coincidence as in page 160 ( Change those rules of our universe just a bit, and the conditions for our existence disappear! ), Chapter 8 “The Grand Design “ page 179, claims arrogantly that ( we are the creators - we choose the initial state of the universe by specifying objects and their positions at the start of the game). Where were we when we started selecting all these laws & conditions?!! The weakest point in this book, that it didn’t describe well the theories that the M-theory consists of, hence when last phrase in the book confirms that this theory isn’t confirmed by observations, then it became totally vague to confirm the writers’ opinion at all!! "
268,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,5,"Hawking the man is gone now, but the influence of his intellect remains. In this book he explains why there is something rather than nothing, and whether that existence requires a deity to drive it. He simplifies to a great extent an extraordinarily complex subject, although without a working understanding of the necessary math, no lay person can truly claim to understand the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, string theory, or M-theory. Hawking certainly makes it possible for us to get a feel for the subject, though, without scaring us away with equations. If you want a lucid introduction to current theories of cosmology, read this book. And Hawking's wry humor infuses the text. "

270,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,2,"The blurb calls this a major work. It's not. I know I'm in a minority, but I am not a fan of Stephen Hawking as a popularizer. Undeniably, he is a major physicist, and I remember liking his Brief History of Time, but I read that a long time ago. His popular works since are all very oversimplified, and this one could almost be considered as a children's or YA book -- I would have no problem with it if it were marketed as such. But as an adult book, it covers no new ground which is not covered in more depth in many other popular science books.He begins by saying that ""philosophy is dead"", replaced by science. Okay, as someone with a degree in philosophy that may have prejudiced me to begin with. He then spends about 15% of this very short book giving a lightweight history of philosophy, not only oversimplified but full of errors. For example, he calls Thomas Aquinas an ""early Christian philosopher"" -- even if we consider modern philosophers who happen to be Christians as ""Christian philosophers"", he was past the middle, closer to today in time than to the real ""early Christian"" philosophers like Tertullian, Origen and Augustine. He calls Aristotle the leader in rejecting observational science -- actually he was probably the best observational scientist in antiquity, especially in his specialty of marine biology. He contrasts him to Galileo on the question of falling bodies -- probably it was Aristotle who actually experimented on this, dropping objects in liquid to slow them down and thereby discovering the laws of bodies at final velocity; while Galileo certainly never dropped the balls from the tower of Pisa -- he didn't have the instruments to prove anything that way anyway -- and whether he did the experiment with inclined planes is open to doubt (his first edition talks about rolling balls, which would have given very different results than he claimed; the later editions correct it to sliding blocks.)Hawking then moves to physics ""lite"", and while I'm not presumptuous enough to claim there were errors, it was certainly very oversimplified. His ""philosophy"" of ""model-dependent realism"" is presented very simplistically, without any consideration of the philosophical issues it raises. He gives very briefly all the standard analogies and examples which are in every book on relativity and quantum theory, from the two-slit experiment to the inflating balloon, and almost nothing which is not found everywhere else. The book is very short; the actual text, excluding the glossary, acknowledgements and index (there is no bibliography at all), is about 180 pages, of which 30 are either just chapter titles, blank, or ornamental illustrations. The font size is very large, and there are unnecessary large illustrations throughout, giving it the appearance of a children's book -- I know he has physical limitations on writing long books, and has more important things to work on, but it would have been more honest to write a short book than to pad it out to look longer than it is.Only the last ten or fifteen pages have anything which might be new to some people (but it's all in his earlier books) -- the no-boundary condition as a basis for the multiverse, very lightly explained. I was very disappointed in this book."
271,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13151041-manish-sinha,4,"This book isn't for beginners. They should first read more simpler books before starting with this one. The first few chapters of the book are relatively easy to understand and need just basic physics to understand. It assumed you remember concepts of physics like matter-wave-duality. It even assumes you have a basic knowledge of our view of universe some two hundred years back like we are in center of universe etc.The book contains beautiful graphical depictions and photos. It makes the book easy to read and to some extent interesting.This book asks a beautiful philosophical question ""What is reality?"". It explains that our knowledge of ""reality"" keeps on changing as we question ourselves and build our the scientific temper.Later on in the book Hawking uses more difficult terms like space-time and references to Feynman which some people might want to skip if they don't have a stronger physics background.One of the most interesting chapter is ""Choosing our Universe"". In that chapter he explains Creation myths in various cultures and traditions. Then he goes ahead and explains the big bang and how galaxies are expanding, terms like gravity well, space-time wrap etc.Explaining the book in more detail would act like a baaad spoiler. I guess my review did act a spoiler to some extent, but I would prefer to put it forward as a ""trailer"" to the beautiful journey of reading the book."

Of course, Hawking is a huge authority in the eyes of the public, so the layperson will eat this stuff up, hook, line, and sinker.

276,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"As a longtime fan of the popular science books of the late Stephen Hawking it is nice to be able to extolled his book co-authorized by Leonard Mlodinow, The Grand Design. Because so much of this book is about quantum mechanics it can be hard on almost all readers. Advanced level readers will find it too basic and perhaps dislike the orientation/history that opens the book. Readers with little or no background should be relatively comfortable. For myself I remember the several versions of the statements made in this book. If you think you understand Quantum, you don’t. Or the better one: If thinking about Quantum mechanics does not blow your mind, then you do not understand it.Having read the book, I can say without shame that my mind is blown, but in a very positive way. The lack of lineal logic makes a logic of its own. I had been one to argue, loudly that ours is a world of cause and effect. Not fully appreciating I was stuck in a Newtonian world and behind by everything since before Einstein. The universe is much more likely: cause and most likely or probable effect. The various qualifiers “likely” and “probable” are deliberate and more in line with a host of things we now think we know and that call into question a lot about what we were certain we knew. Physics and math still rule but only up to a more or less predictable limit.A friend of mine, a Ph. D Physics and with profound religious beliefs once proposed that the space between cause and effect and cause and probable effect is where God can(?) express his/her will. He may be right.Two specific explanations in The Grand Design stand out as particularly enlightening. We are bound by our senses in what we can understand. If we are so many gold fishes living in gold fishbowls, our view of the universe would be of a more curved and less linear universe. Our models of the universe would reflect our experience of relating to the universe through the distortion of the gold fish bowl. It would be unlikely that any experiment we designed or results we generated could be controlled for the limits on our ability to comprehend our model of the universe. It is therefore just as likely that as humans we are bound to the universe we are in and unable to build experiments beyond the limits of this particular universe. Could we escape the limits of the models we can imagine and the limits on reading our test results, it may be that we could close the gap in the in the probable side of cause and effect, or we might just find new ways to reach the same limitationsAgainst those who write science fiction based on the notion that there are other universes, and play with the variations possible in a ‘mega’ universe of unlimited alternate universes, Hawking and Mlodinow limit the number of possible universes to something like 1 *10 to the 100th power. So we are in one of a google-plex of possible worlds and that number can vary as some will be less stable than others. Creating an ongoing cycle of new ones from the matter and energy of the less stable.On a more specific level, I had never had much respect for Feynman’s concept of sum over histories. That any given time particles take every possible path to where ever they are finally detected. Rather like one of us buying tickets from LA to Las Vegas via every possible combination of flights that leave the LA Airport in any given time but ultimately connect to the McCarran International Airport in North Vegas. Nevermind the problem of us being in several airplanes at the same time. Quantum allows for that, or something like it; who among us has at the sub atomic or economic level has that much energy or that much money? Via the illustrations and the rest, I think I almost get that in the sum over histories, some possibilities cancel out others with the results favoring only a few probabilities. So that maybe LA to Bakersfield to Las Vegas makes some kind of sense and therefore has some probability; while LA to Hong Kong to Atlanta, back to San Francisco and then to Vegas, not as much.Having read other Stephen Hawking’s books before, The Grand Design has some very high quality illustrations and some wonderful cartoons. In the cartoons I detect the famous Hawking’s wit but in the great and greatly helpful illustrations I speculate that I see the previously unknown (to me) hand of Leonard Mlodinow.Once again a relatively readable book. Perhaps better for the sometime dabbler in physics and less so for the serious student. In my day we had college classes affectionately known as Physics for poets. The Grand Design might be perfect for that reader."

Thanks to this book, I had a glance at the amazing world of modern physics that I couldn't find anywhere else since all the documentries that claim explaining those concepts do nothing but mystifying us even more.Though it is a pro-atheist assay, the scientific concepts are well explained and nicely illustrated. What we know today about our universe is amazingly puzzling ! Scientific theories are now based on mathematics so advanced that they no longer agree with our everyday experience, and it makes them hard to imagine. Space, time, the cause-and-effect principle and other corner stones of our reasoning are twisted and sometimes abandoned in modern physics. Though the authour doesn't see any other miracle in all of these phenomena but the maths and us wodering about it, I see miracles everywhere ! "
278,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54949416-najmi-ayob,5,"A great book, provocative yet amazing. This book is proposing M-theory (a candidate for the TOE) but it does so gracefully. One does not simply shove quantum physics and the questions of laws of nature so easily at people. To introduce ""heavy"" concepts, the authors infused the appropriate amount of relatable humours. The authors also beautifully picked up human histories that reflects each modern achievement in physics, which is very interesting to look at. This is indeed the first time I have ever smile and laughed at a book about quantum physics. Oh Lord, I love the language. It is so easy to understand the language yet it is by no means superficial. It is as grand as its title. I would suggest all science students to make this book a compulsory reading, for its ways of argument and logic will be very helpful. It is also helpful for those who are practicing to communicate the sciences. Science in this book, is very well-communicated."
279,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12011253-mikael-cerbing,4,"This is an interesting book in many ways. I have read a fair bit of science history so those parts of the book I already knew and understood (mostly). But when it comes to the actuall science I have no idea. I recognise a fair bit of it from earlier readings, but recognition and understanding is two compleatly different things. Then again, can you understand modern physics? You can understand the math, the experiments and the applications. But can you really grasp what it means? As a monkey from the grass plains of Africa. “If you are not completely confused by quantum mechanics, you do not understand it” as one physisist put it. And I am both confused and I dont understand it. But that is not the fault of this book, its me and (I am pretty sure) my evoultionary history. Planck scale makes no sense. The big numbers in this book makes no sense. My brain has not evolved to grasp these concepts. And I dont think anyones have. But if you have the math, at least you can get a theoretical understanding of it. I have no idea if the M-theory is the right one, no one seems to do, so I Guess we will have to wait another 20-30 years and see what they find out. "
280,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50996094-blue,4,"I liked this book - I have experience studying physics and enjoyed the conceptual review ths book offered which also managed to sting the ideas together in a way schooling left arather disconnected in favour of maths and problem practice. There were many jokes snuck into the writing, some reminding me strongly of A Series of Unfortunate Events (paraphrased from this book: symmetrical like a doughnut, unless one side has chocolate topping in which case it would be better to eat it.) The jokes could be odd or incongruous but were not dwelt upon which gave them an added charm of just being snuck in. The philosophical nature of the books ideas, and how easily points could be applied outside of science did well at grabbing my imagination."

It certainly does give the reader many ideas to think about. In an attempt to make scientific discussion more palatable to the layman, corny jokes were scattered throughout the book. I could have done without those. "
282,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28036690-ahmad-tekriti,4,I enjoyed this book or to be accurate 67% of it. Some ideas and concepts are hard for me to understand it due to some technical concepts and information that i barely know about i. it triggers and arises some questions in me outside my every day life scope. Does quantum physics in some cases (as electrons could be at 2 places at once) violates logic (non contradiction law as example) ? 
283,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow (Note. This is a revised review. I was unhappy with the original.) ""The Grand Design"" is one of the most ambitious books ever written by one of the world's great thinkers. It attempts to answer the ultimate questions of life through science. The ultimate question of course and the title of this book, is the apparent grand design offer proof for a supernatural designer. This fascinating 208-page book, is composed of the following eight chapters: 1. The Mystery of Being, 2. The Rule of Law, 3. What Is Reality, 4. Alternative Histories, 5. The Theory of Everything, 6. Choosing Our Universe, 7. The Apparent Miracle, and 8. The Grand Design. Positives: 1. An ambitious book that is well-written, well-researched and concise. 2. Surprisingly accessible book that is profound without being unintelligible. 3. Evenhanded, respectful tone throughout. 4. In essence, a modern update to life's biggest questions. 5. No complex mathematical equations to worry about, elegant prose was used to convey concepts. 6. Great use of illustrations. 7. This book is in essence about the M-theory Network. What phenomena it describes and what are the limitations. 8. Thought-provoking book indeed and fascinating quotes, ""Ignorance of nature's ways led people in ancient times to invent gods to lord it over every aspect of human life"". 9. An interesting look at the history of scientific inquiry. 10. Fascinating tidbits throughout. 11. The debunking of free will. 12. The explanation of what constitutes an effective theory in physics. 13. Model-dependent realism defined. Very interesting. 14. The explanation of what quantum physics really is. 15. Special and general relativity in context. 16. The search for quantum versions of the laws of physics. 17. The never-ending quest for the theory of everything. 18. The history of the ""big bang"". 19. A clear explanation of what we do know versus what we don't know. 20. The realization that time behaves like space... 21. The anthropic principles defined. 22. The triple alpha process...who knew? 23. The multiverse concept defined and how it can explain the fine-tuning of physical laws. 24. Spontaneous creation. 25. A much needed glossary of terms. Negatives: 1. Will disappoint the more scientifically minded as this book was written for the masses. 2. This is an accessible book by design but the nature of physics is so complex that it will still leave some readers dumfounded. 3. The book's hype may have lead some readers with the wrong impression and thus not satisfied with the end result. 4. I think some readers expected new groundbreaking ideas (and please correct me if I'm wrong) but in reality it's a book that provides the latest in scientific knowledge and future aspirations. 5. Philosophy is still alive and well. 6. He has yet to find the Holy Grail of Physics. In other words, the book feels incomplete because it is. In summary, this is a very solid concise book but it doesn't ultimately answer all the questions and will leave those readers with higher albeit unreasonable expectations with a degree of dissatisfaction. It's a book meant for the masses and in that respect accomplishes what it sought out to do. However, for those with higher physics acumen this book as evidenced by the reviews from readers who hold Hawking in high regard, it will be disappointing. If you are a layperson this book is a worthwhile read, on the other hand wait for a more advanced edition or book. Recommendations: ""Physics of the Future"" by Michio Kaku, ""The Age of Everything"" by Mathew Hedman, and ""The Elegant Universe"" by Brian Greene."

285,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256070-jose,2,"I think this book deserves one star but I can't bring myself to give that rating to a book by the great Stephen Hawking. I don't even know where to start... if you read A Brief History of Time just reread that. That book is light years ahead and I honestly thought maybe this one was meant for adolescents. There is some interesting discussion in the beginning about the nature of physical models but it is quickly abandoned. Ok that's fine, bring on the ""real"" science right? Wrong. In fact the entire book rushes through topics quickly and unsatisfyingly. There are a few nuggets but for a book that I read in just 3 QUICK sittings this is not enough. I did like reading it but it was all stuff I had seen before and to better depth. Maybe I just came with too high of expectations.The book claims to offer answers to the BIG questions. If you didn't know much about modern physics and saw this get ready for a big disappointment. Surprise! science doesn't know why the universe came into existence. It also doesn't know why the universe has the laws it does have. The book claims it is because there are many universes and we happen to be in one with ""good"" laws. Does that pass anybody's BS test? In fact, upon my reading it's hard not to conclude that current physics is pretty utterly lost. I don't know how Mr. Hawking can think string theory is anything more than a giant math trick. Physical theories have to be experimentally grounded and M Theory is a joke. By the way, it is barely, barely defined here! Not even the traditional high level description of it. I'm sorry but when our best unified physical theory for the universe calls for the existence of an enormous amount of parallel universes and is untestable... it is worthless. "
286,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5496860-julie-shennan,1,"THE problem with Stephen Hawking’s creation theory is it’s not his theory. His latest novel The Grand Design paraphrases every scientific, religious and mythological hypothesis of the universe, except his own. After 180 pages of mind numbing reading, I reached the conclusion, hoping beyond hope, this would be Hawking’s big revelation. Alas, it wasn’t, instead he said, ‘the M - theory is the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe’...That would be Edward Witten’s M Theory. What is this M Theory? Well, I got the impression that it was just a combination of theories which offered a spatial reading of creation, no pun intended. These theories outline that cosmos aren’t linear so don’t have a set matter, place, era or event in which they started, such as the creation of our universe. The theories also state multiple universes were created at the same time, with different environments and natural laws.Hawkins argues this spatial reading of creation clashes with the Christian First Cause Theory, because it suggests that there was never a blank canvas for God to create life from. He also claims that the simultaneous creation of multiple universes suggest that our planet is not unique in its hospitable climate, and so was not created especially for us, as the Grand Design theory suggests.Yet, Hawkins critique of Christianity is unoriginal, and with no evidence to further Edward Witten’s theory I can’t help but think if The Grand Design were a dissertation, it would merit a fail."
287,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45877282-jeffrey-debris,5,"It's almost impossible to imagine that Stephen Hawking has passed away. He was one of our brightest minds and reading this book has changed the way I perceive reality in quite a few ways. The book starts with this sentence: ""We each exist for but a short time, and in that time explore but a small part of the whole universe."" Given just how mindbogglingly big our universe is, this sentence hit home right away for me.Hawking then goes on to inspire us, by saying that the Human species is a curious one, in constant search of answers to questions. This book aims to answer a couple of the great ones in our lives. What is reality? Does God exist? Does a multiverse exist?Each chapter in this wonderful book aims at giving an answer to these important questions. Hawking lays it all out in front of the reader in language that even the layman (like me) can understand. He does so with a smooth writing style and a touch of humour, which keeps things a bit lighter than they really are.This is one of those books you really want to have in your collection for more than one reason. It aims to explain, but it will also spark your imagination, and make you want to learn more about our universe. I will definitely pick this one up again at some time, simply to remind myself just how brilliant a mind Stephen Hawking had and how science can possibly be our greatest hope of survival in this crazy, chaotic world we live in."
288,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,3,"Hawking is a terrific self-promoter, and he managed to grab a lot of headlines for this book by claiming he'd killed God or whatever, but the truth is there's very little in this book that Brian Greene didn't cover - and cover better - ten years ago. In fact, a lot of this is stuff Hawking himself has covered in A Brief History of Time.In the last chapter he brings up Conway and Turing and things get significantly more interesting, but it's too late by that time, since Hawking apparently feels he can't publish a book of more than 200 pages. I felt like we were at the start of something interesting there; I would've liked to hear more about it.In general, this confirms that I'm not a big fan of Hawking. He bills himself as ""science explained for the masses,"" but he doesn't actually explain things all that well - or, at least, there are folks who can explain it better. And in trying to cover so much in his books, he ends up covering nothing well enough."
289,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12508032-jyotsna,2,"Actual rating: 2.5 starsI kind of have mixed feelings about this book. What I did not like: This is a book by physicists for physicists. Being an engineer and having had a good interest in physics, the book was easier to read, but if any person with no background of physics picked this up, they would be totally lost! This book is not for the masses, it purely talks to those intellectuals in the science field. What I liked: The good explanation of physics and mainly theoretical physics as a whole. I liked the breakdown of various theories from Newtonian physics to Quantum physics.  The idea of attempting to explain the universe in a scientific manner does work as the writers assume that you have to go from A to Z and not feed you the intermediate steps directly. In short, a well organised book.Conclusion: Only read if you are actually aware of basic physics. Otherwise, you may not enjoy it that much."
290,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/651858-george-musser,2,"Frankly I found the book incoherent. It argues on the one hand that a final theory of physics is unattainable, because there's no objective way to decide among competing theories (a position they call ""model-dependent realism""), and on the other hand, it says that physicists have found such a theory: M-theory. The authors do not acknowledge this apparent contradiction, let alone explain how it might be resolved. (I personally think it can be done, but shouldn't the authors do this for us?) Crucial concepts, such as why M-theory should be taken as the final theory to begin with, are hardly explained, and the authors present model-dependent realism as though it were their own brainchild, not acknowledging the work of Poincare, Bohr, and the positivists."
291,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3657860-bob-finch,3,"The first half of the book was reasonably well presented, albeit very brief (most non-specialists would benefit from a lot more more background), but the remainder left me wanting. This is not a book for scientists, and unless the reader is willing to accept all that is said at face value, trying to find supporting information within these pages is largely futile (the motivated reader might search for such support elsewhere). And the punch line, that M-Theory (undefined) may answer all questions about the origins and nature of the physical universe, is pretty much left undeveloped. The book is nevertheless interesting if only to glean a bit of insight into some (pretty counter-intuitive) alternative explanations of reality. "

296,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162048-james-carroll,4,"""Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge."" Stephen HawkingI couldn't agree with that statement more. Some of his other conclusions in the book from which the quote was taken ""The Grand Design""... not so much.But in what way is philosophy dead? Clearly the love of wisdom is not dead, but it may well be that the field of liberal arts philosophy may indeed be dead (or at least loosing relevance and productivity). To attempt to discover the real truth requires more than sitting and thinking, it requires observation, and then modeling, which requires math. This means that today the mathematicians and physicists are doing the real leg work of philosophy, while the liberal arts philosophers are, for the most part, spinning their wheels. There is a feeling that theology and philosophy should be the ones asking the questions about morality, theology, meaning, and God, while science should keep its distance. But I believe that you can't ask these questions correctly without a firm grounding in the observations of science and physics, which MUST inform any inquiry into philosophy, or even theology. As Einstein said, science without theology is lame (in the sense of not having the power to move things forward), while theology without science is blind (in the sense of moving forward, but not seeing where it is really going). Therefore, I find that I simply can not agree with those that say that science should leave such theological matters to religion. In my view, Stephen Hawking has every right to venture into the field of theology, and to bravely see what implications his understanding of the laws of physics has on his understanding of God. This is a useful and potentially very productive undertaking.Let us take some of Hawking's conclusions in this book as an example, and see how science can inform theology:1. In the beginning, the world was very small, thus the rules of Quantum Mechanics hold, and things like the universe can (and indeed will) appear out of nothing without violating the rules of quantum mechanics, so long as it eventually cancels itself out, just as virtual particles usually do.2. The universe has an equal amount of positive and negative energy, and so is a cosmic free lunch, and can (and will) appear out of nothing (essentially, the universe cancels itself out, much like virtual particles do).3. But the universe was also hugely massive, so it followed not only the rules of quantum mechanics, but also the rules of relativity, which says that mass bends space and time, and at the point where you have enough mass to make a black hole (as we clearly had in the early universe), time itself stops, so there IS no time before the big bang, time curves back upon itself, and comes to a single closed point, creating a beginning not only of the universe, but of time itself, and thus it creates a beginning to the chain of causation. The chain of causation (where the causes come before the results) comes to an end at the Big bang, which necessarily had no cause, because there was no time before the big bang for that cause to act in. His conclusion? There is no God in the platonic sense of the ""prime mover"" or ""first cause"" because 1. we don't need him to explain how and why the universe could come into being, (quantum mechanics does that) and 2. there could be no creator of the universe, because there was no time before the universe was created for Him to act in. Essentially, God could not ""cause"" the universe, because relativity guarantees that there was no time in which he could act to initiate such a cause, and after the big bang bangs, we don't need Him to explain the progression of the universe from that point on (the laws of nature do that). Whether or not you agree with these conclusions (which I do not), it is clear that a firm understanding of the issues surrounding quantum mechanics should indeed necessarily inform our theology. Even if his reasoning here is flawed, that is the way science works. It is necessary for someone to make these sorts of inferences, so that science can move forward and either prove or disprove this theory.So, why don't I come to the same conclusions as Hawking? His reasoning appears rather solid at first glance. However, relativity and quantum mechanics are notorious for their inability to play nicely together, and there are a myriad of potential theories that have been proposed in an attempt to produce a good theory of quantum gravity. He is here espousing one of these theories, granted, it is the one that is (so far) the most mathematically robust, but it is by no means the only solution to this problem. For example, some theories of quantized time predict a big bounce instead of a big bang, in which case there was indeed time before the big bang. Another competing theory predicts that two of the membranes predicted by M-theory collided, producing the big bang, again, this is a theory that predicts time before the big bang. Still other theories predict that there are other dimensions of time, outside of our own. It is also unclear to some whether quantum fluctuations can create virtual particles without space or time in which to create them, which could cast doubt on whether a quantum fluctuation alone could create the universe from no-where and no-when. The possibilities are nearly endless. And, most importantly, we have yet to find observations that can clearly differentiate between many of these competing theories. Essentially, we have no observationally verified theory of quantum gravity, which is necessary before we can make any real predictions of how the universe behaved in these early moments that are so essential to Hawking's arguments.So, if we take this into consideration, we can rephrase Stephen Hawking's brilliant deduction differently. IF we accept THIS theory of quantum gravity, together with its predictions about quantum fluctuations and the beginning of time, THEN the universe necessarily had no cause within our dimension of time, and thus, there is no God that exists solely within our universe's dimension of time. I believe that this is a valid deduction, and, to some extent, it should inform our understanding of God. It is only unfortunate that he didn't state his conclusions with this level of cautiousness. Instead, he is far more confident in his conclusions than is warranted by the data, and he leaves out the many ""if""s that should have preceded his conclusion. This was perhaps my only serious disagreement with the Book.And what of my own conclusions about God? That is not really what this review is about, but to be short:Theleologians in my chosen branch of Christianity have often said that God does not just predict the future, he quite literally sees it. For this to be the case, God must, of necessity, exist outside of our dimension of time, and likely outside of our dimensions of space as well. I find the fact that science is now predicting a universe of multiple dimensions and multiple universes (some with different laws of physics), and is finding that God cannot exist only within our dimension of time and still create the universe, to be quite faith promoting since that is in line with what I believed all along. Stephen Hawking would likely take issue with my interpretation of his work, but hey, that is what Science is all about, and we should be grateful to Stephen Hawking for so clearly expressing this brilliant deduction.

297,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176602-shaimaa-ali,3,"In this book, both scientists (Hawking & Mlodinow) tried to explore an answer to so many existential questions.. “why do we exist?, why is there something rather than nothing?, why this particular set of laws and not some other?” .. in general, they tried to answer why the universe behave this way, not only to describe how .. Did they manage to do so?, I doubt!Trying first to disqualify Philosophy saying it’s dead ( although mere advances started first from philosophers’ thinking -true or false- but it was just a start!, then building the meaning of reality ( which was basically philosophical at first, then continued by simple explanations of Quantum Physics and some other terms: ( 4 forces of nature, General relativity, Special relativity, QED, QCD & GUT). All that was good & easy to follow, while some other terms & principals were not that easy [Like: re-normalization, W+, W- & Z0 particles , or other philosophical descriptions(again) as creating history by our own observations rather than history creating us], the last model of creation (Game of life) & its shape models was quite difficult to fathom!The last 2 chapters were quite contradictory to each other, while in Chapter 7 “The Apparent Miracle” was in my opinion an evidence that this universe can’t be a result of a coincidence as in page 160 ( Change those rules of our universe just a bit, and the conditions for our existence disappear! ), Chapter 8 “The Grand Design “ page 179, claims arrogantly that ( we are the creators - we choose the initial state of the universe by specifying objects and their positions at the start of the game). Where were we when we started selecting all these laws & conditions?!! The weakest point in this book, that it didn’t describe well the theories that the M-theory consists of, hence when last phrase in the book confirms that this theory isn’t confirmed by observations, then it became totally vague to confirm the writers’ opinion at all!! "
298,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,5,"Hawking the man is gone now, but the influence of his intellect remains. In this book he explains why there is something rather than nothing, and whether that existence requires a deity to drive it. He simplifies to a great extent an extraordinarily complex subject, although without a working understanding of the necessary math, no lay person can truly claim to understand the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, string theory, or M-theory. Hawking certainly makes it possible for us to get a feel for the subject, though, without scaring us away with equations. If you want a lucid introduction to current theories of cosmology, read this book. And Hawking's wry humor infuses the text. "
